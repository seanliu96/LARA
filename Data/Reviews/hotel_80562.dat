<Title>“Beautiful location and great staff!”
<Content>I recently visited for a conference and was enchanted by the beautiful city of San Diego. We were lucky enough to stay here and had a wonderful time. We arrived early in the morning and expected to stow our luggage and go until check-in, but the staff found a room for us. All the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Bryan F. at the Tapatini was very charming and one of the hardest-working guys I've seen. The location on the Marina is lovely. It is a jaunt to downtown (about 2.5 miles), but it's a pretty walk. The Old Town Trolley does make a stop here in the morning and is a great way to explore the city. There is also a car rental place not too far. I would certainly return to this beautiful hotel anytime.

<Title>“great stay”
<Content>I was a little worried due to the varied reviews of the property. I had a great experience all around, particularly in all of the areas that seemed to have been problems for other visitors. It might have been the time of year, though as I know busy seasons tend to show in the service one receives. Hospitality was professional and friendly, room was clean (I immediately checked everything that other guests had reported problems with - bathrooms, carpet, linens, which were all spotless). Room service was prompt (even faster than they promised for one dinner on a Friday night!), food was good. I upgraded to a Club room which was totally worth it. Beautiful view and room, great Club food and drink, along with ambience of the Club. Again, may have been time of year because everything was quite smooth and nice.

<Title>“Terrible hotel for a conference!”
<Content>This is not a good hotel to hold a conference. It is convienent to the airport but once there you must take an expensive cab to go anywhere. The hotel food is expensive , $10.00 for a bowl of oatmeal! If you want to eat anywhere else, you must take a cab. It is NOT close to any other services. Internet is ONLY available for a charge of 11.95 per Day in your room. The lobby does have free wireless but only had about two plugs which was very inadequate for 1000 peopke attending a conference. I would not reccommend holding a conference here - you may pay a little bit more to be downtown but you will not have to take a cab and you will have better food choices

<Title>“great view, lots of little annoyances”
<Content>Based on previous reviews, I booked a room in the Bay Tower. The view was awesome...but there were other minor things that detracted from my stay. (1) The water for my shower was only lukewarm 2 out of 3 mornings. (2) The walls are paper thin. I could hear people talking next door & in the hall, also heard every time people in the room above flushed the toilet (they are VERY loud), walked, & took a shower, etc. (3) The website doesn't state that it's about 1/4 to 1/3 mile walk from the Bay Tower to the Marina Tower where the main hotel and larger conference venue are located. I love to walk...but not in business shoes. (4) Food prices at the hotel restaurants are about the most outrageous I've ever seen, even for a higher-end hotel in a major city. $9 for a bowl of oatmeal?! $15 for a hamburger?! Thankfully the deli/diner half-way between the 2 buildings had great, inexpensive food for breakfast & lunch. If you are going for a conference, I'd recommend staying at the Marina for convenience sake, unless the view is all that matters.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>The hotel was wonderful. A beautiful water view. It is close to Symphony Hall and the location of the San Diego Opera. It is about 2 miles from center city where there are lots of things to see. You must go to the San Diego Zoo if you have children. Our children live in San Diego and this hotel is a good place to stay and get around the city with a car.

<Title>“Great room convenient to airport”
<Content>We got a great deal on this hotel for last-minute travel to San Diego. We were pleasantly surprised by the beautiful harbor views and the crisp, clean, nautical themed rooms. Although our room faced the parking lot, the balcony was nice in the mornings to get some sunshine and fresh air. One night we returned from dinner to our room smelling of cigarette smoke. When my husband opened the sliding door to see if it was someone outside, the smell came rushing in. Since it's a non-smoking property, I called the front desk and they immediately sent up security. The gentleman was there in 2 minutes and agreed that the room was not suitable. Within 5 minutes of my initial call they promptly moved us to another room on the opposite side of the building. Excellent customer service from a rather irritating situation!

<Title>“Great room with a view”
<Content>The rooms were nice, the views even better. We had a room that had a view of the marina and the San Diego bay cityline. The nighttime view of the city lights was great. Rooms were well appointed, comfortable bed, clean updated room and bathrooms, even have Peter Thomas Roth bath amenities (as a woman, I appreciated this very much! ^_^) It was a short trip to get downtown, SD Zoo and Seaworld and not too bad to Coronado as well, where we had dinner plans one evening. There is also a hotel restaurant for convenience. Across the hotel is a walking path by the water which was also nice. The area has restaurants and bars within walking distance and is also by the airport (which is good for plane watching or aviation photography -my fiance enjoyed it) Overall it was a great place to stay. Nice, clean convenient and parking was not far nor crowded and it was fairly cheaper than downtown hotel parking. I would give it 5 stars except the room we had was a bit small. King bed and furniture with one large suitcase had us walking over our stuff to get to the bathroom. But traveling as a couple, I wasn't bothered much by it.

<Title>“Great hotel with wonderful service near airport.”
<Content>A very busy hotel with lots of features including a massive lagoon pool and new fitness equipment. The pub-style restaurant bar is nice and the waitstaff are excellent. Just very over-priced for a pub however the food was very good. The main restaurant has a great buffet breakfast and the service was wonderful. Rooms were very clean and the hotel has stunning views if you're lucky enough to get into the marina building. Really nice hot tub that is quite large and actually HOT. Too bad the pool was so cold. Great hotel and the staff are excellent.

<Title>“Beautiful views, nice location...”
<Content>Right next to the airport and situated on the bay this hotel has picture perfect views of the city from one side and views of a marina and Point Loma peninsula on the other when you stay in the main tower. The rooms are bright and clean, the decks offer great views, the pools are large and inviting, and the location is a short cab ride to the city. The in-room dining choices are limited, but service is fast. There's a bar restaurant in the lobby that offers decent food at decent prices. There are conference facilities in this hotel, so if you're looking to avoid corporate crowds this may not be the place for you. Overall I was very happy with the four days I just spent here and want to come back again to see more of the city.

<Title>“Convenient location - if have car - terrible hotel service”
<Content>We stayed in the "Bay Tower," which is a separate building, around the corner about 1/2 mile from the main building. The Bay Tower used to be a Ramada...and still looks like it. We were unable to check in early, were told they put a pending on our room to clean first, so we could check in after flying for 8 hours, and would call us. They never called, so we checked in at 2:50 pm, only to be given a room we did not choose or pay for. After arguing, they moved us. Then, cleaning service did not come the next day while we were out of our room between 9:45am and 3:15pm. I called guest services to alert of this - did nothing except bring up fresh towels. Then, cleaning service called us because we had a do not disturb sign on the door after 3:15pm when they wanted to clean. Housekeeping also banged on our door three times the morning of check-out. The hotel charges an arm and leg for each LOCAL phone call, do notice the little sheet of paper near the phone explaining this...something I did not notice. They charge for the Internet - two prices, daily, and charge for the self parking. The bar charged $70 for 5 beers and two, small bottles of water. The in-room convenient prices were equally as expensive. The room was their deluxe king, on the 8th floor facing the bay. Nice view, nice little balcony, which was the only thing we enjoyed - although the weather was unseasonably cold, extremely windy and rainy. The bed was uncomfortable and the furniture looked old and dingy. I did ask for an adjustment on the bill, but guest services would not budge and did not seem to care at all. I also used the spa at the main building. They gave me a key to a locker that didn't work. After fiddling with it for 5 minutes or so, I asked for a new locker and explained the lock was malfunctioning. The staff person said, "yes, a work order has been called in..." I explained she should not have given me that locker then. She didn't seem to care. I was the only person in the spa. So, I have stayed at the Loew's Coronado for the same price and had much better service and rooms. I chose to stay here for a more convenient location. Not worth saving the 10-12 minute drive. Yes, I am particular and have not a problem paying for good service and amenities, however, my experience was definitely poor and worth giving a head's up to others.

<Title>“Perfect”
<Content>This hotel actually has two towers. I stayed in the secondary tower (not the main tower with the club lounge, etc). Initially, I was concerned that the secondary tower would be a grave inconvenience. However, the room was quiet, beautifully decorated, extremely spacious, and offered the most beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean. However, to eat in the Club Lounge we had to walk to the primary tower. Fortunately the weather was beautiful and the walk was inviting. The Club Lounge Breakfast was a perfect start of the day. The food was fresh and tasty. Also, the coffee/cappuccino machine is something you must try. The staff were very nice and quite accommodating. This hotel is close to everything in the city, but not in the immediate midst of the hustle and bustle. Also, it is approximately 3 mins from the airport. I could not have asked for a better hotel stay.

<Title>“Great hotel!”
<Content>We reserved this room on the backside of our vacation to Maui. After a sleepless night at the Hampton Inn, we happened to drive by the Sheraton on the way to the airport early for our flight to Maui. Noticing how very close it is to the airport, we decided to book for our return. Upon arrival, we only had to wait about five minutes for a shuttle to the hotel at around 10pm. Their shuttle operates from 4am until 12 midnight. We were checked in and in our beds by 11 o'clock. We realized that their restaurant didn't open until 6:30 a.m., and we needed to leave for the airport early the next morning. So, we ordered our breakfast by leaving the menu tag hanging on our door to be delivered between 6 and 6:15 a.m. At 5:58 a.m. it was cheerfully delivered hot, and as ordered with a newspaper. We arrived downstairs a few minutes before seven, and were picked up by the airport shuttle within minutes. The bed was very comfortable, bathroom super clean, and room very quiet with a view of the harbor.

<Title>“Bad experience”
<Content>Me and my boyfriend were there from the 23rd to the 26th of Febuary 2012. We were not satisfied with this hotel because we got there with high expectatives due to the brand name of Sheraton and the price of the room, just with this you would expect a quality and clean room. 1. We arrived to the room we were assigned and it was dirty( it wasn't clean from the last stay of unknowns) 2. They immediately changed us to the room in front. The bathtub was dirty, the sheets were brownish in some part and the bathroom was full of hair( this just one more time gave the impression that the hotel WAS NOT CLEAN. 3. They moved us up to a Suite( which was even smaller than the regular guest room) and what we do recognize is that they gave us free breakfast for both of us for the 3 nights we were there. Overall I would not recommend this hotel. Not such a good location wither because you must have a car to go to the center for dinner, lunch, any other activity you want.

<Title>“Spring Break 2012”
<Content>First of all let me start by saying the shuttle from the airport was waiting when we got there. Our luggage was arriving later in which the airlines and hotel took care of. We had a room in the Marina tower on the 8th floor great view (main tower). Employees at the hotel were amazing. Breakfast buffet in the restaurant was great every morning. Boyd the food and beverage manager was not only professional but extremely friendly. Totally makes sense as to why the staff was the same way. Carlos was fantastic and the other servers we had were good also although I can not remember their names. (sigh) The highlight of our trip to this hotel was Doug in the restaurant. AMAZING!!!! Not only was he knowledgable about the places we were going he let us know what we should try and look for. For instance Knott's Berry Farm...he suggested the pie and fried chicken....WOW!!! Was he right. We even brought him a piece of pie back as a thank you. Our children looked forward to their talks with Doug at breakfast. The first day he asked us how smart are kids were and of course like every parent we say they are brilliant. Doug then presented them with a riddle and they answered correctly. He was happy about that. Our kids wrote him a note when we left with a picture of his favorite animal in the zoo an okapi. It is people like that that make trips so memorable. All that to say we had a fantastic stay at the Sheraton Marina San Diego. Thank you Doug and Boyd Young for a great experience!!

<Title>“Great stay!”
<Content>I really enjoyed my couple of nights here. I stayed in the Bay Tower which is the smaller hotel approx 10 min walk from the Marina Tower. I was on the 7th floor with a stunning view of the marina from the large balcony. The rooms are very big and nicely decorated (30% bigger than Marina Tower rooms I was told). Bed was super comfortable. I walked through the Marina Tower which is a much bigger hotel. The lobby is more impressive and the bar/restaurant there was more happening, plus there is Starbucks there...the Bay Tower just has a bar/restaurant. I was more than content with the Bay Tower though! I reserved through the Sheraton website and got a ridiculously good deal, $130ish. I paid 4 times that much for one night at a hotel in Santa Monica! Location: it's a bit far from downtown, but if you love to walk, as we do, it's fine, plus you are walking by the water so it's really pretty. A cab to the zoo cost $20 incld tip, cab from the Gaslamp was $15 with tip. Given the great rate it made sense for us to stay a little further out and take the occasional cab.

<Title>“Nice rooms, Horrible service”
<Content>I came here for a conference in March for 3 days. The central reservation center made in error in my reservation and did not book the room for the last night of my stay but instead reserved the room for the night of my departure. I discovered this upon my arrival to the hotel. The check-in staff informed me that they were sold of out of rooms for the last night. The hotel manager on duty then said all Starwood hotels were sold out in the area and that it was up to me find my own accommodations! So basically I took it upon myself by calling the Starwood main reservation line and after basically a half hour of being placed on hold and the run around, I was placed in another nearby Sheraton. I was therefore displaced from the hotel where my conference was and had to find my own transportation to the conference. This inconvenience is only magnified due to my overall dissatisfaction with the service (actually lack of) that the hotel staff here provided. To top it off, there is no WiFi in the rooms and to get internet is through an ethernet cable which is $12 per 24 hours and I got overcharged for using the in-room food bar. The rooms themselves are nice. I was in the Bay tower. In-room coffee maker, flat panel TV, The whole complex is huge and there is a free shuttle from the airport to the main Marina tower and between the 2 towers. The airport shuttle runs every 25 minutes which is an eternity when you have just come off a long flight. Basically one person's bad experience..would not recommend or recommend this hotel. Each guests experience is different. Mine just happened to be bad.

<Title>“Great Resort Like Property”
<Content>This property is beautifully maintained! From the outdoor grounds to the club floor, everything was clean and looked fresh. The hotel is broken up into two buildings. The Marina Tower being the "main" tower with restaurants, pools, gym, tennis courts, Starbucks and club lounge. The Bay Tower is about a 5 minute walk along the marina and while not a huge deal it would be a little inconvenient if you were wanting to be close to the action of the hotel. The property sits on the marina and across the street from the airport, BUT this is not a typical airport hotel !! It is somewhere between hotel and resort property probably partly because of the expansive grounds and being on the marina. The rooms in the Marina tower are a tad on the smaller side, but have balconies and in excellent condition. Rooms in the Bay tower are a bit larger. The higher floors have wonderful views no matter which building you are in or which direction you are facing. Even the lower floors I imagine would have nice views as there is nothing around the immediate property but marina or bay. Full Starbucks in the lobby is very convenient for morning nibbles or whatever coffee concoction you like best. There is also a full service restaurant with a very nice breakfast buffet. Equally enjoying is the club lounge on the top floors which is a wonderful place to relax and watch the sunrise over breakfast or the sunset over appetizers and drinks. The front desk agents we encountered were very friendly and helpful, even when we asked to check in at 9am. Although a room wasn't immediately available, it was shortly thereafter and well before the normal afternoon hotel check in time. The restaurant waiter we had was also very attentive and friendly. And I have to give a big thanks to the club lounge waiter who was equally attentive.

<Title>“Great location for an active family”
<Content>We booked this hotel through Hotwire and never know what kind of room our Hotwire rate will buy so we were THRILLED when the front desk staff accommodated our request for a bay view room on a top floor! Â In the morning we watched dolphins swim casually back and front from our balcony. Â (Note: there are two distinct hotels and we actually prefer the Bayview tower. Â You can choose either a view of the bay or view of the marina from this tower. We've had both and you can't go wrong either way). I loved the way the bed was angled to face the water. Â What a great view from the bed! Â  Right out the side door of the Bayview Tower is a sweet little deli, Papanani's, Â that serves nice cook to order breakfast that you can call ahead and order, take-out back to your room, or eat right on the marina. Highly recommend it. Â  The hotel rent bikes (though we brought our own) and its a lovely little bike ride along the water to downtown. Our kids are 9 and 6 and were thrilled by the ships we passed on our bike ride (pirate ships/aircraft carriers) and we even got to stop and watch a habor seal put on a show for us while it chased a school of circling fish! Â What fun! Â I cannot say enough about the great staff that work here. We forgot our kids' helmets and they were so kind in letting us borrow some for free and even replaced a bolt we'd lost off my bike. Â We biked over to Liberty Park too which is an awesome kids park: Â tons of grass and multiple play areas!!! In the past we have also biked to Balboa Park/zoo from this hotel. Â Did I mention we had awesome service from everyone we encountered which really makes a difference to me. The workout room was very nice! Â We only swam in the Marina Tower pool and it was nice. The hottub was big! The room was nice and big too. Â The only negative was I didn't have hot water for my late morning shower. It was only warm. Overall an excellent stay.Â

<Content>We loved this place, the staff was very friendly, made you feel special and they gave us an upgrade without having to ask at all. Also included a Welome drink of your choice in the bar! Just a great Welcome experience. Our room overlooked the Bay and it was quite spectacular both by day and night. The hotel offers a nice fitness center and swimming pool areas with Hot tub. Our room was very comfortable, plenty of room to relax. All in all I would love to stay again and hopefully will. Great getaway weekend.

<Title>“Great Sheraton Airport Property-stay without hesitations”
<Content>Stayed at this property for one night with my wife and two small kids. We booked connecting rooms and paid for the upgrade to the Club Level Floor. Airport Shuttle was waiting for us, with a very helpful and pleasant driver. Shuttle runs to and from airport every 15 minutes. Check in was flawless, quick and painless. Our club level connecting rooms in the Marina tower were great for our family. Typical Sheraton rooms and exactly what we expected. One bonus are that the rooms come with a balcony. Our rooms overlooked the Marina and we really enjoyed looking at the boats and people watching from the balcony. We used the main pool just below the restaurant. It wasn't too warm that day outside (60 ish) so actually my kids used the pool while we sat and watched. We ordered room service delivered to the pool deck and it arrived quickly and was quite tasty. As mentioned in other rooms, food and beverage are pretty expensive, and there are not any other options within walking distance, so plan ahead. The upgrade to the club floor was worth it for the appetizers in the evening and the nice breakfast spread in the morning. Only downer is that this Club level does not offer complementary adult beverages, but rather a cash bar. I was hoping the cash bar prices would be a bit less than the regular bar, but they were still on the expensive side. With that being said the staff working in the Club Lounge were great. We enjoyed our time in the lounge. Took a cab into San Diego proper for a few hours....15 bucks each way, so reasonable if you are not wanting to rent a car. I would highly recommend this airport property if you have a lay over or early flight. It was a great station for us to stay at for the night. One other note, we were not bothered by airport noise, but our room faced the Marina and not the airport. Stay here without hesitations. This is a nice property with an excellent staff.

<Title>“Very nice hotel”
<Content>The hotel is nice and we loved the view of the marina. The outdoor fire pits are relaxing to sit by. The only downfall is that the parking lot was usually full, so we had to walk a little distance. They did let us check in 3 hours early. The location near the airport is nice and the planes didn't bother us. The beds were comfortable. We will be back.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel!!!!”
<Content>The hotel was extremely clean. The entire staff was polite and courteous. Our room had lots of chrome fixtures and there wasn't one fingerprint or smudge anywhere. The view of the bay was great. We usually stay at the Radisson for the sleepnumber beds, but this was better than I thought it would be and the bed was very comfortable. We will be back.

<Title>“Cute room, GREAT view.”
<Content>I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews on this site but I have to say our one night stay was FANTASTIC! Our room was facing the marina and the sunset on the patio was BREATHTAKING. Our room was 2 queen beds and left very little room for extra bags or stretching room but we made do. The room itself was very clean and had very nice furnishings. Some have mentioned the proximity to the airport, the only time I noticed this was when I was in the hot tub and I could hear planes fly over, when I was in my room I never would have known I was near it. The grounds a beautiful and the staff was very attentive, they even let us check in 3 hours early. The one thing I would like to mention is Nicholas in lost and found. He saved me BIG TIME. I am from Alaska and I somehow left my big winter parka in my room. I had a flight out the next day and called frantically to the hotel, even though it was after hours Sue transferred me to his extension telling me to leave a message and she would contact him directly letting him know I needed assistance ASAP. Sure enough within minutes of leaving a message I received a call back. They had my coat and would be able to FedEx it to me in the morning. He went above and beyond standard customer service.

<Title>“Spectacular”
<Content>My husband took me here on our anniversary in may 2011. I live on the east coast and I was amazed to what we experienced. I loved our room, the staff was out of this world, and the best part was the airport was right across the street. I would most definitely come back again.

<Title>“Disappointing Stay”
<Content>When I checked into the Sheraton it didn't help that I had to wait 20 minutes. I was asked at check in if I would be a "green" patron. I asked what that meant and it was that housekeeping would not change out my towels and that they would leave me a voucher for the restaurant / bar for $5. I stayed 4 nights and what it meant was that housekeeping didn't come at all to empty the trash or make the bed. Also, these $5 vouchers could not be combines to go towards an overall meal, making you either use them for drinks at the bar. On top of that I was slapped with a $22 / night charge for self parking (most likely because of the marina). Outside of these comments, the hotel was nice and clean and the service was okay. If you don't have a car, it's a reasonable place to stay, otherwise, I'd suggest that you find another hotel in the San Diego area.

<Title>“Good for me”
<Content>I went to San Diego for a conference at the convention center and stayed at this hotel for four nights through hotwire. As a huge fan of public transportation and walking, I tried to walk. It is 3 miles one way and it ook me a full one hour, so I stopped doing this after a day. You can hop in the free airport shuttle and take mts992, which costs only $2.25 and just a few minutes to downtown, although you need to walk additional few blocks to the convention center. Upon the recommendation from this site, I requested a room with a downtown view, and the staff gave me a room at Bay Tower (about 1000 ft from Marina Tower). I found out that I could not see the downtown. The next day, I requested a room to Marina Tower to be near the airport shuttle without any preference to the view, and I was given a room with a beautiful downtown view. From the experience of staying at both towers, the room at Marina Tower was smaller and was okay since I was alone, and I presume that even numbered room at Marina Tower: harbor/airport view odd numbered room at Marina Tower: downtown view even numbered room at Bay Tower: airport view odd numbered room at Bay Tower: harbor view. The staff were very nice. I did not have the privilege of using free wifi in the room, but I saw people with status get it. There are a few computers in the lobby and the connectivity was good. I have no particular complaint against the hotel and I would stay again.

<Title>“Ok place to stay”
<Content>The hotel is in a wonderful location but the hotel and rooms need to be updated. The rooms have some wear that is visible but the rooms are comfortable. I have stayed there twice and found some staff to be very helpful and others not so much. I would recommend the hotel as long as you go on Priceline or Hotwire and get a good price.

<Title>“Tired Facility”
<Content>Positives: -Airport Access -Marina Location -Lobby Free Internet Access -Balconies on rooms with chairs -Comfortable bed Negatives: -Run down room -Run down airport shuttle -Expensive (overpriced) on-site dining I got a really good rate at this facility, but upon check-in and seeing my room I quickly checked availability at other options. Seeing as how I was only destined to sleep a few hours over two nights at this hotel, I elected to stay. The rooms were outdated, especially the bathroom. Lights above the mirror were about 5'8" high, which wasn't conducive to a slightly taller person who has to shave. Fixtures were rusty, shower curtain was too long (about 4" on the bath floor, inside the bath), and the sink was once-overed with crud collecting against the wall below the mirror. It was pretty much unacceptable and if I had arrived at a decent time or normal state of mind I would have definitely requested a room change. The on-site dining charged resort rates for food, which I feel based on the overall condition of things is overpriced. I did not order any of the food. At one time this may have been a 4 star facility, I would now rate it a 3 star facility operating at about 2.5 stars overall. The staff was overall friendly and helpful, although upon arrival it was like pulling teeth to ask for a king instead of the two twins they had me booked in. He tried not to change me, but in a courteous and professional manner. I would not stay at this hotel again, however I think it is a fair value at a 3 star rate for a big hotel.

<Title>“Not as good as they could be.”
<Content>I reserved and paid in advance for a room with a King bed, but was given a room with two doubles or queens. I reported this to the front desk and was told there were no King rooms left. This always confuses me. If I reserve it and PAY for it, why don't I get it. As I was only in for one night, I let it go. The room itself was good sized and the bathroom was clean. The hotel is not as close to things as the website suggests, or at least they take longer than you would assume by the given distances posted. Nothing is within walking distance. The parking is pretty expensive at $22/ day self, $30/ valet. If you self park, be ready for a hike back to the lobby. The price per night at $119 was reasonable for the room, but there are additional taxes and parking fees that took my final bill to over $155. If you are there for an overnight stay between flights and don't have a car and plan to stay in, the hotel is in a good spot. If you plan to visit downtown or the Gaslamp area, bring plenty of cash as a taxi will run $30-$50 round trip.

<Title>“Good marina location”
<Content>I am ambivalent about this hotel, mainly because of the service. Aside from the pleasant gym attendant and waitstaff in the restaurants, the other employees were less effective than automated voice response units. They did get their jobs done, but offered nothing without prompting. Otherwise I enjoyed the marina location. It's a nice area for walking and the pool was great. The marina tower room was fine. The club breakfast had a good selection of items. This is a good option if you're arriving on a late flight and just want to jump on a quick shuttle to your room. By the way, I didn't hear a single plane during my stay. A helicopter once while outside, but otherwise no excess noise at all.

<Title>“Excellent experience, even when they were challenged by the San Diego blackout.”
<Content>I cannot say enough good about the Sheraton Marina Bay in San Diego. We were there for the graduation of my son from USMC boot camp, and the lights went out all over the entire city that afternoon. Literally, no one had power. We were there with our younger children, and I had so many concerns over where we would feed them, if we would even be able to check into the hotel, etc. The temperature that day was around 100 degrees. Well, we got to the Sheraton, and the line to check in was long because they only had 2 computers working off generators and all these people were trying to check in whose flights had been cancelled (it's right by the airport). The staff were walking around handing out water bottles to all of us and light sticks because there was no power in the rooms. The cold water was such a blessing and I just thought the light sticks were such a nice thing to do. Then, if you can believe it, they had a cold buffet set up in the dining area that evening that had cold cuts, cheeses, pasta salad, green salad, etc. I was so relieved to know my kids would get to eat! They had very few lights on, but the servers were friendly despite the circumstances they were working in, and the presentation offered was amazing considering they only had a short time to put this together and make sure their guests could have something to eat. I felt taken care of. Really. Of course the rooms had no lights, but it was clean and comfortable. The sun had gone down and we had a nice breeze from the bay through our balcony's sliding glass door, so it actually was cool in our room by the time we went to bed. The power came back on around midnight thankfully. In summary, as a mom being away from home in a city I didn't know with no power, with my young children, I can't say enough about how well taken care of I felt by the Sheraton. I felt safe and was just so pleased with how gracious all the staff was under such duress themselves.

<Title>“Thanks Mr. Casanova and Sheraton”
<Content>Stayed recently at the Sheraton Marina in San Diego for a conference. Pleasant place to stay. Good conference facilities. Nice amenities, place to walk. But what really left me feeling good about the place is this: In a hurry to catch my plane after the conference, I left behind a dresser drawer full of clothing. Because of my schedule, it was more than a week before I realized where I had left it. When I called, Mr. Nicolas Casanova from Lost & Found tracked my clothes down for me and returned them to me intact. Way to go Sheraton. I won't forget it.

Fun to enjoy the coll morning temps with coffee in hand. The staff is friendly and the rooms are large and clean...always a bonus for us traveling with 2 teens! This hotel location is perfect! Close to lots of restaurants, downtown etc.

<Title>“Great Stay!”
<Content>I wasn't expecting much since it was a hotel near the airport, but the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina is a great place to stay! The hotel is beautiful--has a nice pool, jacuzzi, and fire pits right by the harbor. The views from the room were nice as well. The room was clean and stylish. We could hear the airplanes taking off every once in a while from the airport, but it didn't bother me a bit (and I'm an extremely light sleeper). Upon our arrival, the valet were very helpful and answered our questions about where to park. Susanna from In Room Dinning was so nice when she brought our breakfast up the next morning! (The front desk had forgotten to give us our F&B discount card upon arrival and she said no problem she would take care of it and she made sure the bill was adjusted). The concierge (can't remember her name, but she had brown hair) was really helpful as well and printed off directions to five different places for us. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Sheraton is a dream!”
<Content>I couldn't be more impressed with the Sheraton Hotel & Marina. The location-very near-the airport-is wonderful..right on the water and convenient to everything. The staff goes out of their way for their guests, the rooms are beautiful and there is great food and service at Tapatinis--just off the lobby. After a slight mix-up with my room, the GM called to make sure everything was taken care of. I travel to San Diego often and will not stay anywhere else!

<Title>“Recent conference stay unfortunate”
<Content>I attended a conference there recently. The conference was in the main tower, even though I had a reservation there, I was put in the Bay tower (an old Westin) that is located at a separate location. I am not sure how far it is, but it was a very long way back and forth in the rain. I ended up spending almost 3 hours waiting for the shuttle (supposed to be every 20 minutes) during the 2 days. One evening it was raining and i waited for 40 minutes. No wireless internet in the room. It did have wired that i didn't use. One hour limited wireless in the lobby. My spouse tried to eat there one evening and couldn't even get anyone to seat her. If you have to be there for a conference -think twice about accepting a Bay tower room. You are somewhat isolated at this property. Not much close by. I would not stay there for a vacation without a vehicle. The main hotel looked nice when i walked through the lobby to attend meetings. The food at our conference was average. One evening we had a dinner for 250. The food was cold. Not warm, cold.

<Title>“Beautiful view of harbor, convenient location”
<Content>Beautiful view and experience of the San Diego harbor. Hotel accommodations were very good. Rooms were well appointed, very clean and tastefully decorated. All the employees we came in contact with were very friendly and helpful. Had an issue with the heating in the room but maintenance came quickly and fixed the problem. Were disappointed that the suite we had reserved was not the room that was given to us. Since we were there for a week, a separate living/bedroom area would have served our needs better. Lunch in the bar was very good - had the marinated skirt steak sandwich. Room was exceptionally quiet for the entire week until the last night when people above us created a lot of noise, stomping, jumping, etc. Bed linens were luxurious, however the mattress was so extremely soft that we had backaches all week. No support at all. Spa experience (facial) was very enjoyable. Ask for Mary Ann. She was great.

<Content>I visit every year for a conference. The experience is almost always excellent. This time was no different. The rooms are sparkling clean and well-stocked. The restaurant and bar are lively and serve great food. Their meeting facilities are outstanding. The proximity to the airport makes this a very convenient hotel. The distance from the city center means you always have to cab it there rather than take a leisurely stroll.

<Title>“Good Conference Location”
<Content>There's many things I like about this property. There are a few negatives. Positives First: - Love the location, close to airport but with a harbor/bay view - My room (on 12 floor) had a balcony facing the water which was very nice. - Club lounge on the 13 or 14 floor is very decent. The evening snacks are great and tasty. Examples include fried chicken. The breakfast spread is adequate. Bagels, eggs, oatmeal, fruits, small selection of ham and cheese, juices, tea/coffee. No hot breakfast. The views are phenomenal. The sitting is comfy. - The rooms facing the bay (ie. with the view are great) - Its a very short drive to the Gas Lamp Quarter; maybe 7 minutes or less. Its literally two minutes to the airport. - Rooms are not luxurious but very comfortable. Decor is reasonable, in blue. Negatives - the hotel does not have good restaurants. The restaurants share one kitchen, and depending on your luck, the wait and service for food can range from 5 to 25 minutes. Its a big drawback. Having said that, the service, when you do get it, is reasonable. The waitstaff try very hard to please. The fitness center is reasonable with a wide range of equipment. There are decent pools, but I didn't get to use them. All in all, I would stay again, as long as I am not counting to eat at their restaurants. There is a starbucks at the property.

<Title>“Average Airport hotel”
<Content>Sheraton is in fact two hotels, the Sheraton and Bay Towers some 600 yards around the corner. Similar to previous reviewer, after having parked my car and gone to reception, I had to drive around to the Bay Hotel to my room. Hotel is in a great position, close to the airport next to the water. Bars are quiet as was the restaurant. Be warned however, a quick visit to the Gaslamp District will cost you @18 USD one way if you want to party. Otherwise, the Sheraton provides all the usual amenities, nothing special.

<Title>“A reasonable airport hotel”
<Content>Convenient for the airport, though plane noise is not too noticeable in the guest rooms. Clean room, if in need of renovation (though the check in staff implied it had been recently renovated). Definitely worth staying in the main tower. If you want more than a standard airport hotel, this is not for you. The restaurant was the disappointment. The staff wearing badly coffee stained shirts, the food average, with little attention to detail (e.g. The soup comes with biscuits still in plastic packets) yet relatively high priced. Few alternative options in the area.

<Title>“Convenient to the airport, but won't select for a stay in the city.”
<Content>My expectations were not too high. I selected this hotel because it was convenient to the airport. I had stayed at this hotel many years ago for a large conference. I was pleased to have an upgrade into an executive suite as an SPG Platinum member. As is typical of large hotels, it was a long walk to the room. The room was old but had been updated to meet Sheraton standards. The club floor lounge was very large. The food was limited. The staff in the club lounge was very attentive.

We had a room overlooking the marina and the sunset from the balcony was fantastic after a busy day seeing the sights. Staff were lovely and helpful, rooms were nicely furnished and close to the airport. We had a car so found it easy to drive around from the location. We didnt eat at the resort but enjoyed heading into the Gaslamp District as there was so much on offer.

<Content>Be sure to enquire which hotel your room is in as I called hotel in advance, was not forewarned by staff, parked car, offloaded luggage, walked from far end of parking lot only to be told I was in Bay Tower...which is essentially another hotel 600 yards or more away. Had the front desk person told me when I called and she knew I was driving over I would have avoided a needless exercise. Hotel fairly basic Sheraton. Saw various people speaking to staff during visit with service issues. Next time will try Hilton which is next to Bay Tower.

<Title>“Great Conference Hotel”
<Content>I stayed here for 3 nights during s conference - stayed in the Marina tower. The bed was very comfortable and I had 3 great nights of sleep which is highly unusual for me. I loved the city/bay view and I never closed the drapes . The sunsets and sunrises were amazing. What impressed me the most was the staff. Every single persons greeted me sincerely - from the front desk to the maid on the 11th floor, to the wait staff during the conference luncheon to the guys packing up the conference chairs . The customer service training at this to hotel really shows - but the sincerity was amazing. The employees honestly seem happy to work here - every single one. Room for improvement: better transportation downtown for those of us who didn't bring a car. The city bus stop was way too far away and there wasn't enough info for us to figure how how to get to downtown ourselves. This hotel will feel isolated for those who like to walk to restaurants etc.

<Title>“Disgusted by the "Green" Treatment”
<Content>I stayed here with my husband for a conference, and while the hotel was pleasant I was unhappy with several features, especially the "green" housekeeping option. When I signed up I understood we were just foregoing having our sheets and towels changed daily, but instead we discovered we received NO housekeeping services whatsoever -- including replenishment of our in-room coffee and shampoo. I also was surprised that despite our reservations far in advance, we were assigned a room literally in the basement. We had a nice little patio with a couple of chairs, but the view was of a wall below the parking lot. The day of our departure I received an email offering me a view for an additional substantial daily charge (which I declined), and then found that other people at the conference enjoyed lovely views at no additional cost. There's also no wi-fi in the rooms -- and hard-wire Internet costs about $12 a day. Finally, access to the hotel is poor without a car. Even the Old Town Trolley comes by only once in the morning and once in the evening. There must be better deals in San Diego, and if I were not attending a conference there I'd certainly find them.

<Title>“Fabulous hotel, space, value & service”
<Content>Stayed 2 nights pre-cruise with a group of 70 at this hotel. Whole group thrilled with hotel. Service in restaurant superb. Ronnie Hophman (Food & Beverage Manager) was very professional and helpful. Brian, waiter, went out of his way to be cheerful and went teh extra mile to do things for us. Alex, another waiter, leaped out of nowhere to help when my husband choked (badly) on his coffee. He was fabulous. Front desk staff very good. Rooms spacious and lovely. Beds VERY comfortabel. I slept 10 hrs!!! Turn right out of hotel, go to water. Turn left and walk a ways. YOu will come to Island Prime, a restaurant that has Happy Hour prices and $5.00 appetizers (REALLY good) 3.30-5.30 pm. A lovely walk along the water. San Diego is lovely. Must go to zoo also.

<Title>“rather good hotel but needs improvement”
<Content>rinStayed there 4 nights and wanted to combine business and pleasure. Asked the receptionist to put me in the room with better water view and she did the opposite - I had to drive 7 minutes to Bay Tower and got the room with view on PARKING and road (and the bay is somewhere far!) Next morning I had to move to Marina Tower. That's first time I see the hotel where You need to DRIVE between towers . Parking is open air but cost 22USD (self). Marina Tower (Main) was rather good, they have nice restaurant and free internet in the Lobby.

<Title>“Great location near the water”
<Content>So close to the airport without the feel of an "airport hotel". Stayed in the Marina tower and loved the nautical decor. Walk along the harbor right outside and in fact spotted dolphins swimming in the harbor on our walk over to the Starbucks in the Harbor tower. Pool at the Marina tower was small but nice.

<Title>“Nice Hotel, Location Worked for Us. $22 Parking.”
<Content>We spent a week at this hotel in late Jan. I was very concerned about the location prior to arrival due to the proximity to the airport, however, it turned out to be a great location for us. Rent a car and you will be central to everything San Diego has to offer. Going down town to eat got old quickly due to traffic and crowds and we found ourselves spending more and more time in the Point Loma, an area just north of the hotel. The whirlpool was very nice and big, 10 people can comfortably fit. The room was nicely decorated and the beds were comfortable. It's not a Westin heavenly bed but it is far from the low end. There is airport noise but it's mostly during the day when we were away so it's not an issue. Our room was overlooking the marina (away from the airport) so the other side might be different. $22/day parking is very high and you have no viable alternative. It was interesting that long term airport parking in the area was $10/day. My one complaint is the price of parking. Seems very excessive and should be included in room rates. Internet was only free in the lobby. The 4 lobby computers were in good condition and provided fast access. We checked weather and "sites to see" in the lobby prior to leaving for the day. Overall we had a great stay and would consider this hotel if returned to the San Diego area.

<Title>“Great for short stays or if you have a rental car”
<Content>The Sheraton near SAN provides a nice play to rest for short trips in the area. While there are not many restaurants/services in the surrounding vicinity, the hotel provides several options including a gift shop and two restaurants with overpriced, but decent food. The breakfast buffet - while limited in choices - had a nice sampling of fresh fruit. We enjoyed playing ping-pong in the recreation area and found the pool and hot tub to be a perfect end to the day. We also loved our time by the fire pit, finding it especially satisfying after a dip. The room itself was nicely appointed and very comfortable. Service was excellent and the free shuttle bus to the airport prompt and convenient. Stay here for short trips and when you need a good base for jumping off into the San Diego area.

<Content>Spectacular views of the bay, great big room with plenty of space to relax and chill. loved sitting on the balcony looking at the ships go by within feet of the hotel! Marina hotel very luxerious with outstanding breakfast. Service very friendly and extremley attentive. Free internet with easy accessibility to it. Parking fees a little expensive but its worth it to have a car. Literally minutes from the airport which sounds daunting and looks daunting but is well placed and not noisy at all, not sure how they do it! Spent 5 fab days there and loved every minute! will definatly go back.

<Title>“Great Escape”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here while on a trip out west. Fantastic location,and amazing views of the harbor and of the Naval base across the way. Durning the afternoons you could see the helicopters performing manuvers and all kinds of fun stuff. It's a short cab ride into the city, we always hit the Gaslamp when we go and this time we caught a Padres game too. If you have a little bit of time also check out Old Town for some amazing food and drinks and then head over to Coronado to check out the hotel and go to McP's pub for a few drinks. McP's is incredible, SEAL and miltiary memorabilia all over the place, as this is a favorite hangout of the locals from the base we're told.

<Title>“Nice hotel, good location, friendly staff”
<Content>Spent 3 days here for a convention. We took the complimentary shuttle from the airport & they set a great first impression for the hotel; very friendly, gave us lots of tips on where to visit while we were in town. Smooth, friendly check in. They have a bar & grill type place, restaurant & a Starbucks. I took advantage of them all but would stay stick to drinks at the bar. The food was low quality, like a mom was back there showing her 8 year old how to cook. Clean, spacious rooms, really comfy bed & pillows - but request a higher floor. We were in what I would call the basment - it was the floor below the entrance. Balconies in all rooms & that's a plus.

However, my experience here has been far above anywhere I have stayed and I look forward to each stay. I actually sleep well and enjoy my room, and truly enjoy the views from my window!

<Content>The hotel looks it is trying to be a luxury hotel but the towels were small and not very thick. As others have said, you must take a cab everywhere. It is the hotel Holland America uses but I'm not sure why when there is a Holiday Inn half a block from the cruise terminal.

<Title>“Great view, dirty and cold room”
<Content>We only stayed at this hotel for one night because we were visiting Sea World the next day. It is very close to Sea World and close to lots of fun areas and the view is wonderful. The room itself needed a little bit of TLC. There was lipstick on the window because someone had kissed it and there was mold in the shower grout. There was also hair on the floor. It didn't have a central heating system- only a wall unit and the wall unit was filthy and didn't work very well. We called the front desk and they didn't seem too concerned with fixing it. We waited 30 mins for someone to show up and eventually just gave up and went to bed. In the middle of the night the smoke detector started beeping because the battery was low. So that was fun too. :)

<Content>I have stayed at many Sheraton's in the U.S. and this one is tops in my opinion. Nicely located on the marina with great views. Close to the airport so perfect for business travelers. A bit of noise from the airplanes depending on where you are located within the hotel but that is expected. Upgraded always as a Platinum member which is really nice. Main restaurant is very nice. Sports bar is good for a casual dinner and to catch the game.

<Title>“Comfortable But Noisy”
<Content>THE GOOD Customer service at the Bay Tower was fantastic; we arrived a few hours before scheduled check-in but were allowed to check-in early. Front desk staff was very nice and accommodating. Harbor view was beautiful and the room was clean and comfortable with a nautical theme. The bathroom was a bit disappointingâ€”it looked tired like a bathroom from a 1980s family home. Still, it was manageable and everything worked fine. THE NOT-SO-GOOD Only two major complaints about the Bay Tower: the location and the noise. I booked on Priceline thinking it would be closer to Gaslamp; *technically* we could have walked there, but it would have been quite a hike. Since we didn't have a rental car (and didn't want to pay for a taxi), our exploration radius was very limited. And since we were in our room much of the time, we noticed that it was quite noisy. You could hear every sound from the hallway from quiet conversations to people dragging in from the clubs at 2-3am. And since we were there over New Year's Eve, we also heard several boisterous groups until around 4am. Unrelated: could not access free wi-fi. Decent stay overall, but probably would not stay again.

<Title>“This is an airport Hotel”
<Content>Please don't get me wrong, but this airport Hotel is just that. Simply put, it is a good choice if you are having to spend the night before catching a flight or arriving a day before a cruise and nedd a place to stay overnight. There are much better choices for spending longer in San Diego,, especially if you don't want to have to rent a car. It is located near San Diego Airport but just a bit too far from the Gas Lamp district to hoof it on foot. This about a caution about location rather than the hotel itself.

<Title>“A Perfect Stay”
<Content>We stayed here for one night before an early flight. We chose this hotel because it was close to the airport. For an airport hotel, it does not seem like one at all. The hotel is really beautiful, warm and welcoming. The staff at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful. We checked in early and received a room upgrade since we are Starwood Gold Members. The suite was spacious, new and comfortable. It had a King bed and a Queen size pull out sofa, plus a full size bar and two balconies facing the marina. The bedding was perfect. The bathroom and room were updated. The pool was heated and the jacuzzi was nice. The restaurant has good food and not too pricey. We ended up taking a later flight and we had complementary late check-out at 4:00pm because we are Starwood gold members. There is also a complementary airport shuttle that runs every 15 minutes. Overall, it was a great experience.

<Title>“San Diego Bay”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel Christmas Eve while visiting the Rock church and the Zoo. Just a few minutes drive from the Zoo. I booked the room on a last minute deal and got the room for 1/2 price. This is a fantastic place! We choose a Bay view rm. It had an awesome view of the city and was spectacular at night. Our rm. was also awesome, with a balcony overlooking the Bay and city. We were able to leave the slider open at night. Bath rm. was exceptional and the bed was perfect for a good night sleep. They also provided a coffee maker with starbucks coffee, (not often seen in a hotel rm.) They also have a Starbuck in the lobby,(I didn't have to drive for my morning fix!) The only negitive was the parking lot. Paid $10 per day and had to walk past the paved lot to a gravel lot way to the rear of the building. Sort of what you might expect at a truck stop! I left only because of the loudness of the airport and the smell of jet fuel in the morning.

Housekeeping was top notch. Great hotel on the water and within a half a mile of the airport. The planes can be loud but the sight of them taking off and landing so closely was a fun aspect of our stay. Top notch exercise equipment in 24 hour gym. Self park was $22 a day but easy. We'd very likely stay here again. Nice, large waterfront pool as well.

<Title>“Nice Hotel, but its Restaurants are Crap”
<Content>Stayed here for five days for a conference. Beautiful location, albeit it's a bit out of the way. Fabulous pool in the bigger building. I stayed in their smaller (and newly acquired) building and was glad -- the other building was nicer, but it was a lot larger and a LOT louder. The restaurants... are crap. No, that's too nice; disgusting is the right word. And the outragous price just ads insult to injury. I ate in all of them (both buildings) except the fancy one. Even breakfast was gross. How do you mess up breakfast? The in-room coffee was better than the restaurant coffee. WTH? Are they trying to get you to go to their Starbucks instead? Value and rating downgraded because of the restaurants. For the love of food, do NOT eat at their restaurants. Go down the island to C Level; it's prices are better, and the food is worlds beyond better.

<Title>“NO HOT WATER, INTERNET BROKEN, WACKY A/C”
<Content>I am not one of those hotel guests that ever complains about a hotel, and I stay in about 30 nights a year. However, I feel compelled to write about my recent stay at this hotel. I never had an unplesant experience at a hotel ever. It all started the day after I checked in. That morning I had NO hot water. None whatsoever, not even warm or room temperature water, just COLD water. I took a nice cold shower! Then I went to the front desk and I got moved to a new room on the 6th floor. I was staying in the Bay tower. Then the water in the new room was not working either.I was then moved AGAIN to a new room, finally to room 697. Finally I got working hot water. The mechanic said the entire wing of rooms on the 6th floor lost hot water due to the line going into most of the rooms. The first night during my stay I couldn't sleep at all, The A/C in the room kept turning off when the room temperature reached 65. It's hard for me to sleep in complete silence! I need the A/C to stay on! I never experienced a hotel's A/C system that doesn't let the customer keep the thing ON! The next day I had to call a mechanic, and he eventually performed some "super duper" A/C thermostat tricks and found a way to put the system to 60. and it stayed ON and cold, finally! Why this hotel doesn't let guests have this simple ability is beyond me. The fun doesn't stop here, the next night in my stay I couldn't get the internet to work on my computer. I called tech support. The mechanic had to come to my room and replace not just the cable cord, but the modem to! Who knows why, but after they replaced all of the defective equipment I finally got online. However this hotel is special! You get to choose 2 speeds! One is the regular speed at like $11, and other is an absurd price of $20 (high speed). I opted for the regular speed and took a chance. BIG MISTAKE! The speed has been the slowest speed of ANY hotel I have every stayed at! It was slow, almost like dialup internet access slow. It was probably like DSL or slower. It was sad. It was so sloooow I got so frustrated I turned my Android phone into a mobile hotspot, and guess what my Tmobile data speed was much faster than the hotel's internet speed, This hotel needs just to offer one speed, and get rid of their slow speed. However with all of the negative experiences I had at this place there were some positives to note: PLUSES: Room services, it was pretty tasty and I enjoyed the shrimp cocktail, and spicy buffalo wings. However, the chicken tenders tasted like cardboard, it was horrible. View: it's gorgeous. I felt so relaxed and peaceful here. And I enjoyed watching the christmas boat light parade as well. Room itself and bed: the bed was pretty comfy, and the room was appointed nice. I used the mini bar a lot, and thought it was convinient even though it is pricey. Anyways I am rating my stay only 2 stars because the negatives of my experience far outweighted the positives. I hope this hotel fixed their hot water issues, and also please fix your ridicolous internet speeds and only offer 1 speed. And let guests FULLY control their A/C. Thank you.

<Title>“Much better than the reviews.... Good business/meeting hotel”
<Content>I was staying at the Sheraton Marina hotel on business as I had to attend some global company meetings there so I did not have much choice on the location however I did want to make sure I had the right room (following the reviews of this site). I can confirm that I stayed in the Marina Tower (which is the main hotel where the Spa and Starbucks are) on the 11th floor in a delux room and it was perfect for one. The room was a little on the small side but I had a kingbed and the room was well equiped with all the normal extras including a Starbuck coffee machine. Check in was efficient (unfortunately check out was slow with what appeared to be a trainee...). Used the spa a couple of times (early in the morning) and had massages with Gary who was great! Meeting room facilities were good and the catering for the meeting was above average. Overall a great business hotel (apart from lack of wifi in the room...)

<Title>“Sheraton plus”
<Content>The check in was lovely. Arriving by the airport shuttle was a fantastic surprise (we had not asked at the time of booking - while at the airport we seen the 'sheraton' labelled shuttle free YES) lovely. The hotel lobby was so nice and open and fresh. The lady at the desk was wonderful. Really polite, and offered tips on our stay - what we were doing and went out of her way to help us with our check in. When I asked about allergies and restaurants, this lady went out of her way to provide us with the most accurate answer possible. Further since we were on our anniversary, and booking in early (which was some 5 hours earlier due to an earlier flight than expected) this lady checked and re-checked to give us a lovely king bed room (not queen) :)- it was appreciated. The staff overall were fantastic - the layout of the hotel was lovely. Would stay again

<Title>“Nice Hotel; Great Location”
<Content>This is a nice hotel, five minutes from the airport, with clean, large and comfortable rooms. The location is between the marinas and the bay with great views from every room. A group of three guys stayed there for the weekend that the America's Cup 45's were racing in San Diego bay. They were very accommodating and gave us a room on the eighth floor, overlooking the bay so we could watch the races from the balcony. There was plenty of room for the rollaway bed they provided free of charge. We had breakfast in the very nice restaurant down stairs, and while it was $20, the food and service was good.

<Title>“Location, views, conference facilities, rooms, restaurants ...”
<Content>.. are all excellent. A small nit - I was disappointed that they still have no WiFi in guest rooms. The wire connection was OK but restrictive. Despite that limitation, I'd recommend the hotel to business and leisure travellers.

<Title>“Nice hotel, close to the airport, great service”
<Content>My partner and I stayed at the Bay Tower of this Sheraton over the week of Thanksgiving in 2011. The hotel is nice, has a lot of space, and is quiet. The rooms are basic but nice, including a couch and coffee table area to sit (Tip: The Bay Tower has larger rooms than those in the Marina Tower, which don't have the couch and extra space). The bathrooms need some updating: there's no fan and the sundries are generic. The views overlooking the marina are nice. The hotel is very close to the airport and is convenient for that reason. The service at the hotel was great. Anything we needed they brought immediately and were very accomodating. They unfortunately do not have cribs available if you're travelling with an infant, as we were, but that's a specific need. Overall, not a luxury hotel, but an affordable and decent place to stay.

<Title>“Lost and Found”
<Content>I left the hotel in a hurry and forgot to empty of the drawers. So I called the hotel and they connected me to the Lost and Found department. Nicolas who works in that department was very pleasant and helpful and arranged for my stuff to be delivered to my home 2 days later. I had to pay for the delivery but it was worth it.

<Title>“Excellent stay”
<Content>Stayed in a club room for 4 nights before catching a cruise home to Australia. I was very pleasantly surprised after reading various reviews. Views were superb and the hotel is angled so that great views of both the bay and the marina are available from various places on each floor. Good phot ops. Staff were very cooperative. I booked through expedia so got free internet and club access but we had trouble getting our key to access the club floor from the lift. It was all sorted out with the utmost courtesy. Room was clean, well equipped etc. No wifi in the rooms. Internet was wired which was a bother for my friend and her ipad. I'd certainly recommend paying for the club level. Breakfast was good and the evening crudites, dips, cheeses and hot dish meant we could have a big lunch and not pay for an evening meal. If you factor this in, the US$30 a day for valet parking is worth every cent.

<Title>“Got married here, they gave us a free room, called it a "suite"”
<Content>So there is nothing really WRONG with the individual pieces of this hotel at a glance.... The premises are nice, the rooms are clean, it's close to the airport. BUT, when you start adding it all up and looking at it as a total package, that's when the criticism comes in... I married my wife here in August 2011. Overall, I was very happy with their wedding packages. For only 105$ per person we got a great buffet dinner, 4 HOURS OF OPEN BAR (yay!) and someone who somewhat was a wedding coordinator. I really have no complaints about the wedding stuff. Everything went great, the staff were very helpfule with the setup. The only thing is that some stuff went missing, but that could have been our guests for all I know. Or an honest mistake, and could have gotten thrown away. The room they threw in was really two adjoining rooms and they just opened the door. Hardly a suite by any definition. They were nice rooms, but not a suite. If you get married here, make sure to dicuss that. The nice thing is that we ended up with a view of the bay. Either side of the hotel is not bad, pretty much all the views are good. Also, they charge for parking. If you are the bride and groom, you can get comped, but they will charge all of your guests, and parking is not cheap. If you get married here, they have some pretty good opportunities for photos. We took ours with the San Diego skyline in the background. If you are NOT getting married here then this hotel is ok if you are on business and have a car. Like I said, rooms are clean, etc, but there is not a coffee shop nearby, or a breakfast place, and room service is expensive. If you are in SD to have a good time, I'd suggest staying in Little Italy or the Gaslamp. The Gaslamp will be noisier, but is closer to fun bars/clubs. Little Italy is also fun, but a bit quieter, better for a family. This hotel is 3-5 miles from the Gaslamp and harbor tours, not great if you are here trying to see stuff. But if your goal is to be close to the airport, and you have no desire to leave the room, this hotel might be right for you. Even though room service is expensive, they have alternate options for dining close by. There are some restaurants on harbor island that are withing half mile to a mile away. Email me with questions, I know lots about this stuff!

<Title>“Fantastic vacation”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here as starwood members for five nights seeking romance, great location, and a beautiful hotel. This location was excellent right near the airport BUT we did not here the airplanes once. We were upgraded to the club core lounge and our room was on the top floor with an AMAZING view of the bay. Do not listen to the reviews below, this was a beautiful hotel, great location to see sites and right near the gas lamp district. We did some sight seeing to Disneyland (1.5 hour drive) and safari (45 minutes). The hotel is right near the zoo, balboa park, and sea world. I'd highly recommend a car. The hotel was incredibly clean, the staff was wonderful, especially the concierge who helped us plan day trips (thank-you Chantelle). We are 100% satisfied and so thankful for an amazing and romantic getaway!

<Title>“Room with a View”
<Content>This review if for the Bay Tower. The Bay Tower has it's own check in desk and it is located around the corner from the main towers. The rooms are fairly large for a standard room and my room had a large balcony facing the bay. It is located across from the airport but I didn't seem to notice the sounds of the planes. It's about a $12 taxi ride to the Gas Lamp District/Convention Center.

<Title>“Sheraton San Diego”
<Content>LOVED the Sheraton San Diego! Each room had a small balcony with two chairs and a table. Mine overlooked a marina and San Diego Bay! WONDERFUL! All the accommodations were great. Food was good, staff excellent. The conference rooms were neither too hot or too cold (first time ever in my experience) but were "just right". The doors to individual rooms did not SLAM every time someone came or went (but closed well) as in most places, and the curtains truly did keep out the light and the noise. I'd go back in a minute.

<Title>“Good location for business traveller”
<Content>It's simple - I travel in from the east coast for business on Sunday night, arriving at 10 p.m., take the shuttle to the hotel, in bed 45 minutes after landing. The next morning, Hertz, Avis and National are a quick walk from Marina Tower to pick up the rental car and drop off at the end of the trip (night before the flight to avoid the return hassle). It is in a great location to access Old Town, Downtown San Diego, north to the beaches, and the views are incredible. I have stayed in most of the Starwood properties in the region and for a business traveller, this is a most convenient location. The fitness facility has state of the art equipment, for me, an important part of business travel. I have even rented bikes when I have some down time, ridden downtown to the Broadway Pier and taken the ferry over to Coronado for a nice afternoon ride. All in all it has been a nice "base" when I am in San Diego.

<Title>“Ok, but not worth the price, and certainly not for leisure travelers”
<Content>Look, this place is nice, and the staff for the MOST part is friendly, HOWEVER, if you are not staying here for business, i recomend you do NOT stay Here. The biggest problem i had/AM HAVING, is PARKING. Okay, so in san diego, you can expect to pay for parking almost everywhere, including hotels with high rates like this place; im not going to hold that against them. What i WILL hold against them, is that on the third night i was here (today actually) we left to go to Sea World and to sight see, and came back exhausted, only to find out the side of the parking lot that we had been parking, at (WHICH WE HAD TO PAY FOR MIND YOU)was closed for some highly irritating event. we ended up having to park on the other side furthest from our room, and while the walk was not too horrible, it was not short either, and add to that being exhausted, and having to park in a crappy place after paying a fairly high amount for parking ($22 PER night), i was NOT happy. But what ensures that i will NOT stay here again, is that NOBODY SAID OR POSTED ANYTHING...ANYTHING about this event, and about that portion of the parking lot being closed. And if they did it must have been like a few minutes before the event. Certainly not the night before, not on their website, and no one at the front dest brought it to our attention, at any point. Had we been informed we would have at LEAST been ready to walk a bit and plan accordingly on our sightseeing trip. Add to that the parking staff outside taking an attitude of hostility to us when we inquired as to why we could not park where we had been, and why nothing had been posted about it. Very rude. We did not as a result bother going out to eat, out of worrying about dealing with parking...great way to end a trip. Im not a person who generally holds hotels to unreasonable standards, but for the price paid, and the parking that i paid for (even if just self parking), i think i should have been informed somehow that parking would be a mess on my last night, so i could have planned accordingly and i dont think i should have had to have delt with snotty rude parking attendants. When the manager was approached about the parking situation, he told me quite clearly that parking PARKING SPACES ARE NOT GUARANTEED...but said he THOUGHT there should'nt be a problem. I honestly think it is unprofessional for a hotel to not know its own capacity, or amount of people coming to an event. The manager did offer to valet the car free of charge, bit it still put a cramp on our trip All in all the place is NOT worth the price paid...they charge for virtually everything, and paying for self parking does in no way (unless you pay more for valet) guarantee a spot...something that was not made clear at booking. If you are here for leisure they will not care about your experience. Their special events clearly are more important than the experience for an individual average joe guest; i dont hold it against them; they are a business and big events make them money, but just be aware of this. For the price, unless you are here on Business i would not recomend staying here. The location IS good (if you have a car) but again parking isn't guaranteed even though they do charge you. Check-in staff are very friendly and helpful but the parking staff is hit and miss. The main reason i cant recommend this hotel, is because its lack of consideration of guests who pay for parking, by failing to inform them clearly of events that may cause issues leaving or arriving

<Title>“Wish our 2 Nights were 20 !”
<Content>We were attending a family wedding, and our room had been established for us for One night, we added a night to just relax after the wedding and take in the beauty of the area. Upon checking in, actually I asked for a convienent choice of rooms (handicapped). I was given choices, and the one I took without hesitation, was downstairs; with smooth step out on the patio/lawn & harbor view, which brought you to a concrete walkway. It was totally an awesome experience, at that particular location. Ate at the Buffet for Breakfast; excellent, with numerous multiple choices. Good Table service, for approx. 20 of us seated. We also went into the special, separate Bar area to have a drink, and take in the elevated night time view of the harbor. Everything flowed. The staff was excellent & helpful. We spoke with various groups of folks, especially one Educational Youth Group, well groomed...enjoying their stay also. Just an overall happy experience for everyone. Oh, I almost forgot, we spent an entire afternoon sitting around the beautiful pool with other family members....another lovely experience. We went into the gym area, excellent equipment. Entire Parking VERY full, but with our handicap plates, were able to park convienent to our room. [It Was a weekend!] Easy access to downtown San Diego; the Harbor; Beach Cities; of course, the Airport is across the road (but not a noise issue). And just being ON Harbor Isld. is a pleasure in itself. Would definitely repeat our visit/experience. Having good weather doesn't hurt either !!

<Title>“Great place to stay for MCRD graduation”
<Content>My son graduated from the Marine Corps on Novemeber the 4th. I scoured the internet looking for the best deal for the whole family to be able to go. I was concerned when after much comaprison shopping I booked a flight and stay at this hotel with savings of over 1,100 for our party! (What was I going to get?). When we landed I saw our hotel. It is very near the airport and also very close to the reason for our trip Marine Corps Recruit Depot. We stayed in the bay tower portion of the hotel. The lobby was clean and desk help was exceptional! They informed us that the package we booked included breakfast all the days of our stay as well as a free shuttle to and from MCRD This by itself was a fantastic bonus! We asked for a higher floor and rather than bay view, we chose the marina view. Decorated in a nautical theme; the rooms were very clean, the beds comfortable, had an amply stocked mini bar and a large balcony to enjoy San Diegos beautiful weather and watch all the boats sail. The hotel was close enough to either take a taxi to Old Town for some sight seeing (which we really enjoyed)..or rent a car..which we also did..and took the short drive over to Coronado Island had some fantastic pizza, a little shopping and played on the beach. After graduation my son was never so happy to see a soft bed or hot tub in in his life! We really enjoyed the nice pool facilities. In short our trip was great . We got a great price on a clean comfortable room in San Diego near everything we needed to do and wanted to see!

<Title>“Great price, OK location”
<Content>Stayed here Halloween weekend in order to visit friends and check out the Gaslamp District nightlife. The hotel was nice- room was clean, roomy, comfortable. We used Priceline and only paid $85 for a Saturday night so we think we got a fabulous deal. We even had a little balcony with a view of the harbor. The only thing people should be wary of, is this hotel is very close to the airport but about a 4-mile walk to the Gaslamp Dist. so if you want to dress up and go downtown, you need to take a cab- it cost us about $11 plus tip.

<Title>“This really should say : SHERATON AIRPORT HOTEL”
<Content>If you are looking for a family vacation resort, this is NOT for you. You have to drive through the airport to get to this hotel, which is IMMEDIATELY adjacent to the airport. We made the mistake of not carefully studying the map before booking this hotel. With that said, we got a Marina suite, which is very spacious, comes with 2 large flat screen TVs, 2 closets, but the bathroom was EXTREMELY small. We have 2 balconies that faces the harbor, and the view is breathtaking. Nothing is walking distance from the hotel, so you would have to drive or take a shuttle. The upgrade to club access is well worth it since they do serve breakfast and afternoon snacks. You do hear planes flying above as they takeoff and land, but it's not overwhelmingly disturbing. The sleep quality is poor. It's the type of mattress where as soon as you get on or off, you can hear the springs compress or decompress. Overall, although this hotel is "cheaper" than the other Starwood hotels nearby, considering it's close proximity to the airport and what you are getting, staying at the W, Westin, or US Grant will get you more bang for the buck.

I realized it upon arriving at my next destination and immediately called your Security / Lost & Found Department. Nicolas very kindly retrieved my "left behind item," packaged it up and sent it to my home, after allowing me to select the mode/cost of delivery which would best suit my needs. Thank you, Nicolas, for going above and beyond! I can't tell you how impressed I am, nor how many people I shared my story with! Keep up the excellent service!!

<Title>“Tired, tiny and smelly pillows”
<Content>This may be the straw that breaks my SPG habit, or at least, it will be the last of my Sheraton stays in the US. Have enjoyed great stays in S America and other places, but this tired and somewhat dumpy hotel doesn't deserve to be a category 3 much less a category 4. Have a tiny room, the pillows smell like they've been stuck up someone's armpit, and a view overlooks the parking lot. No wireless in the room (Club room). But, at least, I'm not getting calls and voicemails every couple of hours to buy into a timeshare, so this is an improvement over my end of the year Orlando stay.

<Title>“Lots of hidden gems - great meeting hotel”
<Content>This was my second stay in the last two years and though I'm usually not a huge Sheraton fan I really like this property a lot. Both times I was there for conventions and as others note the hotel is across the road from the airport and a ways from downtown. Since my partner and I walk this wasn't a huge issue. We simply walked the couple of miles downtown, a lovely walk, and took taxis to Balboa Park and Old Town. Within walking distance of the hotel are two restaurants, C-Level and Island Prime, that are consistent winners for us. On to the hotel. Check-in was a breeze. We arrived almost two hours early and just walked into a room, very nice. The property includes a few different buildings and I think may include some longer term and time share units in places. The Marina Tower is in the main part of the hotel. The Bay Tower is a bit of a stroll across the marina. We've only stayed in the Marina Tower and have been glad we did given its proximity to the restaurant, etc. We've eaten at the restaurant, service was good and food just ok. Quinn's, the on site tavern and eatery seems to have better food and has a decent selection of draft beers and nice ambiance (overlooks the marina and pool, or you can watch sports on any of a number of tvs). There are 3 tennis courts that we used every day and in two visits I don't think I've ever seen anyone else use them. Good condition, decent courts. There are two swimming pools and two hot tubs. We tended to like the smaller hot tub near the tennis courts. Unfortunately both the pools and hot tubs close at 10pm. The first time we stayed here, just over a year ago, that closing time was strictly enforced so even though we were a quiet couple in our 50's just relaxing we got chased. This time when 10pm and the guards rolled around we were sharing the hot tub with a pretty rowdy group of Canadians who successfully lobbied for one more 15 minute round in the tub. I thought it was an improvement for the guards to give folks a break. Re the rooms, they're very comfortable, not new but not run down either. The bathroom was nice though we had an issue with the bathroom sink draining slowly. We reported it and it was fixed immediately - then we were given a $50 "experience adjustment" credit for our trouble. We used it at the gift shop. Frankly I attribute that to the power of media like TripAdvisor - to avoid a bad review, and sure enough here I am recommending the hotel rather than whining about a slow sink. A couple other gems here - there are two fire pits by the marina that are just plain cool, and rocking chairs suitable for just relaxing by the fire. This property has lots of spaces for couples to just drift hand in hand. The grounds are well maintained and it's an expansive property. We took cabs to Balboa Park and Old Town, about $15 each way each time, and walked downtown. Other friends at the same convention also walked downtown - though all of us are walkers, we're also all in our 50's and 60's so don't be too afraid to take it on. Leaving - nothing is easier. Free airport shuttle. Oh re the meeting rooms, etc., standard hotel issue. With the exception of the main banquet the food was unremarkable, however, at our main lunch banquet everything was a notch above usual conference food (a wonderful tomato cream soup served hot for example). When you're traveling with the love of your life it's easy to find things to enjoy, and with the combination of this hotel and San Diego we had a wealth of wonders to choose from.

<Title>“As expected....”
<Content>Sheratons are usually quite good, and this one lives up to expectations. The rooms are nice and most have harbor or marina views. The airport is convenient. Negatives are expensive parking and limited internet connection. There is free wifi in the lobby, but wired internet connection in the room (and not free). I didn't consider the hotel restaurants to be anything special, but excellent dining is available short driving distances away. While the hotel is quite nice, I consider it to be overpriced, as are the other hotels on Harbor Island. A good place to stay, particularly if you are on an expense account:-)

<Title>“A Joy”
<Content>The SHERATON SAN DIEGO HOTEL & MARINA was the venue for a recent conference that colleagues and i attended. This hotel was first rate in all aspects and the staff were attentive and helpful at all times. The catering was superb and the bar had a lively and comfortable atmosphere, one of the best! If you want a trouble free enjoyable stay then this is the place to go.

<Title>“Not so good”
<Content>They try, I suspect, to be more or less professional. The service is spotty at best. Room keys fail daily. Hallway continuously scattered with dishes that stay for days. In room coffee is good. Food, which is good but not great, would be a good deal at half the price.

<Title>“Beautiful Shoreline Hotel”
<Content>My husband, son, and I stayed at this hotel over July 4th. It is just a few minutes from the San Diego Airport, but not in direct line with the runways, so there was no jet noise. It is also right on the water, and with a room facing the water, we had a fantastic view of the fireworks that night. It had easy access and was convenient for driving to other areas of San Diego. I especially liked the way the room was set up. The bed FACED the windows instead of being sideways to the windows like in most hotels, so you could sit in bed at night and look at the lights. The room was spotless as was the rest of the property, and the landscaping surrounding the hotel was very nice. If I remember correctly, there was also a sidewalk between the hotel and water that you could walk around the marina on. Depending on when you stay, and if you have AAA or some other discount plan, you can get a reasonable price for this hotel. At other times, the price can be double. We are going on a cruise in December and I was anxious to book this hotel again for our pre-cruise stay. However, there is a convention going on that week and when I first checked it out, the price had skyrocketed. The second time I checked, there were no rooms available. The only reason I am giving this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is not within walking distance to restaurants, and the hotel restaurant is pricey, as expected. We did go ahead and eat breakfast at the restaurant which was excellent, but again, it was not a "breakfast included" type of hotel and the cost for breakfast was about $15 per person, I think. But as I said, I did love this hotel and would stay there again. And for those who aren't budget minded, this is definitely a hotel you will love.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel”
<Content>Stayed here for 3 nights for business conference. Rooms were spacious and ours had small balcony with seating for 2. Beautiful views from room, we were on the 11th floor. Sheraton's have the best beds and bedding. Slept like a rock (or baby, whichever your view) each time. So comfy. We were in Marina tower which is great since it's the first one the shuttle driver stops at. Great to have free shuttle from airport to hotel. Water pressure in room needs some work but overall not bad, just not great. Check-in staff were really nice and allowed us to check in early, we were really excited as we only had the afternoon to be real tourist. Down side to this hotel and location - there is nothing around it - no restaurants, no public transportation. If you wanted to go anywhere you needed to use taxi's and they were expensive. The public transportation in SD needs help. We use the trolley (train) and bus system. Neither transportation types were user friendly even with assistance from transportation employees. You definitely need a car if staying here. Would be a great hotel if you wanted something close to airport or cruise lines. Ate lunch in restaurant on site one day and it was expensive for ok food. Had dinner in bar/grill one night and it expensive and better than restaurant. There is a deli within walking distance at the marina that does a great job of making sandwiches.

<Title>“tired hotel next to airport”
<Content>My husband and I recently spent 3 nights at the Sheraton while attending a conference. After a 60 second drive from the airport (yes, it is that close!), we checked into our room on the 9th floor. The lobby of the hotel was nice, although very busy with people attending a variety different conferences. The hallway to our room was scattered with leftover room service items. Our room was small, which was fine. The bathroom was recently redone. It sadly had no place to hang towels so when finished with them, we just set them on the floor. The shower curtain smelled like mildew. All the rooms have small balconies with a view of the water or downtown but if you open the balcony door you are bombarded with sound of jets landing and taking off. The outside of the property was nice, with several pools and a walking path. All in all, it is a very average convention hotel next to the airport.

<Title>“Nice stay, but nothing to write home about.”
<Content>When we arrived we discovered we were in the Bay Tower, not the Maruna Tower. We had no idea they were two separate locations and didn't discover it until bags were out of the car and lugged quite aways, after a 6 hour drive. The lady that checked us in was very nonchalant about it... We could take a 5minute walk, bags in tow or drag them back to the car and drive.FRUSTRATING! Our room was nicely decorated, beds were wonderful, all our contacts with employees was great! Our room could have been cleaner and they definitely should have changed the shower curtain (even the slightest bit of mold freaks me out). Overall a good stay, but I expect a spotless room for the amount we paid.

<Title>“Too many extra costs”
<Content>I will try to be objective and review this hotel fairly, though I was quite annoyed at how much this hotel tries to rob you at every opportunity. The check-in staff were polite. We were informed on check-in of a $30 a night parking fee (our stay was 4 nights), and when I inquired about how to access in-room internet they told me it was $19 a night for high speed internet. High speed internet was crap, it was less than a quarter of the speed of the internet I got at the Trump in Las Vegas. We were given two vouchers for complimentary breakfast for our stay, for which we were very grateful, though once we were seated in the restaurant and given menus we weren't quite sure what we were allowed to choose from. This was soon cleared up when someone came and took the menus back and said that we could only eat from the buffet. After eating the 'buffet' once, we decided not to use the second voucher. The room also has a fridge, but only for the rip off minibar, you weren't allowed to use it. Not only did it quote exorbitant prices on the mini bar it also had a RESTOCKING fee in the fine print. How does get buggered sound? I'm not going to pay $5 for a small drink and then pay you 20% extra just to restock it. The room itself was reasonable and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was a bit grubby though In all honesty I probably wouldn't have paid attention to this things had the hotel not been charging me extras at every opportunity, I found myself picking on things in the room just because they were being cheap. What sort of hotel doesn't have complementary in room internet these days??? Given that the last day of our USA trip was to be spent at this hotel before we drove to LAX, we decided that with the $30 parking fee and $19 internet per day in our room we'd be better off just finding a cheap room in Anaheim on our last nights stay so we were closer to the airport on the last day. We checked out early even though we had already paid for the room for the night and spend what we saved on ridiculous fees on a room in Anaheim.

<Title>“Not the best stay I've had”
<Content>I spent 3 nights in the Lanai section of this sprawling hotel. Problems began with the inadequate map and directions i was given for finding my room. Then the closet door was off its tracks and hard to open and the bathroom fan was incredibly noisy. The sliding glass door to the balcony was also very hard to move. The finishing touch was hair all over the bathroom wall, apparently from a previous occupant's hair drying session. I was there for a meeting (great conference facilities and excellent food) and got charged $100 for an early checkout when the meeting ended early. I never saw or heard another person in the wing I was in so I don't think there was a great demand for rooms. The sign saying I'd be charged $25 if I stored personal items in the minifridge added to the overall impression that this hotel does not go out of its way to make guests happy. Don't expect free internet or a welcome bottle of water.

<Title>“Very accommodating, clean, right on harbor.”
<Content>My wife and I have stayed here a couple of times during a business convention I had. Great location on the harbor. Both times, we got a room in the bay tower, harbor side, high floor. These rooms are equipped with balconies that overlook the harbor and the air force base. The sound of the helicopters didn't bother me at all during the day, but I did hear some people complaining about it. I found it very interesting to watch their training everyday. Nice rooms and very clean. Some need updating but clean nonetheless. Grounds are easy to get around on and there are little cafe's and bars and breakfast places within and around the hotel. The staff is very accommodating and prompt with special requests. Just a great place in a great city!

<Title>“fantastic hotel”
<Content>We really enjoyed our stay here, we were in the Bay Tower which we were quite grateful for as there was a big conference on in the main hotel. If you want to be in the city centre, this hotel isn't for you, but if you want nice service, and lovely rooms with a fantastic view I highly recommend this hotel. My only criticism is the lack of a laundry in the Bay Tower, we were told the laundry is on floor 5 of the Marina Tower, the Sheraton info booklet does not state this it all, and we were looking everywhere in our tower for the laundry which is the only reason this hotel did not get 5 stars from us.

<Title>“Clean and Convenient”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel while attending a conference. My options were to stay in the main hotel where the convention center is, or stay in the tower. Knowing that I would be sitting all day at conferences, I chose the tower which is a block away. I was very happy with my choice. The rooms are updated, modern, and clean. The staff, from the bellboys to the front desk, are friendly and helpful. Great experience overall.

<Title>“Marina Sheraton - one of our favorite hotels”
<Content>We have stayed here often; and still choose it because of the beautiful views from all sides. The club level Yacht club is amazing; bright and welcoming for breakfast with views of the city and the bay, the bridge to Coronado, and flights arriving to the nearby airport. At night the city is lit up like a jewelled necklace; very pretty. The rooms all have views; our preference is an end room with city view becuase we love to watch the planes arrive flying low over the city. Great area for walking around the marina; or riding bikes. It is quiet and beautiful and you can walk a mile or 8 miles; all in a safe and pretty area along the water. The food at club level was very good, attractive and crisp fruits and veggies; pita chips and hummus, small empanadas; well planned. You can order a cocktail in the club which is a plus in a place with as good a view as this I love being able to have a nice drink before going down to dinner. As usual great bed & bedding - which is why we stay with SPG. overall it is always a great experience here.

<Title>“There are much better options”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at this Sheraton on the last night of our trip to San Diego, before flying out the next morning. During the previous four nights of our trip we stayed in a WONDERFUL hotel right in downtown San Diego. The price of this Sheraton vs. the downtown hotel were virtually the same, so I expected the same quality hotel & experience. Boy, was I wrong. First of all, the Sheraton is out on Harbor Island, a strip of land that is apparently still being deveoped for tourists and doesn't contain much of anything except for a few hotels. We were dropped off at the hotel by a cab driver around 5PM and literally felt STRANDED for the rest of the evening. There are two restaurants inside the Sheraton, both of which are offensively overpriced. We left the hotel in search of food, and after walking over a mile, found a gas station-like store that sold prepackaged sandwiches. We trudged back to the hotel and reluctantly went to the cheaper of the two restaurants inside. We both ordered $16 hamburgers. That would be $16 each. The food was average at best and the service was neglectful at best. Definitely a frustrating venture. Secondly, I'm still confused about this hotel and what part of it we stayed in. The main entrance of the hotel is beuatiful and plush looking. When we checked in, we were instructed to follow a long hallway to the right. At the end of this hallway we stepped into an elevator foyer that looked completely different from the main part of the hotel. The carpet and wallpaper were old and discolored. It was like we all of a sudden were transported to an old motel. Once we reached our floor, it still felt like a motel, not a "nice" hotel - the hallway smelled stale, and there were several room service food trays laying throughout the hallway. Without even entering our room yet, I felt ripped off. I was immediately wishing we had just booked another night at our downtown hotel that was GORGEOUS and equally priced. Along the same lines of this confusing split-personality of the hotel - there are two pools outside. One is luxurious and updated. The other, right next to it, is older and smaller. Our hotel key would not allow access to the nicer pool. We were apparently relegated as "second-class" and were only allowed key access to the smaller pool. This was all VERY confusing and practically embarassing. There were no signs of explanation as to the difference between the two pools that were RIGHT next to each other. I will say that the room itself at the Sheraton was very lovely. It actually felt updated, clean, and new. I loved the color-scheme. Because there was NOTHING to do on Harbor Island, we just got in bed early and watched t.v. for the rest of the night. Overall, I would NOT recommend this hotel if you are in San Diego for more than just a layover. If you do not have a car, cab rides to and from downtown are about $14 each way. Although that is cheaper than a hamburger on Harbor Island, it is not worth the price just to get far enough away from the hotel to find something to do. There are PLENTY of hotels in downtown San Diego that are the exact same price and are INCREDIBLY nicer. Bottom line, this Sheraton isn't terrible, but you can do much better.

<Content>Had a great time in San Diego, the Sheraton was good, we had a beautiful view of the bay, watched the ships and boats go buy. The food was good. Its is out of the way to get to Gas Lamp Quarters and the Sea Port villlage, wouldn't stay there for that reason only, its a $20 cab ride each way. They need a shuttle, and that would be great. We did the green way at the hotel which gave you $5.00 per day back in a coupon, we used that at the resturants, or store. All in all it was great but the need a shuttle to the convention centre.

<Content>If you are looking for a lovely place to relax for a DAY in San Diego with immediate airport access, you cannot beat this hotel. It is not cheap, but if you are on business or booked at in conjunction with a cruise or something else, it is worth the money. However.... besides the lovely location and the beautiful walk along the harbor, there is really NOTHING out here and it's a cab ride to any other interesting parts of San Diego.

<Title>“Great for a conference - very good for a stay”
<Content>I went to the Disaster Recovery Journal Expo in San Diego and decided to stay at the conference hotel so that I could pour myself into bed every night! On arriving in San Diego we waited for 30 mins for the shuttle to the hotel, but it never turned up - it was 11 PM though. We ended up getting a cab, not realising it is VERY close to the airport! The cab took us to the wrong section of the hotel, so after a bit of a walk we ended up in the main part of the hotel. Check in was quick and easy, but when we asked about food and drink they told us that the bar was about to close but you could get food there. We therefore skipped going to our rooms and had a few pints of Blue Moon and a steak burger and chips. Apparently since the recession hit there are very few hotels with 24 hour bars in the States - very frustrating! So at midnight I went and found my room, which was on the 11th floor and fell asleep. In the morning I took stock of the room. Two king size beds (nice, just for me!) smart decor, flat TV, coffee maker and reasonable bathroom - shower over bath. Nothing fantastic but all new and stylish. On opening the blackout curtains I had an interesting view of the airport, the carpark and alot of the marina. I love boats so I was happy. You could see a couple of battleships and an aircraft carrier from my room. There was also a little private balcony which was fab for smoking cigars on and for sunbathing - great suntrap! It is MUCH less noosy than one might expect. We had booked club rooms which meant that we had breakfast in the club lounge included. This is great since you get a good continental breakfast in the lounge, which is nice and relaxed with an AMZING view across the marina and out towards the sea. It is quite difficult to actually find and access but worth it when you arrive. One very good thing about the club lounge is that you get free wifi (you only get wired internet in the rooms) so I chatted to Mrs M-B and the kids via Skype and could show off the great views too. The club lounge is quiet and relaxing and if I was not at a conference I would have chilled out there most of the time. We din't eat in the hotel other than on the first night at the sports bar, but we did order many drinks from there. Annoyingly they do not deliver drinks to the outside flame pits where you could chill out in the sun - we had to constantly try and carry trays of drinks through doors and down stairs. They also don't allow glass outside, but we didn't find that out until the last day! The hotel is not exactly in the centere of town but it is very easy to get a cab to where ever you wanted to go, although they did add up eventually. It is nice and quick to get back to the airport (5 mins). If you have things to do, such as conferencing, or sitghtseeing, then this hotel is great. If you booked it just to chill out in the pool, I suspect that you would be a bit bored after the first day. Hopefully I will come back to San Diego, but if I was given the choice and I was a single traveller I would stay at the W Hotel which is more central and funkier.

<Title>“Convenient, Clean, Comfortable accomodations”
<Content>This hotel had very comfortable, airy rooms that were perfect on our recent visit to San Diego. Although near the airport and harbor, there was little noise and night and a staff willing to assist. The staff was helpful in getting around in the city and directed us to our destinations. In particular Mark, bell captain, acted as concierge and offered some great insight about his city and we were most grateful. He also made suggestions and reservations at Island Prime for our anniversary dinner. The meal and service there was excellent. We thank him for his courtesy. There were two problems that came up during our stay, They charge $22 per day for self parking that never seemed to work correctly and $18 per day for wired in internet. Since there was no wi-fi, we ended up at Starbucks to go on the net for emails and directions to some of our destinations. We think Sheraton should look into in room wi-fi right away. The parking problem was a due to card reader issue with the room keys. Management was working on the problem and it worked once for us but the bug returned. We would highly recommend a stay there because of the quality of the property, location and convenience to get around. We would definitely return there in the future.

<Content>The rooms are very spacious. The bathrooms are a little small but still nice. Just two small things I noticed when we got to our room. There was silverware outside our room and a little hair in the floor and the side of the bathtub. A little more attention to detail by housekeeping would take care of this. Love the balcony with table and chairs looking out over the water. Overall a nice hotel.

<Title>“Very mixed experience”
<Content>We have stayed in this hotel complex twice, and have had very "iffy" experiences here. The property is really well situated if all you care about is being close to the airport, but is poorly located if you want to do anything other than hang around the hotel complex. Both times, our rooms were in serious need of remodel - especially the bathrooms, which were just plain old and yucky. Our most recent stay found us stuck on what amounts to the basement level of the Bay Tower, a building which is completely unacceptable in every way. While the staff, both at the Valet Desk and the Front Desk, were pleasant, they were entirely unhelpful in every respect. The one, hugely Bright Spot was a young Bellman who not only helped us with our luggage at 4:30 AM, but unexpectedly drove us straight over to the airport, rather than making us wait for the hotel's airport shuttle service to get started for the day. Had it not been for that wonderful surprise, I would have given this hotel an even lower rating.

<Title>“Nice if you stay in the main tower!”
<Content>This property has 2 towers about 5 blocks from each other. The Bay Tower has some nice ocean views but it appears to be their overflow hotel and too far from all the amenities of the main building. It looks like they put their guests who have booked discounted rates in this tower. The rooms are big with flat screen tv's, but the bathroom was filthy. Hair in the tub and toothpaste all over the wall. I booked this room through Priceline which includes it with the downtown hotels. It is not a downtown hotel. It is an airport hotel with about a 1 hour walk into the downtown. I walked it! The main property has a nice lobby with lots of free internet stations, a Starbucks, nice dining areas and a beautiful pool.

<Title>“Amazing Experience”
<Content>This hotel is located on Harbor Island, on a small strip of land right across from the airport. It is beautifully decorated to feel like you are on a ship. VERY NAUTICAL! I was traveling alone on business and I felt very safe and comfortable. The rooms have balconies with views of the Navy vessels coming in and out of the harbor AND views of the boats docked in the harbor. The military helicopters are crusing around and you can't help but get the feeling that our country is being protected. You can feel the excitement and energy of San Diego and sleep in an amazing room. . .The bed, shower, coffee machines. . . It made me feel very special. . . .Highly recommend this place.

<Title>“Great Value but can't walk to downtown”
<Content>This hotel always offer great rates and if you are looking to stay near sea world and the bay its a good location. If you are looking to indulge in the nightlife of the gaslamp district you are better off at the W, Hard Rock or the US Grant hotel. This is primarily a tourist hotel for families or a good place to stay if you have a flight out the San Diego airport. The hotel is starting to show its age and is need for an update.

<Title>“Disappointed”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton due to a conference my wife and i wanted to attend. When registering we paid for a room on a higher floor that promised a view of the harbor and city. When we checked in we were told the rooms were being cleaned and they would call us in a couple of hours to check in. We went site seeing and came back SEVEN hours later, the check in was busy and finally got the bell captain to help us. We were informed they didn't have a upper floor room and we were placed on tthe "fourth" floor - which actually was the 2nd floor overlooking a beautiful gravel roof overhand! Complaints went unanswered until 3 days later when we were finally given a rate adjustment back to the convention rate. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!!!!

<Title>“Business stay, great surroundings, catering pretty good”
<Content>Stayed for 3 days in mid-Sept. Hotel is on great running trails. Gym is very good. Rented a bike there, too. It wasn't in the greatest shape, but I was just cruising and had a great time because it was available cheaply ($7/hr). There were a couple of pools but it would have been better if at least one of them were set up so you could do laps. One is long enough but curvy, so you can't seriously swim straight across and back for an extended workout. They're just designed for splashing and lounging. Room was nice enough and comfortable. I liked that you could decline housekeeping service and get a $5 credit. Hotel has lots of enviro features, which I appreciated. The catered meals were very good. We ate breakfasts and lunches on a lawn outside the conference center, which was really nice. Watch out for heels sinking into the grass and slightly damp chairs in the morning, but I enjoyed it. The bar food was standard hotel fare. Only thing that raised my eyebrows is during a snack break, they served sports energy bars--as snacks! I scooped up a couple because I would only eat these on a 7-mile or longer run--they were packed with glucose/fructose/sucrose. Believe me, most people at the conference did not need to be eating athletic fuel bars as a snack between sedentary meeting sessions. Overall I really enjoyed my time there, and would consider going back for business, though probably not the family because there weren't a lot of restaurants close by and we try to do more economic eating when on longer stays with the kids.

<Title>“Poor value and even poorer service”
<Content>Stayed here for a business trip. Found out after I checked in that parking is $22 per day, added to the room; valet is $30. The main parking is quite far from the entrance - all side entrances are looked and you must walk all the way to the front to enter the hotel. Must use room key to enter and exit parking area. When checking in, your credit card is authorized $200 more than the cost of the room for "incidentals." No exceptions. Not told this in advance either. The hotel staff is less than helpful. Try asking for restaurant recommendations or what to do in San Diego. Better off asking for help from locals outside the hotel. My room, at a conference rate, was $169 per night. Not bad for San Diego, but what do you get? An armchair with a ottoman next to it, a small dresser, a huge with no drawer, two nightables, a small TV, and a very small bathroom. The closet is teeny tiny as well. And no free WI-FI - you have to pay an extra $12 bucks per day. At check in the desk clerk wanted to give me two queen size beds with a city view. Hello...my reservation was for a KING size. What do you know, one was available with a marina view. For that price, it darn well better be a marina view. Will I be back? No way.

<Content>The Sheraton Harbor Island BAY TOWER is conveniently located and the rooms are very nice. The rooms are oversized. The bed was very comfortable. The view of the marina was very relaxing. Look for specials. I was able to book the room at less than half of the standard rate.

<Title>“In every way, an awful place...”
<Content>I had one of my worst hotel experiences at this hotel. Lured by the mention of "billions of dollars in renovations, I expected -- for the money I spent per night, a luxury hotel experience. Let's start with the bathroom - very cramped and the "soaking tub" was a small plastic molded tub that only a child could bathe it. The light switches were put in very crooked. There was, I think, a hole in the wall that had a weird, hand cut plastic sheet over it. It was not enitrely clean and neither was the rest of the room. Weird bed layout had your bed FACING a huge mirror which mean you had not chocie but to see yourself everytime you glanced up from a book if reading in bed or when watching TV. I always test the honesty of hotel staff but leaving a dollar bill on the floor. In the hunderd times before that I had done this, the bill was always neatly placed on a piece of furniure. Not this time. Trash was not removed from my room, and it was very clear from debris on the rug that it wasn't vacuumed. The direct line to room service often did not work; they did not answer, and the front desk would say they would call me back, which they only did 50% of the time. The food was barely passable, and I stayed at a 4 Season in April that charged LESS for really amazing food with such gracious service. I approve of adding a percentage onto the bill automatically so wait staff can be properly tipped, but why was there also an additional $3 food delivery charge added on to the obligatory 16% tip? They advertise their link in service as being this great benefit, but what it means is you need to spend $18 a day for online service in your room or you lug your computer down to the lobby with the worn furniture to work. The ballyhooed TV wake up service did not work at all; thank God I set up a back up with my iPad of I would've missed meetings. I stay at different kinds of hotels -- a month before I stayed at a comfort inn near Olympia, WA, and had a MUCH better experience for MUCH less money. if you are looking for a quality experience, do NOT choose this hotel. They should be ashamed of allving this a luxury hotel.

<Title>“Pretty Good Hotel, Service Lacking, Sticker Shock for Parking Fees”
<Content>I booked this hotel on Priceline based on location trying to find a nice hotel close to downtown San Diego. The hotel property is quite nice and even though it is right across the street from the airport, the airport noise is not a factor. There is no free parking at this hotel, only valet or self parking and it is fairly steep per day ($22 for self parking when I stayed) which add up quickly. There are in and out privileges however. The hotel lobby is beautiful and check-in was smooth as they have several front desk clerks assisting visitors. The rooms are fairly nice, not upscale (not sure it is quite a 4 star hotel), but were clean and bright and had no funky smell like a lot of hotel rooms. The beds and pillows were wonderful and my friend and I kept wondering how we could buy some of those pillows! I did not appreciate the lack of follow through with the check-in staff. I originally booked 4 days through Priceline about a month before my trip. A few days later, I decided to add another day (which Priceline lets you do at the same bid price through checkin.) When I checked in at the hotel, they could not find my fifth night. The clerk said she would take care of it. Later that evening, I checked with the front desk and she still had not resolved the problem. The next day, still not resolved. By the 4th day, I had been told by numerous front desk clerks that the matter would be taken care of but it never was resolved by the hotel. I had to call Priceline several times and waste a lot of vacation time to resolve it myself. I can say that after check out, the desk clerk did credit some on my parking bill for the hassle, which was appreciated, but I would have preferred that when their desk staff says they will resolve a problem that they actually resolve it. Another minor irritation was housekeeping. Although housekeeping came every day and replaced the towels and made the beds, they did not actually clean the bathroom which I found odd. My friend who was traveling with me for a few days got her feet really dirty one day and when she took a shower, there were dirty footprints all over the tub. The next morning, they did not clean it. I had to clean it myself with a washcloth and shampoo before I could take a shower. The sink got pretty crusty after a few days and the mirror was also spotted and never cleaned. Also, there was one of 3 bathroom lights burned out when I checked in. I just presumed housekeeping hadn't been in that room for a few days and hadn't notice the light burned out and would change it during my stay. Never changed. I found this to be substandard for what claims to be a 4 star property. Otherwise pretty good stay.

<Title>“Next to airport- literally.”
<Content>This hotel should be a 3 star. The rooms, bed/linens/bathroom- everything are average. It felt like we were driving to the airport and bam -we were at our hotel. Yes we could see planes taking off out our window- so if you like planes this is perfect. I had to request a new room because our bedspread was stained and there was mold in the bathtub. Second room was a downgrade but at least it was clean and they gave us a breakfast voucher. Great bargain if you get it on priceline- but don't buy the rack rate. Overpromise, underdeliver. Btw- Coffee was stale in the room.

<Content>This is the second year my sister and I have stayed in the hotel. Have always found the staff very helpful and they take the time to greet ,make you feel welcome.During this stay San Diego had the power outage. It lasted from about 10 hours. The staff went into motion to see everyone was comfortable during this time. We had breakfast every morning in the resturant. Was greeted by Ronnie who was the resturant manager, he took time fo ask about our visit and let us know about things in the area to do. We also requested the same room we had as the last visit. They did everything to accomdate our stay. Great Hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>“Average but with Security Concerns”
<Content>I stayed at this property on a business trip for a conference. The room was fine and, were I not working most of the time, I might have been able to enjoy the small balcony. The bed was not particularly comfortable and the use of a bottom flat sheet that slipped up from the end uncovering the scratchy mattress pad underneath made for poor sleep quality. The shower was OK - the water was hot but the water pressure was not great. The staff as part of the conference was very good and responsive. My biggest complaint is that I came back to my room one evening to find the door open. I decided to go in when I saw that a light was on but was certainly concerned about the possibility of an intruder. I called the front desk right away and they sent up a security guard. I checked and it did not seem as if anything was taken. The security guard took some data from the door lock and confirmed that the last key used was from housekeeping. I was just fortunate that my room was a bit further down the hall that a passer-by didn't take advantage of the door being left open. This is a huge concern for me and while the conference customer service was good and the room was OK, it is unlikely that I will stay at this property again unless I have to for business reasons.

<Title>“Decent hotel in most ways”
<Content>Okay. This is what you'd expect. A large "resort" hotel not really within walking distance of anything. If you want to go anywhere, expect a cab ride or other means. So it's not too bad, but just not great. The good. It is in a very nice location, near the water (Mission Bay, which is NOT the ocean), and has great views of things like the naval base, the bay, Coronado Bridge, etc. (more on this in a bit). Great walking trails nearby, nice and quiet, decent hotel accomodations, etc. From that standpoint, it's great. And, it is REALLY close to the airport. Decent pools for the kids, and the usual amenities such as gym, Starbucks, etc. The bad. There's little nearby. You are going to travel anywhere, such as Gaslamp, downtown, La Jolla, Qualcomm, Padres, the beach, Corondado, you name it. Also, WHY MAKE ME PAY FOR INTERNET? When are hotels going to learn this is like making us pay for TV in the old days? It's not a sign of being progressive and hip, it's a sign of being out of touch! What's next, making me pay for local calls (cringe)? And, you are stuck most of the time in this hotel, at their mercy with restaurants. If that's okay with you, that's okay. Our room. Without doing anything (I think) to annoy the check-in staff, we got ABSOLUTELY the worst room in this place - room 5135 (don't agree to take this room!!). We didn't complain - were there on business and spent little time there (so management don't reply that we shouldn't have requested - we shouldn't have been put in such a dumpy room to begin with!!), but this was a crappy room. I happened to visit the room of other meeting attendees, including those without Sheraton Club membership, paid same amount, came in later, etc., and they mostly all had significantly better rooms in terms of views. And trust me, it matters at this hotel. Our room (again, 5135 - avoid it!) looked out on a parking lot and a green wall adjacent to tennis courts, while others looked out on the bay, airport landing jets, city skyline (imagine how all this looks at night?). It sucked. And, it smelled of mold - inspection of the air unit outside showed it all mildewed, etc. Not nice at all. The room interior was decent, not much to comment on from there (except the damn paying for internet). It seems to me that lousy rooms should be given out last, not early on during the day - a pet peeve of mine - why doesn't their computer system have some sort of ranking system and give out rooms in terms of some ranking system? Long story short, thanks Sheraton, and I'll certainly remember this room! I do commend them for deducting $5 / night for not having maid service. Great practice, and I hope it shows on the final bill. I like that. The sports bar on premise is pretty good, and food is okay although pricey and service is spotty (what did you expect given this was a self-contained resort hotel). The restaurant is same, except we found service there to be really poor (we complained, and to her credit, waitress took the blame for shoddy service, although she blamed it on a "large party of 40" which was there that night - at a hotel that seems to host large parties all the time, thank god there wasn't a party of 400 or we still might be there - and on a Sunday night with few other patrons. You figure for yourself on that one.). Restaurant food was pretty good, but prices were high for poor service. But what do you expect given a hotel with no competition within walking distance? Summary: Good hotel. Watch where they put you, which room. Enjoy the sports bar in moderation. The hotel restaurant is good but with poor service for us. Would I stay here again? If I want the big cookie-cutter experience.

<Title>“Nautical & Nice”
<Content>Thie hotel was very well-equipped with restaurants, spa services, and a great gift store. Beautiful walking areas all around the hotel, in the marina and bay area. My room had a nautical theme that was sweet. Bed was comfortable and cozy. Couldn't get WiFi working, but took it as a sign that work should be done for the day, as I had been up for almost 2 days on this trip! The air conditioning was on full blast and it couldn't be adjusted. When I called to inquire about it, they were quick to handle the situation, and brought me complimentary fruit tray as apology for the half hour intrusion. The service man was wonderful, friendly yet professional and very thoughtful. Great location for airport convenience, bad location for downtown convenience.

<Title>“A lovely hotel but miles from the centre of town”
<Content>We booked here, via a 'travel' website which said that it was 5 minutes from Gaslamp. No such thing!! To get into the centre of San Diego we had to catch the hotel bus to the airport and get public transport into town (and do the reverse to return). The hotel, like any big chain, is comfortable but impersonal and staff weren't very sure about whether the trolley tour stopped at the hotel or when. Given that it's a daily occurence (at 9.50am for the Bay Tower) I thought this was rather strange

<Title>“The "Step-Child" Effect”
<Content>This was suppose to be an "Upgrade", WOW! what a dissapointment. The location is wonderful, the view spectacular . . . the room, staff & service, amemities and personnel, a disaster. One company, two hotels, one; newer, cleaner, the "A TEAM" staff, a place to sit and have a relaxing drink, a meal, whatever you liked to do. The other location, (the one we got) the "rejects" of staff, un-informed, non-communication experts. A gift shop that always seems closed, as well as a diningroom that closes "just because, there hasn't been that much business tonight". Really? To add to that; we had a toilet that continued running, non-stop. We called the front desk and asked to have it worked on. The reply was that "we'll send someone up in the morning, it's too late now; (it was 7pm). The next day I went to the front desk to ask about the running toilet situation. They we un-informed of any such situation. I asked that something be done while we were out for the entire day. We gave our cell phone numbers to them, (in case, they needed to move us to another room). During the day we recieved no calls. When we returned that evening, we opened our room the the sound of silence. However, the remedy for repairing the toilet was to simply turn off the water supply; no note, no calls, no nothing. I went downstairs to ask about the toilet, to which (of course) they knew nothing. I asked to be moved to another room, they made a new card for a room next door( never offering to assist with the move or even apoligizing for the trouble). As I stated before; great location, great view, terrible facility, it's definitly the "Step-Child" of this company. We'll never stay there again.

<Title>“Enjoyed our stay”
<Content>I had selected this hotel because of the close to airport location and thought we might have a nice view. We were just returning from a cruise and wanted a day to sight see in San Diego. We were on the marina side so the view didn't turn out as well as I had hoped. The room was nice and we spent quite a bit more time in the hotel than anticipated because my husband was not feeling well. We had to walk quite a way to find something to eat and ended up at what was really a coffee shop. Overall, I thought it was a nice hotel.

<Title>“All rooms have a view!”
<Content>We were on the 10th floor - with wonderful views of the marina and the city. other rooms had views of the marina and the ocean. we were very happy with the quality of the room and the service. free internet in the lobby, however $26 parking each day was fairly hefty. only 15 minutes away from san diego zoo and around 15 minutes - the other way to sea world - great location and very easy to get around, especially with a GPS - we drove from san francisco to san simeon to anaheim to san diego - the roads are very well sign posted and the main attractions are easy to find. the prices in the hotel restaurants are very pricey - but nothing is close by - you have to drive to get to a cheaper place to eat. Spend more time in san diego - go and see the city, as well as the zoo, safari park and sea world - san diego is a lovely city and worthy of a day or 2 just getting around in the city.

<Content>One of my favorite San Diego hotels. Friendly staff. Easy to find. Assessable parking. Nice bar and restaurants. Nice Executive Lounge. There are two hotels on the property. About a 5 minute walking distance apart. One tower is the "luxury" tower, has all the amenities and fill up fast. The tower tower is more secluded and has a better view of the San Diego Harbor. Ask which tower you will be put in. Both are a short car drive or bicycle ride to the main Port area.

<Title>“Rooms could use an update”
<Content>Stayed here one night through priceline when the stay for my conference ended elsewhere. The main issue with this place in the rooms. The first room I was given had stained carpet, peeling wallpaper and was just not that clean. They were gracious about moving me and the second room was better but there was still a very large stain on the carpet near the bed. Overall, the rooms are decent but could use an upgrade and good cleaning. The location is OK - especially if you want to stay near the airport. It's on a Marina which is nice and you can walk out into a park that is attached. This is not a place that is convenient to downtown however. Count on cabs (which are not that cheap there) to get anywhere else. I asked about public transportation options but there really isn't too much around. You can walk to downtown if you are a walker and ambitious. There is a pathway.

The staff was friendly and helpful, and I really like the $5 reward per day for participating in the "green" program! If you want a nice view, request a room on an upper floor. Noise from the airport is noticeable regardless of which side you're on, but quiets down by 11:00 or so each night.

<Title>“Nice Location, Bad Customer Service”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel & Marina (Bayside) for three days attending a conference at the hotel. My first night in room 1167 I discovered the thermostat did not work and air conditioner would continue to blow cold air. I made it work by turning the unit on and off several times during the night. The next morning on the way to the conference, I mentioned the problem to the Front Desk and they advised they would send Maintenance to fix the problem. I returned to my room at lunch and found the thermostat was displaying in Celsius and the unit was blowing heated air (as in furnace). I called Guest Services who reported that Maintenance reported the problem as fixed. Guest Services scheduled a second visit from Maintenance and I went back to the conference. I returned to the room at dinner and found no evidence of a visit from Maintenance. I contacted Guest Services who advised they had not heard back from Maintenance and would send someone right away. I advised I would be back in the room around 8 PM and if the problem was not fixed the problem would be escalated to the manager. I returned at 8 PM and the problem was not fixed and the room was super hot. I contacted Guest Services who advised Maintenance was on their way. Fernando from Maintenance quickly arrived and within five minutes determined the unit was broken and would only blow heated air until it was repaired. Fernando contacted the Front Desk and advised them to move us to another room and send a bellhop up to assist in the move. I waited 30 minutes (sitting outside on the balcony to stay cool) and no bellhop. I walked down to the Front Desk and spoke with the manager Dana over the phone. Dana guaranteed the bellhop would be up quickly to assist us and she was researching ways to properly compensate me for my unnecessary troubles. We received a call from Sue at Guest Services asking how our new room was (by calling us in our old room?). We advised we are still waiting on a bellhop and keys to the new room. Sue advised she was working on a compensation package for us to make up for the full day off troubles. Thirty minutes later, I went back down to the front desk and received the keys to room 1172 and I moved myself into the new room. I did meet a maid as I was transferring to the new room that was sent to clean my old room (???). We never saw a bellhop, Sue from Guest Services never called back to offer compensation and Dana the manager never called back to offer compensation. During checkout, I had to argue my point as to why the hotel should remove a charge for a movie rental never finished in the old room. A few days prior to this I stayed at another San Diego hotel during a widespread, 12 hour power outage. I experienced better customer service from that hotel, under the worst of condition compared to the Sheraton Hotel & Marina under the best conditions.

<Title>“Excellent experience”
<Content>I too was in San Diego for my nephew's Marine graduation from boot camp and the power outage. I cannot say enough about the wonderful staff at this hotel. They were so prepared, not one person in our group felt any discomfort during this situation. What could have been a trying night for all ended up being alot of fun. Thank you to Adam in Quinn's Bar! He was an amazing server. The rooms, the staff, the shuttle drivers--all excellent. Thank you so much! Great job!

<Title>“Great hotel lacking in customer service”
<Content>This is a great property and I'd definitely stay here again. Offers 3 pools and decently sized rooms with balconies. Our view of the marina was beautiful. Some reviewers complained about the location, but it's nice not to be in the downtown area(scuzzy, with lots of homeless!! --- I know they have to live somewhere, but when you're traveling with family you do not want to deal with that element.)Â  My main complaint with this hotel would be the lack of customer service and their VERY STRONG air freshener. Certain people in my party loved it, but it was definitely not allergy friendly. It had me wheezing before I even completed the checkout process and I had a headache for the rest of our stay. Got up to our room, we decided to order room service and relax before heading down to the pool. I called room service four times and called the front desk, but nobody picked up! I started pushing other buttons in an attempt to ask about room service or other dinning options, but again no answer. The only people that did answer were the valet and they had my car waiting for me proptly every time(good job valet! That was the best service we received while there) I called and asked for two extra blankets, several hours later they never came. After making a follow up call(which AGAIN was not picked up) I went downstairs and requested the two blankets in person. Eventually they sent up ONE blanket.Â  My room was also charged over $50 in minibar charges for items that were never removed from the fridge. Called to have it corrected, was told someone had to come check the fridge before we checked out, but no one ever came, we waited over an hour for a person to come up!! Finally went down and was told by the desk that they already reversed the charges... So why on earth didn't any staff member bother telling me this??? Because of the wait we ended up being late to our next destination.Â  Great hotel, bad customer service!!Â

<Title>“Great Customer Service”
<Content>I recently stayed at this hotel for my cousin's graduation from Marine boot camp. The hotel offered a free shuttle to the Recruit Depot. This weekend had a large power outage, and the hotel staff were extremely friendly and offerred free waters and snacks. The room was newly remodeled and very clean. If you stay here, eat at C Level- it's a great restaurant within walking distance (.3 miles?). Great hotel!

<Title>“A great place to get stranded”
<Content>I was stuck in San Diego during the big power outtage and after rushing over from the airport I was met with a huge line out the door of this hotel and only limited power from a generator. What could have been a long miserable experience was instead a really nice stay at a great hotel! The staff all pitched in and passed out bottled water, kept everyone informed and even made sure there were a few emergency power receptacles for people to charge their phones. It looked like they had practiced for ths type of event because everything went so smoothly. Since the rooms had no power everyone was given a glow stick when the checked in and with an open sliding glass door looking over the bay I got a very plesant night of sleep. The restaurant fed everyone with the limeted cold food they had like salads and sandwiches, but most importantly, the bar was open and they had plenty of cold bottled beer on hand! This would be a great hotel to stay at normally but even being "stuck" there was a pleasure because of the helpful staff.

<Title>“Lights out in San Diego”
<Content>A 12 hour power outage starting at 3:40 pm on 9/8/2011, left most of San Diego and southern California without power. When I arrived at the hotel at 6, thanks to the airport shuttle and reservations booked with Starwood by my wife, the line for check in was out the door. Within 1 minute the management of the hotel was over communicating about the power status, providing water for folks in line, answering questions about what food and beverage services were available, and making everyone in line comfortable. Not only did their response to the power outage demonstrate phenomenal service, it demonstrated leadership, organization and preparedness. The front desk staff were graceful under pressure, the wait staff and bartenders bent over backwards for the guests, and the kitchen knocked it out of the park preparing food for every guest. I can't think of anything they could have done better in an emergency situation. Kudos to the Harbor Island, San Diego Sheraton staff.

<Title>“Beautiful hotel, great location!”
<Content>First class hotel and great accomodations, the room was very comfortable. The view of the bay and marina was spectacular, very nice pool, nice restaurants if you don't feel like going out. The one down side was the cost of parking at $22 per night but we will definitely stay again because the location is worth it.

<Title>“Money not well spent on multi-million dollar remodel!”
<Content>We won't be back to this hotel. We stayed in the Lanai building in what they call a town house. It has two levels. Upstairs bathroom and main bedroom. Downstairs, bathroom with no bath or shower. Sofabed plus rollaway was for the children. The furniture was insanely heavy to move around which you have to do if you want to pull out the sofa! So once the sofabed is out you have virtually no room to move. The most interesting mistake is the way the balcony is designed. There is a great view of the harbor, BUT if you sit on the chairs on the balcony you see the railing of your balcony instead of the view....How dumb is that? Who got paid to design that? Plus it takes forever to get to the building from the lobby and the final part is really ugly.

<Title>“Handled conference and Black out well”
<Content>Attended a conference of 450 people for FMA. The hotel staff were gracious. On Thursday night when the "big" power outage occurred, they kept one elevator running in each bank of elevators, moved up our social from 6:30 to 4:30, had food and drinks, ice water and ice for over three hours on the lawn for our group. Quickly rechecked in folks who were planning to leave that night but needed to stay an extra night. Provided candles for us to continue to enjoy the evening outside and lit the fire boxes. Overall, the staff handled everything very well including the long lines that formed once everyone at the airport decided they were there for the night and quickly converged on the nearest hotel. They kept the kitchen going, providing what food they could under the circumstances. The true test of a hotel is putting them through a crisis such as the regional black out for almost 12 hours. Good job!

<Title>“Decent place to stay near the airport”
<Content>This hotel is ideal if you want to be based near the airport. However, the pictures exaggerate the hotel's location and the places to walk for food or entertainment are limited. At least you would need to call a taxi. Everything else is what you would expect from a nice sheraton hotel.

<Title>“Not bad..”
<Content>We have stayed at the Marina Hilton before but this time we were assigned to the "Tower". This was a former Westin that was added on the Sheraton. They are actually a good 10 minute walk from each other. That really is the only bad thing. The rooms and service was good but there is only one restuarant and the service there was not good. I would reccomend the hotel if you are planning to eat out for everything. Also when you get a room at the Sheraton ask if it is at the main hotel or the tower. Big difference..

<Content>We arrived at the hotel during a mojor power outage and cannot believe how quickly they had everything together that they could do to make it as easy as possible to check in. They did little things such as having bottles water for the guests standing in line to check in and set up a dinner buffet so people could eat during the outage. Staff also handed out glow sticks as the rooms were dark. I would suggest you give them a try as just a wonderful staff and nice hotel.

<Title>“Not of Sheraton Quality, beware there are two towers!”
<Content>The Bay Tower is the pits. First, it suffers from the Holiday Inn look. If you book with your SPG points, you will get placed in the cheaper Bay Tower, unless you complain. Rooms suffer from echos from the parking lot (design flaw - big time!). The Bay Tower also has rooms that overlook the bayside, but the road noise is loud, and every voice or music echos up to the balcony and into your room! Lacks minimal things like toothbrushes, robes, and slippers (not like other Sheratons I stayed at!). No refrig - unless you ask? Coffee maker did not work, minimal tea selection - cheap, cheap. Loud lobby area which looks cheap as well. I don't think they offer any upgrades for Gold/Platinum members since it appears all the rooms are the same. It's not worth the 10 K points, maybe 7k at most. The Marina Tower maybe better - well, at least looks better from the lobby/drive up area! If you are paying "big bucks", I would recommend looking elsewhere, but don't stay in the Bay tower!

<Title>“Superb Location”
<Content>We arrived in San Diego after a 14hr Journey from the UK. We caught the complimentary shuttle bus provided by the Sheraton to the Marina Tower, we checked -in and was offered a choice of rooms. We took a room over looking the Harbour in the Lanai rooms. They had two queen beds, desk/work area, coffee maker with a good selection of coffees and teas.These rooms had plenty of space for a family of four 3ads 1 teenager. The balcony was great to watch the sunset in the evening and to watch the harbour. The room was immaculate, sparkling clean bathroom. This hotel had a Starbucks on site, there was a outdoor restaurant Shorelines this was amazing the portions were huge. There was the Harbour Edge restaurant which was open from breakfast til late,Martini Tapas bar, then there was the sports bar Quinn's where you could order food til late and a gift shop.Fitness centre, Spa room fee applied to that, the pool areas were excellent two pools/hot tubs. tennis courts, bike rentals, boat rentals.They had kids activities and on Friday and Saturday they had a Dive in Movie which was a good idea you could swim whilst you watched the movie or just relax on a lounger with a drink and a snack. We opted for the Help the Environment this was a good idea you got $5 voucher for everyday you stayed, if you didn't want all your bath towels and sheets changing every day they came in and just made your bed and refilled the mini bar and your complimentary coffee and teas. We used the vouchers towards eating in Shoreline. The location wasn't a problem I had heard and read from others it was out of the way. Yes it's a little out of the way but it is a nice walk along the front towards Downtown (Little Italy, Gaslamp Quarter, Seaport Village) we took the walk at a leisurely pace and it took just over 1/2hr. We didn't hire a car for our 5day visit and to be honest it's not necessary unless you want to visit the beaches near La Jolla and Oceanside. I would recommend the 2day old town trolley tour this helps with finding out about the area and where you want to spend your time exploring in more depth. We did get a taxi back to the hotel this cost $12 with tip and we also took the MTS public transport this was brilliant we took the hotel shuttle bus back to the airport and boarded the 992 bus to Broadway and we took the no 7 bus to the zoo it took just over 40mins and it was $5 for all day per person you can't get better than that. I think rather than pay $22 per day parking at the hotel and whatever the cost to hire your car using the local transport is good. Ralphs grocery store was good to get a few provisions for the day out at the zoo. This was near Market St in Gaslamp area. The history of the Gaslamp area was fascinating,especially if your into Wyatt Earp etc and around the 1800's, the Old Town was also full of History and really enjoyable to wander round and taste some of the local foods and crafts. The zoo is a must..... start early though, this will enable you to see the animals before it gets too hot and there sleep time.There is so much to do and see in Balboa Park it's worth spending the day there. Coronado is beautiful. Highly recommend the hotel and the area.

<Title>“Awesome Staff!”
<Content>When the power outage hit San Diego I was in the airport and I did not want to sleep on the airport floor. Quite a few other people had the same idea and we all headed for the Sheraton. When we got there they had a generator powered up and the entry way was well lit to welcome us. Someone was handing out water bottles to the long line of people and assuring us they had room for us. Someone else quickly figured out that the Bay Tower had availability and took a bunch of us over there in the shuttle bus. The front desk staff was hand running credit cards and writing down the room numbers on a piece of paper. Every staff person was friendly and calm. Upon checking in we were handed glow sticks so we could find our way around. They told us they had a dinner buffet set up in the main hotel. Ever staff person there was working efficiently and with a smile on their face. The food was very good and the service was excellent. All this without electricity. It was obvious the hotel staff were prepared and trained for this kind of crisis. If they weren't they sure faked it well. I was so impressed with every staff person I encountered and want to thank them for making what could have been truly miserable, something quite nice.

<Title>“Great in all respects”
<Content>Stayed 13 nights whilst visiting San Diego. My wife and I live in England now, but she is born and raised in San Diego. Stayed in the Bay Tower as opposed to the main building, The Marina Tower, it was much quieter & all facilities from the main building are just a short stroll along the marina pathway. All aspects from housekeeping, dining to facilities were excellent. Be prepared to pay for parking $22 per day. This seems to be the norm throughout.

<Content>I was so pleased with my stay at this hotel. I loved our view, our room, the staff, the pool; I can't say enough good things. I got a great rate from priceline.com and it was worth every penny. I got this room for my boyfriend for his birthday and we had such such a memorable time. We sat out on our balcony, drank champagne and enjoyed the stunning view of the marina. The bed was incredibly comfortable and it was difficult to get out of bed in the morning to make it for the breakfast served up on the top floor at the club lounge. The pool next to the marina was very enjoyable and we even mosied over the hammock for a relaxing siesta. I would definately go back and recommend it to people visiting!

<Title>“No power and NO problem”
<Content>As a professional pilot I get to see a LOT of hotels all across America. Just so happened that my trip ended up in San Diego at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina. That evening there was a complete power failure in the southern California area. The city and 5 million other people were without power and in the dark. As a crew for a major airline we went to check in at the hotel for the night. That is where I met Mr. Scott Hermes. I think he was the manager of the hotel. Anyway, he explained what is happening at the hotel that evening. I was very surprised to learn that just about everything was running perfectly ! The elevator was working, the staff were everywhere with handing out glow sticks, and the Restaurant was open for business! I went to my room and changed out of my work clothes. I then went back downstairs to Join the fun. The bar was open and serving cocktails, and people were in a calm and festive Atmosphere. I was a little hungry and decided to get something to eat. I waited maybe 4 minutes to see the hostess. She had a nice table for me with a nice candle lit near the water. Quickly a waiter showed up and told me of the buffet. I went to graze the food. The staff had excellent hot and cold food to offer. I had some sliced beef and some tuna salad. Both were superb. My hat is off to the entire staff of the hotel. ALL were very gracious and concerned for their guests. It was as if they do this disaster drill all the time. There were some emergency lights on at the hotel and they were more that enough to see your way and enjoy the evening. Except for my room not having any power, the entire experience was a enjoyable night to remember.

<Title>“DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR LUGGAGE”
<Content>Checked in on Sept 1 after waiting about 20 minutes in line. Went up to our room on the 6th floor & put the key in the door, opened right up, walked in & saw a laptop & luggage on the floor. We left the room immediately. We went downstairs & asked for a manager. They told us it'd be about 10 minutes and offered a front desk clerk offered to help. I explained what I concern was. What they did for me was "upgrade" me by giving me a room 1 floor higher & gave me free breakfast. I didnt want/need an upgrade, I wanted this to be noted & addressed by the manager, not to be 1 floor higher & offered the same breakfast 3 days in a row. Had I not already paid for the hotel through Priceline, I would not have stayed there. I made sure we left our valuables in the car. I will not be Priceline'ing a "4 Star" hotel in the SDdowntown area again.

<Title>“Would not recommend this hotel!!”
<Content>Location of hotel is very inconvenient for activities. Sheraton should provide a shuttle to downtown area and other places, not just the airport. Unable to walk to anything and felt like they know that and therefore charge outrageous prices for drinks and foods. Room was just okay. Cleaning Service was extremely slow and hallways were not always clean.

<Content>I stayed at this hotel for the first time with my wife and small children for an intended 5 day stay in San Diego to visit the tourist spots. Unfortunately, my kids became very ill the 2nd day of our stay so we needed to leave and head back to Los Angeles. The hotel was fantastic about our circumstance refunding the remaining days of our reservations with no penalty and allowing for a very late check out. Although I probably would select another hotel next time better suited for families, it was obvious that this is a very good business hotel and I will definately be returning. Also, a big thank you to Julia and Hayley for their great service on that troubling Friday morning.

A fridge in room would be a great addition. Nice pool and hot tub area. Larger bay tower facilities available to use to all guests. Five minute walk away. There is no bar and grill that is open all day in bay tower. Opens periodically in the evening. Bus stop is a ten min walk and its only ten minutes to downtown. 15$in a cab to downtown. The extras in this hotel are very expensive. Parking $20 per night,movies,mini bar etc. Removing points for no wifi in each room and the lack of a always open bar/grill. Wifi only available in lobby.

<Title>“Nice Views, Poor Service - Bay Tower”
<Content>I stayed in the Bay Tower for a friend's wedding from August 25-28. First of all, they messed up the reservation I made through Hotels.com. I specifically requested the Bay Tower, but for some reason gave me the Marina Tower. Luckily, they were able to put me back in the Bay Tower. This also happened to my friend. The rooms themselves were clean & pretty spacious. They had nice views of the water and the marina. The service at this hotel was horrible. The night before I arrived, I called to ask if the workstations had MS Office. They could not provide an affirmative answer. Only after I tweeted SPG did I get a firm answer (which is "yes" by the way). Every time my friends would call the lobby, the phone would ring endlessly -- literally. Sometimes, they wouldn't answer. I also signed up for green service, meaning they don't clean your room unless you specifically ask. Well, on Friday night, after I got through to the lobby after at least 8 rings, they said they'd remove me from green service and get my room cleaned on Saturday. Well -- that certainly didn't happen. That was just me. My friend, who was getting married, had a cocktail hour at BTL, the lounge in the Bay Tower, on Friday night. They tried to close early on her because they were shorthanded and the bartender had to get home to attend to a personal matter. I feel sorry for the bartender, but this is my friend's wedding! They have the reception in this very hotel and have a bunch of family/friends staying here. Provide a little service! The Marina Tower pool area is much larger and nicer than the one at Bay Tower. If you like to run, there is a nice path right outside the Bay Tower right by the water that you can run. Overall, if you don't mind shoddy service, this hotel will do.

<Title>“Nice, conveniently near airport, but hold onto your wallet!”
<Content>The staff was welcoming, and the hotel was nice. The room was a great size with balcony, and overall a decent place to stay (there are 2 hotels and we were at the marina side). During the day it was a little loud, but this is to be expected being near the airport. My biggest gripe about the stay was being nickle & dimed for everything. Make sure to read the fine print! Two things to be aware of: 1) Not only are the items in the stocked fridge overpriced like usual, you will be charged a 20% stocking fee and taxes on top of the listed price. So a can of Coke listed at $4.50 is really $5.50. 2) It's pretty archaic to use anything other than your cell phone these days, but use the phone in your room at your own risk!!! My wife was feeling under the weather so she stayed in the room while I took my daughter to check out a college she is interested in attending this fall. My wife wanted to check on us but couldn't find her cell so she used the room phone instead...her 2 calls that went straight to voicemail cost us $30!!! I can definitely afford to pay the $35.50 here, but it's the way we were charged that doesn't sit well with me. Charging 12 pack prices for a single can of soda and feeling obligated to add a re-stocking fee and tax on top seems ridiculous. And although the card next to the phone says in small print that direct dialed calls will be charged AT&T operator assisted prices, they forgot to mention "bend over and look out!" But if you don't use the room phone and make sure to read all of the fine print, it was a decent place. We didn't get a chance to use the pool, but we looked at the pool area and it looked nice and was clean. Although I wouldn't rule it out entirely, we probably won't be back and will check out another property next time we're in town.

<Title>“overpriced & in a rather inconvenient location”
<Content>There are 2 sections of this hotel & they are not close together. There was an error with my room type on check in, but a representative fixed the error without too much trouble, other than my having to reload all my stuff back into my car & drive to the other section of the hotel. While they claim to be pet friendly, they aren't as you cannot leave your pet in the room while you go to dinner, etc There is no fridge or microwave, but there is an exhorbitantly-priced motion-sensor minibar--$4.25 for a candy bar that normally costs 75 cents, $5.25 for a 16 oz gatorade, etc There is no wireless in the rooms, just wired internet for $15.99/24hrs. There is free wireless & a guest computer in the lobby. The food is way overpriced & not even very good. The chicken fettucini was terrible--just ordering that from room service without any beverages was $21 for food + automatic 19% gratuity + $3 room service fee + tax. If I wasn't so tired, I never would have ordered from that menu! And if you want breakfast, it $17 + all the above fees for 2 eggs, toast & bacon; coffee would be an extra $6-7 Parking was $22/night The view from the Bay Tower is very nice on the Bay side-- downtown San Diego, the Bay Bridge & lots of sailboats. The price I paid for the room was good because I booked thru AAA, but the mess up with the room type was supposedly due to booking thru another site & not directly on the Sheraton's site-- well, gee, other hotels all over the world seem to be able the handle bookings from sites like Travelocity & AAA....why can't the Sheraton ensure that the correct room is booked?

<Title>“Great place for the family!”
<Content>We decided to stay here because of the positive comments we read and it did not disappoint! We were impressed with the spaciousness of the room and my daughters (5 and 3 years old) immediately went out on the balcony to check out the view. I recommend requesting the Marina view in the upper floors. The only downside to this stay is the cost of parking which is $22 per day or $30 for valet. Also, we were here during the weekday and found it difficult to find parking so I can't imagine how it would be on a busy weekend. Overall, it was a fun family trip...pool was nice, clean, and warm. They have a fitness room and small gameroom for table tennis and pool. Oh, forgot to mention that they give you an option to be "green" by opting out of getting room serviced in exchange for $5 voucher which we used for Starbucks...totally worth it since you can call housekeeping anytime for more towels or amenities.

<Title>“Wouldn't come back, but not all bad”
<Content>My son and I decided to book a last minute "staycation" in downtown San Diego for a night so we could enjoy some relaxation by the pool. We booked on priceline and got the Sheraton SD Hotel and Marine for $81, plux tax, approximately $95 - NOT BAD! If I had paid the $169 rate plus tax, this would have been 2 stars for my liking. Valet - very nice and quick, but $30. Seriously? Are we in NY or SF? You can self park for $22. Check-inand Room- Again very nice, but slow. Although, the girl was new. Because I am a Starwood preferred guest, we were upgraded to the 10th floor overlooking the Marina and the pool which was excellent. The room was adequate the balcony was wonderful. I loved waking up in the morning, reading the paper and sipping on coffee while the sun broke thru the morning cloud layer, truly a fabulous way to start the day! I will say it was a long walk to the ice machine and there were no robes (which is unusual for preferred rooms in most hotels) neither were a big deal. Pool - It was right on the bay and in my opinion beautiful. Not because the pool is that great, but because how can you not love being on a pool, with great weather and on the water? From a nine year old perspective, "it sucked". Although, he seemed to enjoy it from the first two hours. But, soon became bored because there was no deep water, slide or other attractions to keep him busy. There were mostly younger kids here, but for a one or two night vacation, perfectly adequate for any age. Pool side service - Was sporatic. It took about twenty minutes to get a menu (2pm) and another twenty to come back for our order. But, once we ordered, the food was very quick and the service was friendly and very accomodating. The food is a mixed bag, my sons pizza was $12 (I think) and was a medium cheese pizza which was way above the standard I am use to for hotel pizzas. He ate half for lunch and the other half for dinner. GREAT VALUE!!!! I ordered a a lemon drink which was awful, but I ordered it that way, so my bad. I was hungry and ordered the fish burrito which was terrible, I couldn't eat it. In all fairness, I was raised in SD and we are home of the Fish Taco, so I should have known better. Oh well. Game Room - Game room, hmmmm. Not exactly what we expected, but turned out ok. The "game room" was a room inside the gym that had a wii in it with not really anything games other than the standard package. Also, the parents need to be in the room supervisng the kids at all times (I get that), but wasn't really how I wanted to spend the day, so we moved on to upstairs. This was FABULOUS! My friend joined me at the bar for a glass of vino while my son played the complimentary Xbox with kids that were coming into the lobby (he was 10 feet from me). This entertained him for two hours and he made new friends. Tapatini Tapas & Martini Bar - I have mixed reviews on this. Scott was attentive and was good with all the clients. There seems to be a mix of regulars here which is nice. They come in for dinner and drinks from their boats. My one complaint which is HUGE is the food. Scott recommended the beef skewers, which I was not in the mood for. His second recommendation was the scallops. I should have known better not to order a scallop tapa from a hotel bar - dumb on me. The scallops were good size, 3 on the plate with I believe walnuts and currants on the bottom, a ton of them. It was super sweet, totally gross and the scallops were rubber. I took one bite, disgusting. But, I took a sip of wine and tried another small bite - even more disgusting. The scallops sat in front of me for an hour until I paid the check. Really? I put my napking over them and my fork and knife, isn't this a subtle enough hint to take them from me and maybe ask me if I want something else? Guess not. My son was having such a good time with one of his new friends I asked them if they would like dessert. They both ordered the apple tart and Hagan Daaz icecream. They were like $11 or $12 each. I'm find with that, but neither of them had more than a bite of the tart and said it was too much crust. I tasted it, yep, not awful, but definitely not worth the money. I didn't complain about that either. As long as my son is happy, I am happy! Here is the funny thing though - when I said it was time to go, neither the new friend or the friends dad thanked either Alec or I for the dessert or said goodbye.....really? Here is why I probably wouldn't stay at the hotel again, but only because I am addicted to my computer and the internet. No wi-fi in the rooms and you have to pay $11.95 to be tethered to the desk to get internet there. The positive is it is absolutely free downstairs and it is very good and a wonderful seating area that even provides computers. If you are on vacation here, this should not be a drawback. Overall, service is 4 stars, food is 1 star and location 3. Happy travels!

<Title>“Nice grounds and view, somewhat isolated”
<Content>We were excited to stay at the Sheraton--the clip they had on their website where they were featured on the Today show made the place look fantastic. We were a little disappointed, though. Our first room was so far away from the lobby, and we had a baby and all our gear to haul. The room itself seemed a little shabby. The pool areas, view of the marina, and the grounds were very nice, though. Our second room was easier to get to and had a better view. We had to wait in line for quite awhile to check in/out and it seems they could have used more staff. I did like their on-site laundry facility and computers/printer/internet access. Overall, I thought the place was a bit pricey for the amenities.

<Title>“Pretty nice hotel.”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina Aug 24th - Aug 29th. I reserved the room about 2 months prior for approx $89 per night on some type of manager's special. When you enter the main lobby, it is the second floor. We stayed on the second floor. Decent 2 bed/room. Bathroom was clean! We had a balcony, but it looked out over the parking lot. Not so great, but the price was good. A better view might have cost a lot more. The big swimming pool was warm. The hot tub was good size. On Friday night, the hotel set up a movie screen so that both the hot tub and swimming pool could watch a movie. That was neat. I have never watched a movie while swimming before. We ate in the hotel restuarant one night. Very expensive. Checking in and checking out were no problem. Plenty of staff, no big lines to wait in. The hotel is walking distance to the airport. I was concerned about the airplane noise. I discovered that anywhere in San Diego you could here the airplane noise; Sea World, San Diego Zoo, downtown, the beach. I consider myself to be a light sleeper. The airplane noise did not wake me up at night. If I was already awake, I could hear the muffled noise from the airplanes. But the airplanes did not wake me up. I saw a sign at the hotel that said parking was $30 per night. We used the free shuttle from the airport to the hotel for checking in and out. During the stay, we used the MTS (San Diegos bus system). A $5 ticket to ride all day on several different buses including the trolley system. The closest bus stop was at the airport. After the first day, it was pretty easy to figure out the bus system. Oh yah, our room had this refrigerator that had juices, pop, and food items in it. $4.00 for a candy bar! Needless to say we did not buy anything. All in all, a pretty good place to sleep at night and do some swimming.

<Title>“Impressed”
<Content>Stayed for 4ngts as part of a California vacation. Initial thoughts were it was too far out but soon realised that this was very much a positive thing and that the hotel is actually central to all the major tourist attractions as you really need a car to do all. We booked the Club Level which I would highly recommend. You get a beautiful room on the top floor with amazing views which ever side of the hotel you are on. You also get access to the Club Lounge giving complimentary contintental breakfast. Free bottles of water, snacks, free Internet access and printing. Our room was very close to the airport but had excellent soundproofing so we were not disturbed by it. Hotel feels and looks clean and contemporary with a nautical theme present. Pool also nice but no shade so didn't use. Staff were helpful and pleasant. Overall excellent value for money and would definitely stay again

<Content>On family holiday driving through California and passing San Diego for a few nights decided to try Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina as recommended whilst staying at a Westin hotel. Booked through Expedia and just a couple of points as I thought it was one hotel from the photos on the Sheraton and Expedia websites. On arriving at the marina tower 1380 Harbour Island Drive was advised we were booked (and had booked) in the Bay tower passing Carbrillo Isle Marina 1450 H I Drive. On arriving at the bay tower little dissappoined, as I viewed it as a different hotel , about 400 metres plus entrance to entrance bay tower to the marina tower. Booked deluxe room, but I found to be ordinary type room. Bay tower only 12th floor are suites. Buffet breakfast very ordinary in the Bay tower. Also should have checked fees as 22 dollars per day parking, close to airport and informed by reception car park run by different company to Sheraton and fees not negotiable for those staying at hotel (cost me 66 dollars). Good location for old town. I'll give Sheraton a miss on my next visit to San Diego!

<Content>Although we stayed at this hotel for 1 night, it was an amazing experience.The hotel is very close to the airport and the views are awesome. Select a room with a city, marina and a bay view and watch the view from a higher floor. The hotel staff are friendly and this is undoubtedly one of the best hotels we have stayed in recent times.

<Title>“Decent and kid-friendly”
<Content>I was here for two nights this July. This huge hotel is basically for tourists, particularly tourists with children, so don't stay here if you don't like lots of kids running around the place and in the pool. The service was pretty friendly and efficient. Unfortunately, the rooms are kind of old and everything in the room shows its age, but the hotel is pretty reasonably priced so you get what you pay for. The assistant booking my trip neglected to put in my Starwood Platinum status and I checked-in quite late and the hotel was very full, so I was unable to get a suite upgrade. But the receptionist was very nice and scrambled to get me an upgraded room on very short notice, so I appreciated the effort. I also got access to the club/lounge, which is quite large and gives a lot of selections for breakfast. I also think they had crab cake appetizers during dinner time, which gets extra credit in my book as I can't eat enough of them. If I ever travel with kids, I would probably come back here.

<Title>“Decent SD Hotel near airport and marina. Beware of extras!”
<Content>Sheraton Marina is a decent property--know that is a large hotel, with two towers and a Lanai building-think lots of guests, weddings, events and two packed pools. Location is great--very close to downtown and the Gaslamp, also very convenient to Point Loma and even Sea World in Mission Beach/Bay. We were upgraded by the friendly SPG front desk to the Lanai property. Our ground room had a nautical motif--room was adequate, seemed clean and we had a small (dirtier) patio. There was no wireless internet in our Lanai room. Beds were comfortable; room was slightly loud--our unrelated connecting room had some loud moments. Room service meal was good, came quickly and overall staff was attentive. One thing to warn potential visitors: we did incur numerous extra charges. Internet was ~$20 per day per device. Thus, with two computers and logging in both days (via hardline ethernet), charges were over $80 incremental to our room rate. Throw in $22/day self-parking fee, a decent but overpriced restaurant, and good, fast room service (and a late-night minibar $16 beer), our extras doubled our room rate. Obviously, not specifically the hotel's fault: they were clear about these fees up-front. But, if price is a factor and you have certain expectations of how you stay at hotels, then consider these extras. Overall, a decent hotel in a great location.

There always seemed to be someone greeting us in the lobby which was a nice touch. Rooms were clean and well kept. I'm hoping that our company books San Diego as a business meeting again so we can stay there soon. Great job all around!

<Title>“Picturesque resort in a convenient location”
<Content>We were in San Diego for the Americas Finest City Half Marathon and 5k Run and had a room on the ninth floor of the Marina Tower. The room was clean, nice and decorated in a nautical theme. Harbor Island, Point Loma, the marina and the airport could be seen from the balcony. The hotel is very convenient, located adjacent to downtown and the airport. The hotel staff is friendly and courteous. The hotel grounds are nicely maintained and landscaped and the pool areas are very inviting. The only thing I did not like was the $20 charge for parking. The hotel has facilities for conventions. It was the host hotel for the marathon expo and also had other events at the time so it was very busy. After paying the $20 parking fee, were had much difficulty finding a parking spot, day and night. Other than the parking hassles, this is definitely a recommended hotel.

<Title>“DONT STAY HERE IF YOU LIKE CLEAN ROOMS AND GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!”
<Content>I honestly wish I had the option of giving no stars for this hotel because Iâ€™m shocked and appalled at the physical condition of it and at horrid customer service. We booked this hotel way in advance because we were in San Diego for a conference. The only reason why we booked at this hotel was because the conference was being held in it. When we went to check in, they told us that we were staying at their sister hotel which was Â¼ of a mile away and require shuttle transportation. I figured we had just gone to the wrong place, and that the conference was being held at the sister hotel that they were sending us to, but I soon found out I was wrong. We spent one night at the sister hotel, and we were horrified at the physical condition of the room. The next day we were moved to the bigger hotel where the conference was being held, and had the displeasure of experiencing their â€œcustomer serviceâ€�. We called asking for hangers because we were staying there for 6 nights. They gave us an attitude and then took over an hour to get the hangers to us. The food was overpriced, which is to be expected at a hotel, but if youâ€™re going to charge me double, at least make sure the food is worth it. It was not. My chicken was cold, hard, and dry, and my friend was given a cheeseburger with no bun (and no sheâ€™s not on the Atkinâ€™s diet). The Restaurant Serves were rude and one even rolled his eyes when we asked him for napkins. Guests would leave their trays in the hallway after they were done with their food and drinks, and they would be left out there for days; room service did not walk the halls. The two glasses that we took a picture of were there for 4 days!!!! In fact, my husband repeatedly put them in the middle of the hallway so that someone would pick them up, and instead they were moved back up against the wall instead of being taken in to be cleaned. When we dialed 0 for the operator, the phone would ring and ring, but no one bothered to answer it. The charge for parking was ridiculous ($22), as was the internet ($17). As soon as we walked in, we were greeted with a commercial boasting that Sheraton spent $6 billion to renovate their hotels across the country, and I guess weâ€™re paying for it. I think if they could charge us for the air we breathed, they would have. Iâ€™m really wondering where this money went to. Our experience was unacceptable. We were so shocked that we took a photo log. This is not a cheap motel, but a resort. I was disappointed and disgusted. We paid a lot of money to go to this conference, and spent a few extra days there as a mini vacation. This is definitely not what I had in mind. You can take a look at the pictures, but here are some of the highlights: 1) The wallpaper was stained and falling apart. In one spot, there was blood on the wall. 2) The showerhead was coming off the wall, falling apart, and water was dripping. 3) The bathroom was not clean. 4) The lampshade was stained and had a hair from a previous guest still on it. 5) The electrical outlets were loose, old, broken, and corroded. 6) The AC would turn off all by itself, minutes after we turned it on. There was no way for us to tweak it and let the room cool down to what we were comfortable with. 7) The patio outside was disgusting and had not been cleaned. 8) The telephone did not work. 9) There were cups of coffee, but no coffee maker in the room - cofemaker was very dirty. 10) The baseboards were completely banged up. 11) The sprinklers on the ceiling were rusted, as were the AC vents. 12) The pool area was not cleaned at night, so we could see trash and the towels all over the pool area. 13) There was dust everywhere, especially built up in the vents. 14) The layout of the room was difficult. Weâ€™re not dumb people and we work in real estate. We couldnâ€™t figure out where to turn on the lights. The towels were under the sink and completely unreachable. In my past hotel experiences, the towels are always either in the shower or right next to the shower so that they are readily available.

<Title>“Beautiful location...”
<Content>I was initially surprised that we were so far away from the heart of San Diego. Turns out our location was great. Everything we needed was on the property, and just a mile away was an entire shopping center with Trader Joe's and plenty of little restaurants. The kids loved their choices of pools too. The hotel restaurant was outrageously delicious. My complaint would be that the rooms did not feel so clean. I noticed there were dogs in other rooms and our carpet felt a bit dirty. I did not allow my kids to sit on the floor. Also the restroom had some issues, which the hotel plumber was fixing for quite some time. The hotel was nice enough to compensate us slightly, but it was still a little gross and inconvenient. Overall, I think it's at a wonderful location and I would go back in a heartbeat. The views were spectacular.

<Content>What can I say of a place where, from the very beginning to the end, everything was absolutely perfect? We stayed for 5 nights after a wonderful bargain booking made last april with Expedia. We were in the club lounge at the 12 floor with the possibility to have a great buffet breakfast and an every afternoon Hors d'oeuvre. The room (double queen) was clean and comfortable for a party of four like us (with two young kids) and the view from it gorgeous over the Bay and the pool. The pool is also a plus and really relaxing with its spa. We really enjoyed our stay and we'd like to be there again sooner or later. The only thing I can say could have been better.....is that maybe 20 dollars a day for the parking it's a bit expensive......

<Content>The first room I got was on the ground floor. When I went on the balcony to work, I found it littered with garbage. I requested another room. This one faced the marina and was nicer. Other issues: - On several occasions, I was unable to reach anyone at the front desk. - For early risers, you should know that the restaurant only opens at 6:30. - The morning staff at the restaurant weren't very friendly. And they didn't appear to be too happy to be there.

<Title>“Won't be back!!”
<Content>We were at a conference and booked 2 months in advance, when we arrived at 9pm we aere told our room was already sold and we had to go to their other tower in a handicapped, dirty room with only one bed even though we booked a 2 bed room for 2 adults and a child. Our number one problem is with the front desk staff. The women that helped us both at check-in and out was rude, condescending and dismissive. Too much trouble for a mediocre hotel. Don't let them send you to their other tower it is dirty and quite a walk to the main pool and restaurants.

<Title>“A large hotel with good customer service!”
<Content>Generally we stay away from larger hotels as often they lack the personal touch, but that was not the case with The Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. Friendly front desk reception, reservation, good maid service & attentive restaurant wait staff. Rooms are nicely decorated and were clean. We did have an issue with a sheet, but called room service and they responded immediately. Common areas of the hotel are well kept, the grounds were beautifully landscaped, nice view of the harbor and yachts, clean and inviting pools. Hotel location is good, near airport, car rentals and near to downtown. Close to harbor areas, beaches, Old Town, Gaslamp District, I-5. If you have a car you will need to use hotel parking, either self parking or valet, from $22-$28 daily rates. Otherwise you will need to rent a car or take taxi. Public transporation is not close. No stores, shops and restaurants within walking distance but hotel does have several good restaurants including a Starbucks. Hotel is quiet and relaxing and we enjoyed our stay and were not disappointed in our choice. We would recommend this hotel and would stay again in the future.

<Title>“Almost a "5", and Dog Friendly, too!”
<Content>We drove to San Diego for a few days, and we brought our well behaved spaniel. Simply a perfect place for a getaway. We had a wonderful view of the harbor, and an extremely comfortable room with a king-sized bed. We paid the extra $40/day Club Fee; well worth it for the view from the 12th floor, the quiet, and especially the club access--free breakfast buffet (not cooked), free hors d'oeuvres in the evenings, free water bottles and free internet access. The area is right across from the airport but surprisingly quiet, and there are beautiful walking paths all around the harbor for a happy dog to enjoy with her family. Our only negatives are the $22.00/day parking fee (apparently average for the area) and the fact that they Locked Up the Walkways in the evening, (a security issue?) so after the pleasant evening walk, you have to walk twice as far just to get back in. All-in-all, a really nice place.

<Title>“Well priced, great location and clean”
<Content>Nice hotel right down the street from the airport. Very clean, great pool, right on the harbor. Free shuttle to and from the airport. Good value. I would stay there again. The only negative is the room was a bit small.

<Title>“Isolated and Overpriced”
<Content>We just stayed 5 nights at the Sheraton San Diego on the Harbor and it was not worth it. Everything was overpriced (bottle of water in the gift shop was $4, omlet at their restaurant was $17, parking was $30/night). Since we didn't have a rental car, we felt isolated. There is nothing around there but the harbor. The only decent restaurant on the island itself is Island Prime / C Level (which is about a mile walk from the hotel). We were unable to take a taxi since we had a 6 month old. I rented a car for each day that we wanted to travel somewhere, then returned it the same night to avoid paying the $30 parking fee (zoo and sea world). The room was decent, but the goose down in the pillows and bedspread were shedding everywhere, creating dust in the room. We had a nice view from our balcony of the harbor. If you don't have a car, I suggest the gaslamp district. If you're more into Sea World, then stay around mission bay.

<Title>“Kids LOVED this hotel !”
<Content>We stayed in the 3-story non-tower rooms and was pleasantly surprised. I guess if I didn't have a beautiful view of the Marina it would not have been so nice. Mind you, our last stay in San Diego was at the Hyatt Mission Bay. The rooms were clean however wish the beds were queens vs. full size. My 8 and 6 year olds LOVED the pool and nightly movie. They also loved the WII room in the fitness room which was a nice touch because it allows parents to workout while the kids are safely playing in the WII room. Kids also played ping pong and pool. There is also a nice walking trail along the Marina. Although we didn't do any water activities, it was all there conveniently located on the Marina. We did do the Pirate Adventure Tour and would recommend it to families with young children. Cost was $30/adult and $26/kids. We are Starbucks addicts so we loved the on-site location. We ate at the breakfast buffet and it was actually pretty good except NO pancakes or waffles, which my kids were disappointed with. Otherwise, a nice selection. The free internet access area was great providing guests free use of about 10 computers with big computer screens. Overall, my family really enjoyed our stay here and would definately choose to stay here again.

<Title>“Loved it”
<Content>This hotel was great. We got two connecting double rooms and both rooms were very spacious for our family of five. The rooms were clean and well equiped and the view across the Marina was fantastic. We ate breakfast at a small cafe on the water front just under the hotel which was very good value. The hotel is VERY close to the airport but we did not hear any noise from there at all.

<Title>“A mixed bag”
<Content>Booked here for two nights. Arranged a club room but wasnt entirely sure we got one as it wasnt on the club floor and we had to ask twice for confirmation of the club lounge detail/arrangements. Big luxurious and very busy with holiday makers and conference guests in full turnout. Although hard to find real fault, we didnt really enjoy this hotel. Found the restuarants and bars very expensive and the staff not particularly helpful. Location mixed. You cant walk into town from here and next time we'd pick a hotel which is closer. That said, we did go sailing on a yacht in the harbour and the Sheraton was ideal for that. VERY close to the airport but to be fair we didnt hear noise. Very plush but lacks the personal touch

<Title>“Great hotel”
<Content>We stayed with our three year old for three nights. We ended up originally in the marina tower and decided to switch to the lanai section. I know some reviewers didn't lime this section but we loved it. We had a wonderful view of the water and were right next to the Pools but the best part was no elevators to deal with which was a treat with a three year old. Room was super comy and nicely decorated. Starbucks was right there which I liked. The only thing I didn't live was the cost of parking but the service and everything else was great.

<Title>“Overall good, would stay again”
<Content>Just returned August 16th, all in all this hotel is good not quite up to the Sheraton standard though, the rooms are clean the bathroom could use a fan, and it would have been nice to have a fridge in the room, the beds were comfortable . We had a room in the Marina tower which is the bigger of the two towers we had a room facing the city/Airport which at first I thought might be an issue (noise from Airport) but actually it was not an issue you do hear airport noise whilst sitting on the balcony but when you close the door you donâ€™t hear anything, the walls had good sound insulation which is good because Iâ€™m a light sleeper and I did not experience any problems. Food is fairly expensive here we booked a package through Allegiant Air and received breakfast free everyday which was great you had the choose of buffet or menu breakfast it was good, we ate in the bar once food was ok! There are no restaurants close to the hotel so if you donâ€™t eat at the hotel you would have to go downtown which is a 10 minute drive away, if you donâ€™t have a car like us you can take the hotel shuttle to the airport then take the bus to downtown a little inconvenient but it worked. The pool is very nice lots of chairs to lounge around on they do have a pool bar which is convenient the staff do walk around to take orders, I found the food here a little greasy for my liking. The hotel does have lots of conferences here but it did not affect us to much they have a big conference centre so they are really well take care of over their own side of the hotel. The hotel front desk staff we found to be very unfriendly it seemed like they were going out of their way to help us, on the over hand housekeeping went out of their way to help you and were very friendly even though English was clearly their second language. Parking your car here is expensive $25 a night and more for valet parking however most hotels charge the same rates. It would have been nice if they had a shuttle that took you to the downtown area where you can pick up a bus or the trolley system which is very easy to get around on.

<Title>“A Pleasant Surprise”
<Content>We booked this hotel on priceline.com (4 star, Downtown). I was a little disappointed initially to see the distance to downtown and the gas lamp district. However, upon arrival was pleasantly surprised to see how easy it was to get to the beach, La Jolla & downtown. Since the hotel is right by the airport, you can follow signage and get to it easily and quickly. PRO's: We stayed in Bay Tower with awesome view of the harbor. So relaxing to sit on balcony and watch boats arrive in the evening. Comfortable bed Modern Decor My husband doesnt like coffee and loved the coffee here. Hot tub has beautiful view of harbor (pool is average at best) CON's: As discussed in other reviews airplane noise is a big factor if you choose this hotel. It did quiet down between 10 pm and 5 am. Be careful in the parking lot, it is not well lit at night and the cement blocks go between instead of in front of cars - dangerous! For those wanting to go car free, too far to major attractions. Slow elevator

<Title>“Some pros and some cons”
<Content>I stayed here for a conference. The hotel seems to be able to handle a large number of guests; there were 1,000 present at the conference and also some little league baseball teams. The lobby, business center, and fitness center never seemed crowded, but the Starbucks had long lines and the pub restaurant was busy, understaffed, and hot. I stayed in the Marina Tower. Check-in service was prompt, courteous, and friendly. I can say the same for the parking valet and concierage. My room was very clean and comfortable.The bed was great, and room service was reliable. Unfortunately I was unable to get a room with much of a view, but the 5th floor was quiet and I was never bothered by noise from the airport or other quests. Also, the conference facilities were great with prompt attention from the tech team. So on the plus side--very nice room, clean and quiet, and overall wonderful service. Now, the cons--as noted by other reviewers--the hotel is isolated. If you want to see San Diego, you will need to rent a car, and if you rent a car, you will have to pay the outrageous (in my view) parking fees--$22 per day for self park, $28 for valet. I would prefer to stay some place where I could walk to restaurants and shopping. Secondly, in-room internet is costly, although wi-fi is free in the lobby. Finally, the food and drinks in the on site restaurants were mediocre and way over priced, and the restaurants and bar always seemed to be understaffed. I spent two nights checking out restaurants in the Gaslight District. I would recommend taking a cab rather than driving, as parking was scarce and very $$$. Also, the evening scene there is not very family friendly. Try Fred's for Mexican or one of the reasonably priced Italian restaurants.

<Title>“An Average Three Star”
<Content>This is an old tired property that tries to pass as a 4 star hotel. The Lanai Building portion of this property offers a two star experience. Seriously, the folks at Starwood need to downgrade to a lesser brand and lower the rates. On the positive side, the staff was friendly and helpful and the lobby was well appointed. The problem is the room, hall ways, elevators look and feel like a Motel 6. If you are paying less than $100, then you are getting value for your money. There are much better options closer to downtown.

<Title>“Bay Tower = 3 Stars”
<Content>Stayed here three days for a conference. The hotel is acutally two Sheraton hotels - the Marina Tower and the Bay Tower, which are about a 5 minute walk apart from each other. I was in the Bay Tower...which is a 3 star hotel that's trying really hard to be a 4 star. And it looks like it's trying. The hotel overall is decent - the rooms were lacking in my opinion. Nothing was by any means impressive. I think the Marina tower must be a lot nicer - at least the lobby and amenities make it appear that way. I can't say that I was ever in a Marina tower room, I can only assume that they're nicer than those in the Bay Tower. The rooms were loud, I could hear doors slamming and toilets flushing at all hours. I'm a light sleeper so this was especially irritating. The rooms had that moist, Mexico feel to them...always just a little bit damp. That has a lot to do with being right on the marina, but when I first checked in, the AC was completely off. That doesn't help either. Overall, the room was very clean, housekeeping came everyday. Staff was friendly, which always goes a long way in my opinion. Only two elevators, which are slow. I ended up just taking the stairs most of the time. Meeting space is nice, lots of rooms/ballrooms between the two towers. Parking is not free and neither is internet access. If you drive, keep your room key handy in the car. You'll need it to enter AND exit the parking lots. (I chunked it into my purse on multiple occasions and had to dig for it while cars lined up behind me. Sorry cars.) I think parking was $11/day and internet was $12/day. It added up though. Also, when you get there, the first hotel you'll see is the Marina tower. You won't see the Bay Tower. So, valet the car or just leave it running at the valet station - do NOT park - go in and check in. There's a chance you're in the other tower and lugging stuff back and forth is annoying. For the nightly rate, I think it could be nicer. The views are good - either of the marina or the bay. It's definitely in a GREAT location relative to the airport; only a couple of miles away. I'd say good location overall actually, it's within about 5 miles of everything: Fashion Valley, the Gaslamp District, Little Italy, etc. Also, great running trails just outside the hotel...run along the marina, watch the boats, it's pretty key for runners. Room Service food was surprisingly good, however. Recommend the crab cakes. Watch out for the service charges, they caught me off guard. And if this is your first visit to San Diego, take a sweater and pajama pants. I was cold pretty much every night.

<Title>“No Redeeming Qualities”
<Content>Check-in took 45 mins., then my room wasn't ready at check-in time, was offered a room in another bldg. "right next door" or a two-hr. wait for my room. The bldg. "next door" is actually about 1/2 mile away and has very limited services, internet service is really poor and only available in certain parts of the hotel, no pool, no coffee shop (when I asked about a Starbucks in the bldg. they referred me to the in-room coffee). There is a shuttle between the main hotel and the satellite hotel......but it takes you to the main hotel via the airport!! Very poor service all-round and obvious it starts with the management. By the way, this hotel is right next to the airport so you will need earplugs if you still decide to give it a try.

<Title>“Our anniversary get away.”
<Content>This trip was a gift from our children and spouses for our 40th Wedding Anniversary. Don't let our age bracket influence you in a negative way. We saw all different ages that stayed here and everyone seemed to be smiling. The room was large and very clean. No complaints at all. The Sheraton is about one mile from the airport and consists of two separate buildings, a five minute walk between them. We were told upon arrival by a cab driver that the Marina building was for the younger crowd and the Bay Tower building was a little more relaxed. The only complaint we had was the Starbucks was in the "other" building. We didn't rent a car the first two days. By the third day, we rented a car as the cab rides were getting expensive. There's a lot to keep you occupied: Old Town, Balboa Park, Coronado Island, USS Midway, San Diego Zoo, Littly Italy for dinner, Boat rides, Seaport Village to people watch and coastal drives. Oh, and Tijuana. Keep an open mind and enjoy the vitality there.

<Content>Nice hotel, clean and comfortable. Restaurant staff courteous and fun. When we checked in we asked for confirmation that parking was included in our room rate (booked through Virgin) and we were told it was. This was very, very clear. When we checked out we were asked whether we wanted a receipt. When we asked what for, we were told the $88 parking charge. When we told what happened at check in we were told "she [the lady at check in] is new". An excuse? Eventually the charge was removed but it stained our stay. The attitude was unhelpful and obstructive. Avoid this hotel unless you enjoy a fight. Would have given it 4 or 5 stars but for car park charge con. Beware.

<Title>“You've got to be kidding”
<Content>We booked this hotel via Priceline.com for $85.00 per night. When we arrived, the parking attendent checked his list and we were told to go down the street to the Sheraton "Bay View" to check in. Right away, I was dissappointed as I wanted to stay at the Sheraton "Resort" with nice pools and a marina to walk around. Since I belonged to their points club, the desk agent gave us an upgrade to a higher story room where the views (which were absolutely beautiful) would be better. It's a good thing that the patio had chairs as the room itself was a dive. Barely a 2 star place. Upholstered sofa and two chair/hassocks were stained and filthy, the aircondition duct was hanging down from the ceiling, walls so thin I could hear the people in the room above us going to the bathroom. Self-Parking was $28.00 per day; Valet was $32.00 WiFi was $17.00 per day. THe next day when checking out, I wanted to speak to the Manager - unfortunately, another desk agent told me that all the management people were housed at the "Resort" The best thing was Deana at the front desk - a real people person with excellent skills.

<Title>“Nice property, service needs refinements”
<Content>Okay, so we got to the hotel early and we didn't really expect our room to be ready yet. They offered to call us when it was ready but we waited to 3PM, check-in time, and there was no call. Back to the long line at the desk. Long since there was only one person waiting on guests checking in. In fact, we rarely saw more than one or two people at the reception desk, therefore there was always a long line of tired travelers. Our room was still not ready so we were given a room with the city view, which is very nice but faces the airport and freeway so is substantially noisier. Back to the line for another 10-15 minute wait. Can we wait for our original room, we ask? There was no record of our original request. Okay, so we head out for dinner, the parking gate was not working properly. Back to the line. They explained there's something wrong with the computers and to just use the assistance button at the gate. Later after dinner, can't get into our room. Back to the line. My husband gets two new cards and we are assured they work. Breakfast in the club room the next day. Can't get up with our cards. Back to the line. Computers still malfunctioning and we still can't get out of the parking lot, the lot for which we paid $22/day. My recommendation, Mr. Manager, hire an IT person and some more desk assistance. The bar in the hotel had some very good drinks, food and service. Although when people were 3 deep at the bar, the bartender had to leave the bar and find someone to help him. You guys could use an extra hand at the bar, too.

<Content>Overall large rooms in the Bay tower where we stayed-( called in advanced and requested this tower as per other reviews here) Got a great deal through price line, HOWEVER- they treat you like you shouldnt even be there. Treated the " Gold" customers as such, but the " price line" was not only brought up to me, but the front staff were quite snobbish. While the restaurant and cleaning staff were fantastic, the desk staff should be run through a course again...it was quite brutal. Sure glad i dont ask alot of front desk staff....will never stay at Sheraton property again. The location, while it may seem far away for visiting, was actually very easy to get to local attractions-Zoo/Seaworld, etc....expensive parking but it is becoming normal at higher end hotels. Overall I'd recommend if you get a name your own price...but I wouldnt pay full price for this hotel. I got it for $100/night BTW

<Content>I recently stayed in this hotel with my wife for 6 days attending a real estate conference and stayed over several additional days to enjoy the facility. On the day before my departure, I lost my digital camera. I left word with the front desk to watch out for this camera since it had many of my business and well as personal photos on it. One day after my departure and having returned home, I was thrilled to hear from them that a similar camera had been turned in. I had several conversations with Nicolas confirming that it was in fact my camera. He was kind enough to make arrangements to send the camera back to me. He was very courteous and helpful in taking the time to help me. We really enjoyed our stay and were very impressed by a number of the employees. We look forward to returning some day.

<Title>“Hotel and location more oriented to business clients but clean with large rooms”
<Content>This hotel is more oriented towards the business traveller, evident obviously by the location by the airport, but also the excessive internet and parking charges. The parking charge is $22.00, per night! How ridiculous!! The internet was about $11.99 per 24 hours, but you could get two free hours if you were near the lobby, or in the foyer of the marina tower there were PCs and I think you could get on them for free. Excessive extras I believe. Despite this, the hotel has very big, nice rooms. We were in the Bay Tower, with a view on the bay side which was really nice. The balcony gets some sun around the middle of the day. It is too far to walk into the city, so a taxi or drive yourself. We drove, and got free parking in the gaslamp district, but it was on a Tuesday night and I believe free parking hard to come by at the weekends. Gym free to use. Really nice hotel, nice pool, but just a bit far out and with the extra costs on an already expensive hotel.

<Title>“Nice hotel with nothing around it”
<Content>This hotel is by the airport. The restaurants are barely adequate and you cannot walk to anything. Parking is expensive so having a car is not a great option (it is actually cheaper to park at the airport itself and use the shuttle to go between your car and the hotel). The rooms themselves are nice and the whole hotel is clean. If you miss the maid service in the morning, it is unlikely to happen later in the day. Staff was friendly and helpful. They did know the ins and outs of airport travel through Sand Diego. The convention space staff did not seem to be able to adapt quickly. Rooms were kept at a near freezing level.

<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton for the 4th of July weekend and found it to be the perfect location. The hotel is very large and has 2 large buildings that surround the marina. We had a bay front balcony that provided us a beautiful view of the San Diego Bay and an unbelievable view of the holiday fireworks. 4 simultaneous displays from one side of the bay to the other. It was amazing! The staff, the room and the amenities were very nice and accommodating.

<Title>“A nice way to be introduced to San Diego”
<Content>I liked that this wasnt right in the city, we had a rental car so that was okay for us, as I couldnt do alot of walking anyways. Be mindful its right near the airport, though it didnt bother us. We got a concierge room it had a balcony and beautiful view of the San Diego skyline. Behind the hotel is a nice marina view. Outdoor pool looked nice but we didnt get a chance to use it. Stay in the Marina tower, its definitely better situated. The concierge lounge had a complimentary continental breakfast which was perfect, included hardboiled eggs and oatmeal with usual continental fare. Appetizers from 5-8 were just so so - asst of nice cheeses, nice croissant sandwiches, but only two hot items, one was cheesesticks that were not very appetizing, I liked the mini egg rolls. The attendant there was very slow, I had to find her to give my drink order. We also bought a AAA package which included the self parking fee and gave us $50 food and beverage credit which made this a great value overall. You cannot walk easily to downtown from here, but their restaurants appeared to be quite nice onsite. I was a bit perturbed at checkout, she wasnt very nice, there was an error on my bill, she did end up taking care of it, when I thanked her she didnt even respond, I was about to complain to her manager but I had one foot out the door so I chalked it up to her having a bad morning and let it go. I found it very clean and comfortable, but would probably stay closer to the city on my next visit.

<Title>“Just OK”
<Content>Just stayed at this place this week. It was OK. The lobby was nice as is the bar. The breakfast restaurant is very expensive for the mediocre food. I thought I was in the main tower, but alas my room was in another tower which was a 500 yard walk from the main hotel. The view was nice, but the airport is just to the North so it was a bit noisy. The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. I'd look elsewhere on my next trip. San Diego has better hotels than this.

<Title>“Nickled and Dimed”
<Content>The hotel was very nice and clean.Staff was ok some of the women at the front desk came off with a bit of an attitude.My family and I stayed at the bay tower.I had no idea that the resturant/lounge was only opened for a few hours in the morning and evening.The baytower had a small pool.In all fairness its a few minute walk away from the main hotel that has all the amenaities that are listed on the website.We never expected to pay for parking at a hotel you are are paying to stay in.$22 a day.They do offer a "green" option where you get a $5 coupon good toward breakfast.What they dont mention is that a cup of coffee or juice is $4 alone.I wish they would of let us know they were more of a "business" hotel I know my family and I could of gotten more for our money elsewhere.

<Title>“As long as you have a rental car, great deal and location!”
<Content>Stayed for a week with my 20 year old daughter. We stayed on the club floor which was nice especially for breakfast daily, and ability to get bottled water anytime we wanted. Although we didn't spend a lot of time at hotel, when we did we enjoyed it! Favorite staff member....Scott, the bartender at Tapatinis for sure! He was entertaining and pleasant. We took advantage of the "green room" choice and instead of housekeeping we received $5.00 every day under our door to be used anywhere in the hotel. We still asked for extras of anything we ran low on, and always received what we needed. Only complaint is that parking is a little high.....$22.00/night is exhorbitant! and $28/night for valet was out of the question for us.

<Title>“A Tale of Two Towers”
<Content>Stayed 4 nights here the last week of July. This is a very nice hotel with two towers that are very different from each other. Depending on your tastes and needs it is important you are given a room in the appropriate tower. The main tower is called the Marina Tower. This is where you will find the main lobby, bars and restaurants. This is also where you will find Starbucks (open 5:30 for us early risers). The main pool is here as well. This is also where you will find the majority of the noise and commotion associated with a large resort like hotel. The smaller Bay tower is located a 5 minute walk away. It too has a bar and restaurant and pool, but everything in the Bay Tower is on a smaller scale. I found it to be perfect for my needs. The rooms are large and well appointed. I found my room to be clean. I asked for a higher floor and was placed on 11. My room looked down on the Marina (lots of sail boats) and also had a view of the adjacent airport. I spent a lot of time on the balcony watching the marina and airport activity. The opposite side faces the bay and some might prefer that view. If you are worried about sleeping noise the airport is quiet at night and I slept very well. I made the walk between the two towers several times a day and found that I enjoyed it very much. Had the weather been bad I might not have felt that way. I did rent a car while here and found the hotel close enough to all the attractions. You can self park your car if you want to. The Bay tower is much closer to the car park. There are 2 restaurants off the hotel property which are walkable. The first is The Lighthouse and it is very good (I highly recommend it and you will need a reservation). The second, The Boat House, is closer but I found the food and service to be terrible. This is a very nice hotel which can offer two different experiences at the same time. Just choose the tower which fits your needs and you will be happy.

<Title>“What a neat experience in a fantastic location. Resort-like.”
<Content>This was our first time to San Diego and this hotel was huge. It had two towers. It has all the amenities of a nice resort. We were there on July 4th and got to experience the fireworks right outside the hotel! What an experience. We will definitely stay here again when back in San Diego. You cannot beat the views of San Diego and the staff is eager to help meet your needs. The club lounge is extraordinary with breathtaking views of the city and bay. This hotel is reasonably priced considering other hotels in the area that have less amenities.

<Title>“Well appointed, well out of the way”
<Content>This hotel is great for a one night stop over to or from the airport. The rooms are well appointed and to the usual Sheraton standard. Internet access is extra but there is free wifi within the confines of the business centre (next to the bar). The hotel is a long way from San Diego centre though (over 2 miles and a $10 taxi ride to anywhere of signficance - although if you're on a budget you can take the free 15min frequency shuttle to the airport and then the Holiday Inn shuttle to the Holiday Inn which is at least walkable to the USS Midway and beyond that Seaport Village and downtown). The main disadvantage I found was that I was located in the annex which is a LONG way from reception (especially if you have bags etc). Obviously, as the hotel is near the airport there is some plane noise though I slept soundly.

<Title>“Very nice hotel”
<Content>We just stayed at this hotel this past weekend it was 3 adults and 4 kids (ages 4, 10 & 13) and we got an amazing rate by calling the hotel directly, and using our AAA discount. We got a rate of $119/night per room, non-refundable. They had a huge lagoon-pool overlooking the beautiful Marina. Both sides of the hotel overlooked the Marina so all rooms probably have a nice view, and the hotel and rooms were all newly renovated/updated in a nautical theme. The lunch in the sports bar off the lobby was good and the staff was helpful and friendly. Although you do have to basically drive through the airport to get to the hotel as its right in the airport area and seemed to be mainly a hotel fcatering to business travelers. If you want to go anywhere you do need to drive, but its very close to evreything - about 10 min to the Gaslamp Quarter, Old Town, etc.

<Title>“Fantastic!!! See you again next year!”
<Content>This hotel is right across from the San Diego Airport...and because it was our first time in San Diego, it was very convenient. When I booked this hotel, it was because of its proximity to the airport and the shuttle to and from it. I did not want to worry about how long it would take for me to get to the airport and be late for my flight. Reading some reviews from a different website gave me second thoughts, but I did not have to worry, because this hotel was just GREAT! The service at the front desk was great, very friendly and courteous, the valet people were very nice, too. The room was just perfect with a PERFECT VIEW of the city and the bay and the marina. We are SPG members so we got the higher floors, and the view alone was well worth the stay here. the pool, like the other reviews, was also very nice, with a spa. It wasn't busy at all, the showers were conveniently located in the gym, and they provided the towels at the poolside. Our stay here was staggard because we had to travel to another city for the weekend, so when I booked, I booked two different kinds of rooms, the last one was a studio type, which I liked very much, too. Very spacious. Although, the drain of the shower in the studio type was slow...that was the only set back, and we only stayed in it for one night, so I really didn't mind it that much. Parking was indeed steep, at $22/night, but hey, it wasn't that bad finding a spot anyway. You just had to go tot he opposite lot, everyone tends to turn right upon entering the hotel driveway, but really, there's another lot on the left side and we always found a spot to park there. And it wasn't even a long walk. So overall, I say I loved staying at this hotel and I will certainly come back! Thanks Sheraton!

<Title>“No service”
<Content>This is my second stay here and love the location. First time I was here our family loved everything about the hotel. Room was clean and well maintained, view was exceptional, and staff very pleasant. This time, the complete opposite. Room is dusty and dirty. Air conditioning unit sounds horrible with water sloshing around inside of it. Called front desk twice and was assured they would send a technician. Departed room in morning for day out in SD sunshine. Returned to room to find the a/c unit had not been touched. Received no indication, note, message, or anything that would indicate the issue was even being addresed. Poor service and unacceptable for a room they charged $250 a night for. Will avoid Sheraton from now on. Too bad because this can be a great hotel, given the right circumstance.

<Title>“Great access to airport - but feel like you are far away”
<Content>Given its proximity to the airport - you can call it an airport hotel - but it is nothing like an airport hotel. On the marina - spread out - large pool, etc. I found it very convenient for a conference I was in San Diego to attend (ADA). Loved the proximity to the marina for my morning run. It is not near the Gas Lamp/Downtown area - so you will need to cab or shuttle to get to other places. I was in the tower closer to the lobby - which I would reccommend as it looke like the other section of the hotel was a hike.

<Title>“Two towers, it just depends what's important to you!”
<Content>Lovely floral entrance/driveway and smart lobby with VERY busy Reception desk. There always seemed to be a queue of people! Internet centre (free in the lobby) then there's a Starbucks and then the main restaurant. Outside is the lagoon style pool then the lanai accommodation and they have their own pool. Well equipped fitness centre. This is all part of the Marina Tower. So if you are looking for all of those things, stay here! If you are looking for something a bit quieter, large rooms, a restaurant, standard pool but still with views, either looking towards the marina/ airport runway or city view/Coronado, then this is for you. The wireless internet is only in the lobby but is free. The restaurant serves all the major fodder for a night's hunger pangs and a small bar. Open for breakfast but I wasn't going to pay $9 for a bowl of oatmeal. Instead, on the Marina path inbetween the two hotels buildings was Papnani's convenience store and cafe, mostly geared towards the boat owners but it did me just fine! My major complaint was about the shuttle service. It's a nightmare! either there's not enough drivers or vehicles, I don't know what but it look a long time for a vehicle to turn up at the airport. There were quite a few waiting as well as Airline Crew and then getting a shuttle back again took a while because they had to locate it then send it to the building you were in!! It didn't drive round all the time like it should! The frustrating thing is, it's across the road from the airport and it is walkable but with luggage, maybe not!! If you don't have your own transport it's a bit restricting. If you opt for the Old Town Trolley Tour, once a day, it will pick up outside the Marina building, ask the Concierge! All in all, a good hotel in a lovely location. My room in the Bay Tower was big and bright with a sunny balcony! I would recommend it!

<Content>This is a very nice and clean hotel. It is right on the Marina literally accross from the street from airport, yet we didn't hear any noise. One of the quiter hotels even when busy. Water views on both sides, so no matter where your room is the view is nice. Near downtown and the Zoo. However it is pretty far south of the nicer areas like La Jolla and Del Mar.

<Title>“Awesome Hotel”
<Content>We stayed at the San Diego Marina Hotel for two nights while visiting our daughter. The Sheratonâ€™s location is just beautiful. The hotel and the rooms were outstandingly clean. The staff was very welcoming especially to our granddaughter with us. Their hospitality and genuine customer care was so refreshing. We got in very late, because of airplane problems, so it was so nice to have the staff so accommodating and pleasant. The pool area was wonderful, we used the larger pool all the time but there even was another pool at the hotel. Great pool games for children. The food was excellent, breakfast and eating lunches at the pool (they even had steel drums playing one day, which was great). While all the staff was friendly, Ronnie, the food manager, was awesome! He is probably one of the nicest and friendliest people there. Thanks Ronnie for making our stay at the Sheraton so memorable. We highly recommend this hotel and we will be back again to stay.

<Title>“Beautiful location”
<Content>Stayed here for a conference so this review won't speak much in terms of value since the company paid and I'm not sure how much the room was. But in terms of location, it was great! Great jogging/biking paths from the hotel to Seaport Village (3 miles) and downtown (worth the walk if you don't mind walking). I rented a bike from the hotel (great deal!) and biked all around Sunset Cliffs and Pt. Loma (~5 miles to the Pacific coastline for amazing views!). My room itself wasn't the best. It was ground level and hence, had to have my curtains drawn all day, leading to a dark and dreary room. The pool was nice, with hammocks, and a recreation center. Not many breakfast/snack options though. Starbucks had the monopoly there, but there's also a sandwich/cafe shop midway between the Bay and Marina towers. Excellent location for taking in the beautiful coastline, both night and day! Convenient location for me due to the conference, but also convenient for exploring all my favorite spots downtown, all managed w/o a car!

<Content>We booked this holiday for its Bay-side location for a stay over the 4th July weekend and stayed in an executive club family room. From the minute we checked in until the minute we left, we were completely impressed with the facilities on offer from this beautiful, family friendly hotel. We encountered no problems, price wise we paid approx Â£110 per night for the room, that included continental breakfast in the executive lounge (penthouse) and evening snacks and refreshments. We found the rooms to be clean, fresh and very welcoming. a reasonable ammount of room on the balcony with fine views over the marina. The staff were very efficent, friendly and the services was excellent. We dined at the hotel lobby bar and also had room service and found the food qulaity to be very good and reasonably priced. I would have no problems recomending this property to most travelers. An excellent property.

<Title>“You Kidding? Not worth the value AT ALL!!!”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel for one night, and we definitely will not come back again if we are paying for the hotel. My first impression of the hotel was poor service combined with inefficient hotel staff. The receptionist Juan was checking us into the hotel, and he told us our room was "not ready" and all the other "ready" rooms were full. This is totally unacceptable, given the fact that we were checking in 12 midnight, which gives them 12 hours of room cleaning time and the hotel is only 12 floors tall. Afterwards Juan's manager gave us this room on the first floor, which was really the basement because the lobby is on the second floor. Our room had traces of insects, because the first thing i found was a dead bug on my pillow. Although the room looked clean, you never know what is on the carpet. On the next day we took a walk around the marina, and the only good thing about this hotel is the view (which we didn't get, thanks to Juan and his manager) and the presence of a Starbucks next to the lobby. We are truly disappointed with Sheraton with this stay. I thought an elite international hotel chain like Sheraton could have done better with their customers. We paid over $200 for our room and we didn't expect poor service and a basement room with dead insects. I have stayed in other Sheraton hotels and the rooms and service are on a higher level. Stay away from this Sheraton.

<Title>“Amazing Resort hotel, great for business too”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here 7/17/11 for 4 nights. The location is perfect, across the street from airport, but on Harbor Island. It is a beautiful location and great walking along the bay path in front of the hotel. The hotel has a free shuttle to the airport. This is a 4 star very upscale resort on the bay. The lobby is very nice and great for people watching. We are Starwood Gold members and there is a separate check in for SPG members. There are 2 pools, boat rentals out front, ping pong tables, a spa, modern gym, and a cool area called Microsoft link in the lobby. The rooms are very nice. If possible, upgrade to a concierge room and you get a great breakfast and nice light dinner! The front desk staff and managers are awesome, they were very prompt on a few service request items. I love when they answer the phone from the room...hello Mr.... Downsides are parking price (save money on this...hint...check out SAN airport parking off site rates). Internet is NOT wireless in rooms. If you are flexible on your dates, they have great rates many times. Check on Sheraton web site or Kayak. Enjoy your stay. We are returning next month!

<Title>“Best Hospitality and Service I have ever experienced Anywhere! I will never stay anywhere else in San Diego!!”
<Content>I recently stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina for my middle daughter's wedding in San Diego. I stayed with my wife and yo ungest daughter while my oldest daughter and her husband joined two days later. Because this happens to be a very busy time of year for the hotel and it was a very special occasion for me, I wrote an email to the General Manager of the Hotel asking if they could assist me in some special requests. Please bear in mind that I do not hold special status at Sheraton so it wouldn't warrant special service ordinarily. Much to my amazement and pleasure, I receiived an immediate response from Scott Hermes, the General Manager (who was also off that day) and also his Executive Assistant Helga Crum that they would work to try to accommodate my requests. They provided me with significantly more than I could have asked or even expected! A large room with a view together with a location within the complex that I had asked for and to top it off, they sent a note with a gift of wine, cheeses and fruits to welcome me to their hotel! They contacted me virtually every day via phone to see if I had everything I needed and offered even more assistance. This all came from the senior management of the hotel! And, just so you know it wasn't just the management that provides this service, the room service meals and personnel were equally pleasant, the food was great, and the smiles abounded. In addition, the maid service was timely and exceptional. When we needed extra towels and hangers, we received those with the same smile and immediacy of time. The front desk was more than courteous and helpful regardless of which one helped you and the valet parking made an effort to know who I was and which car was mine. Many times they welcomed me back by name. An exceptional hotel with very exceptional personnel. This is obviously a top down personification. If the management is first class, the people will be as well. This made a first class room that much better than any of their competition. As a senior executive, I travel extensively worldwide and have well in excess of 2,000 room nights over the past 10-12 years (yes, you read that correctly) and even with status at other properties, I have NEVER experienced the service, hospitality and genuine customer care that I experienced at this hotel! I can tell you that not only will I ONLY seek out this hotel every visit I have to San Diego, but because of this team, I have become a Sheraton Evangelist all over! I can't thank Helga enough, nor Scott enough! They are by far the best I have ever seen! And because of the service of other members of their team it reflects their value and class of care from the management on down. It may be a four star hotel, but in my book it was at least 5 stars! Thanks again Helga and Scott!!! You're the best!!!!

<Title>“Nice Hotel but what out for hidden fees”
<Content>Our family stayed at the Sheraton for one week. Overall it was a nice hotel. We enjoyed the large pool and great view of the marina. The hotel is a ten minute walk to the airport and about a 50 minute walk to downtown. We did not eat at the hotels restaurant, but did frequent the Starbucks located near the lobby. Another nice feature were the two gas fire pits which are lit nightly and surrounded with rocking chairs. Hammocks were also attached to some palm trees for the guest to use. The hotel will give the occupant a five dollar voucher for use in the hotel if you opt out of daily maid service. We took advantage of this, as they will still bring clean towels and other items on request. We were fist shocked to find out that parking our rental car at the hotel was going to be an additional $22 a day. This ended up costing us an additional $152 which was not disclosed to us when we purchase our package. Additionally, access to the internet from our room would be another $11+ a day. This was also a surprise as most hotels now provide internet access for free. One last thing, the hotel is somewhat isolated from stores, restaurants etc. so be prepared to pay higher than normal prices at the small store located near the lobby. I.e. a ice cream bar was $4.50+.

<Title>“Annual 4th of July Visit was Awesome!”
<Content>My wife and I got married at the Sheraton on 9/19/98 and have been going back ever since. Now we have two beautiful girls and have started a tradition of staying at the Sheraton (4-5 nights) for the 4th of July to enjoy what the property has to offer and the Big Bay Boom fire works show. This trip we had issues with our rooms we had reserved a year in advance with confirmations check-ins 6 months, 3 months and 1 month out the day we did check-in on July 1st. After trying to resolve the issue at the front desk with no resolution, my wife asked to talk to a manager. Daniel Ader was very receptive to our issue with our room. With a busy 3 day holiday weekend Daniel went above and beyond customer service to upgrade us from what we had reserved. By jumping through hoops to help us out we had one of the best times with our family and friends while staying this past 4th of July weekend. We also would like to thank a few others for their customer service, Lea, Jamie from the shoreline (pool bar & grill), Jake from the spa and Francisco our waiter for dinner at the Harborâ€™s Edge. We didnâ€™t get the names of the two employees who manage the kid activities/games but they also did a great job as well. Our girls look forward to the games at the pool and love meeting the other kids that participate as well. We are looking forward to next years visit to the Sheraton.

We had fantastic experiences in the other hotels - the Westin in San Francisco, Carmel Valley Ranch in Carmel and W Hotel in Westwood Village, LA were stand outs for service, hotel locations, facilities and all had their own unique wow factors. The Sheraton Marina had none of the above. We stayed in the second, smaller and definitely second rate Bay Tower. The rooms were fine apart from the noise of the ice machine across the corridor all through the night. It was unclear just how close the airport was from the web site (literally behind the hotel), so noise levels were unexpected. The lobby staff were miserable, we were never greeted with a smile and when I called guest services with a query about coins needed for the laundry, the guy said he didn't know and left it at that! Great training and service (not)! The public areas need serious upgrading and the bar and restaurant area was uninviting and dead most of the time. The pool was appalling - small with a bar area that was closed when we were there and seriously out of date. We felt like poor relations to the guests in the main tower where lobby, bar and pool areas were far superior. Not sure if the staff also felt miserable to be working in the second rate tower, but their indifference to service and general apathy was very disappointing after the high standards we had experienced through the rest of our trip. There were however 2 excellent restaurants a short walk from the hotel with incredible views of the San Diego sky line and marina (particularly at night) which I would highly recommend - The Lighthouse and Island Prime.

<Title>“great wiews of the harbour. we saw the 4th of july fireworks from our balcony”
<Content>older hotel but rooms were clean and had great view. you would get a great view from most rooms unless you were in the bottom floor. we had the harbour view and our teemage children had the marina view. both were good but we preferred the harbour view room. there are 2 separate towers which are 5 min walk apart. we stayed in the smaller tower. the pool and gym is smaller but we could use the one in the other tower if we wanted to. The parking can be a problem so i would go with valet parking if possible. good base to explore sandiego. it is about 10min drive to the gas lamp area/the main tourist strip.

<Title>“Terrible service”
<Content>They completely screwed me over. Overcharged, gave us a cheaper/smaller room than we paid for due to overbooking, parking lot took a half hour to exit from due to broken equipment, they lost our registration info, tried to say we didn't have club access, forgot our free breakfast, tried to charge us $300 for a 28 minute phone call, tried to charge us $160 for minibar use (I didn't touch it)... And had snotty attitude to boot. Just go elsewhere.

<Title>“over priced”
<Content>We stayed at the marina tower for 4 nights.... nice hotel. BUT.... local calls were $2.00 each time. and the sports bar downstairs was way too overpriced. Also, there is really no form of transportation other than taxi and a complimentary shuttle to the airport. So, every time we wanted to go anywhere we would have to add at the very least $30 to our day out just to get to and from anywhere. I would never stay there again. I would chose somewhere closer to downtown or even on Coronado Island... at least you can take a bus or walk to a restaurant. we felt forced to eat at the overpriced restaurant at the hotel because we didn't want to take a cab every time we wanted to eat. Another thing... my husband called front desk to ask where the nearest liquor store was. they told him he'd have to cab it to the nearest one which was 10 minutes away. Well... our last day there we went walking and bought a sandwich at their deli in between the bay tower and the marina tower. (by the way great sandwiches for a great price) turns out, they have wine & beer right in that deli. So FYI for those staying there..... the deli in between hotel was awesome!!!! they also had breakfast there for under $8 per person. Can't believe we found all that out on our last day!!! Hope we have saved a few $$ for all of you who are staying there :)

<Title>“San Diego Sheraton Marina”
<Content>The hotel was nice and clean. During checkin I found out the room had one king bed. I requested a room with 2 separate beds as there were 4 of us (2 adults and 2 kids). They said that is an upgrade and the cost is $20/day extra. They also charged $22/day for parking which I felt was high. During checkout there were several charges amounting to almost $30 which I could not recognize. It turns out that they have sensors on the snack cabinet and by merely opening the cabinet, they charge you even if you did not use any of the snacks. They took out those charges without any fuss.

<Title>“Kudos to Nicolas and Brian”
<Content>I left my Tiffany bracelet and ring in my room recently and did not discover that fact until I was going through security at the airport. I have not had good luck in the past with lost jewelry from a different chain of hotels (B.W.), so my first thoughts were that I would never see my jewelry again. Once through securtiy I called the Sheraton, still not thinking I would ever see my jewelry again. What a pleasant surprise to learn from Nicolas (Lost and Found) that Brian (Security) retrieved my jewelry! Nicolas was very helpful in making arrangements to have my jewelry sent to me. I am so thankful to Brian and Nicolas for their honesty and professionalism in returning my jewelry to me.

<Title>“Excellent hotel, great location”
<Content>Can't say enough good thngs about the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. I stayed with my husband and 2 year old son in the Bay Tower for 4 night July 6-10. Had a wonderful room facing the harbour. We loved being able to watch all the boats move about the harbour and had a great view of the Carl Vinson and Midway aircraft carriers. Rooms where spacious for a hotel room and had plenty of room for a crib. Also, absolutely no airport noise during the overnight hours. The grounds and buildings are clean and well kept. Everything, in my opinion appeared to be fairly modern and up to date. The pool at the Marina Tower are amazing and loved the poolside service. Being from Chicago the rate for valet ($28 a day) seemed more than reasonable and the valet staff was quick, friendly and eager to help or offer directions or recommendations. If and when we return to San Diego we'd definately stay here again. Thank you Sheraton for a great experience during our short California vacation.

<Content>Very ambivalent about this property - not nearly good enough to earn serious accolades, but not bad enough to be trashed. Go there, expect not much and you won't be disappointed. Proximity to airport is an asset; the view from rooms higher up is very pleasing in pretty much any direction. I would probably stay there again if the price was aggressive.

<Title>“Meh!”
<Content>Just a typical hotel. Tons of weddings going on so lots of drunk people stumbling around the lobby. Also, we stayed in the Bay Tower facing the airport...bad idea. Planes start taking off at 6am so if you like to sleep in I suggest staying on the other side of the the Tower. Also, the breakfast buffet at a Holiday Inn Express was better than this one. And for $19 per person I expected alittle more. My husband asked if they had any everything bagels. The hostess said "No we don't but everybody asks for them" WOW...just wow. It's very clean and very average. I guess it's good for families and weddings. Also $28 for overnight valet parking ($22 for self park) and $18.95 for one day of internet access. Just crazy!

<Title>“Outstanding service, our whole famly will be back next year!”
<Content>My girlfriend and I got the room as a gift from my Aunt and Uncle for the 4th of July weekend. We had no problems checking in, it was quick, easy and the lady who checked us in was very nice!. We absolutely loved the nautical style of decor considering we both work at a yacht club. That might have been the best that we've ever slept, the beds and pillows are out of this world comfortable. Rooms were clean, new furniture and a nice flat screen TV. We are so incredibly pleased with the fact that the WHOLE entire hotel is pet friendly, which we have a 5 month old puppy who loved the stay as much as we did! We had only a couple issues that were resolved very professionally. Parking is $22 a day which we didn't realize until we pulled our car in a parked, the hotel paid for our first night as a courtesy. We also had a small dining issue and the F&B manager Ronnie Hauptmann completely took care of us and went above and beyond to make sure our experience was amazing. The stay wouldn't have been as enjoyable without the care that he gave us! Very professional, courteous and hospitable. The front desk employee named Pedro gave us complimentary breakfast after we had a bad experience with the hot tub, again went above and beyond to make our romantic stay pleasurable. I spread the good word to our family who will all be staying there again next year! Again thanks to F & B manager Ronnie Hauptmann and guest service employee Pedro for taking the extra step to make our stay exceptional.

<Title>“WARNING - OVERCHARGED”
<Content>The hotel itself is OK, particularly if you are in the main tower, but management and staff are untrained or liars. Upon checking in I asked if there were any view rooms in the main tower or suites available (as a Platium guest I get a free upgrade). I was told that only rooms in the other tower were available. So off to the car and the other tower where we went to a room with virtually no view and strong cigarette smell. I made a quick call to a manager and was told there were view rooms in the main tower or I could choose a suite for my free upgrade? Back to the car and the main tower...getting exhausted now. Finally they overcharged me $184 versus my confirmed rate of $109??? Worst of all was the treatment I recieved from the Manager (Dena) when I called to get this corrected. First she treated me like I was lying (forward me your confirmation!), then she tried to explain that it was just the taxes etc... When I interupted her to explain it was not the taxes she became enraged that I called her lady and not by her name, sorry I forgot. There was a huge toyota meeting and they were treating those people like royalty and everyone else seemed to get second rate treatment, I heard that from other guests as well at the bar, not professional (I believe that is why they were holding extra rooms in the main tower?).

<Title>“Ideal hotel for super early flight departure”
<Content>Seeking a hotel in close proximity to the airport with reliable shuttle service, we chose the Sheraton across from the airport on Harbor Island. Unreliable taxi service from hotels further afar in the past made this hotel an easy choice, its shuttle begins operating at 4:45a.m. We booked a standard room in the Harbor tower and were in no time checked in by friendly staff, upgraded to a 10th floor room with balcony and a beautiful view of the comings and goings in San Diego Harbor. The room was very large, well appointed, brightly lit, spotless, including the carpet which appeared new. A super large king bed with soft sheets and good pillows made for a good night of sleep. Airport noise was not audible at all, but walls do not completely muffle very noisy Vacu-flush toilets in adjacent rooms. A 48" flat screen TV, safe, stocked mini-bar, and a coffee maker with Starbucks coffee packets, desk and a comfortable seating group rounded out the amenities. Not quite up to par was the on-site restaurant which is really a dimly lit bar with tiny round tables, more suited to have a drink than to have dinner (the actual restaurant area is roped off and set aside for breakfast use only). Wanting to have dinner we chose from the limited menu a light meal which was tasty and met our needs. Danny who wears the hats of bartender, waiter, busboy and does everything but prepare the food he serves with a smile as well. Only one other person ate in the restaurant, which may be an indication that other nearby establishments on Harbor Island are a better dining choice. Nevertheless, the hotel perfectly matched our needs, and should we have another flight at an ungodly early hour, we will stay there again.

<Title>“Nice Hotel”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego for a long weekend back in May. The hotelitself is nice, I think it just went through a renovation. We stayed in the Marina Tower and had a great view of the pool and the marina. The room was spacious and clean. The grounds were nice and the area surrounding the hotel was also nice, with a great view of downtown San Diego. The hotel is very close to the airport(virtually across the street), but hearing the airport noise in our room was not an issue and both my fiance and I are light sleepers.The parking situation was the only thing we were unhappy with. First off, the daily parking fee is astronomical. Second the parking lot itself is very difficult to navigate because a portion of it is blocked off so if you go down a row and cant find a spot, you have to reverse to get out of that row. Third, we kept having trouble with the key reader and had to make several attempts each time we exited the parking lot to get the gate to open so we could leave, which was extremely frustrating. Overall this is an average hotel, not high end or filled with luxury, but clean and in a good location!

<Content>Great hotel. Stayed there before. Fairly excellent location. $10-$12 cab ride to most everywhere one wants to go--Old Town, Sea World, Downtown. Right on the water at the marina with a nice pool and outside setup. $22 a day for parking is a bit stiff if you have a car, but it is understandable being so close to the airport (they don't want airport parkers). Starbuck's on site makes coffee choices numerous and easy. One restaurant is on the spendy side, the other is a bar scenario and a welcome respite at the end of the day. Free wireless in the lobby and a big bank of computers for free use just beyond the lobby.

<Title>“Nice view of downtown skylight”
<Content>Use price line bidding and got this hotel. Not much of a saving using price line. There are two towers for this hotel, one is the Marina Tower which is across from the airport. This is the main tower with all the amenities, large reception area, free computers, larger pool, spa, etc. We pulled to the front of the Marina Tower and the bellman checked the guest list and told us we were at the other tower, the Bay Tower. It was efficient and we didnâ€™t have to get out of the car. The Bay Tower is Â¼ mile around the corner from the Marina Tower. Itâ€™s doesnâ€™t have the glamour lobby. There was only one computer in the lobby. It has a small outdoor pool next to the parking lot. It feels like lower class in the Bay Tower. Parking was $22/day. The room key card worked fine for the parking access. The front desk staffs at the Bay Tower are efficient, but indifferent. Theyâ€™re not rude but not friendly either. Theyâ€™re just doing their job to check you in, check you out and answer your questions. The hallway was dim, not brightly lit. The room is renovated and spacious. Each room has a wall to wall balcony, great view of either the harbor/downtown or the marina with boats. We did hear the airplane noise and it woke us up early in the morning. No need for wake-up call. Firm bed and king size pillows for king size bed. Sheets are winkle free. There is mini bar and youâ€™ll get charged if you removed an item, even if you replace it. There is no fridge in the room. The bathroom was small but it has everything we need. The hotel is in Harbor Island, away from the busy downtown, yet itâ€™s very close to it. It has a great view of downtown skylight at night. . Itâ€™s also next to the airport so we can hear the airplane noise from our room. Itâ€™s also close to Balboa Park, the Zoo, Sea World and other attractions. There is only one restaurant near the hotel. There are no other restaurants and stores near the hotel. Itâ€™s kind of isolated. This is a great alternative to staying at downtown or hotel circle or mission bay. Short drive to attractions on local road, no need to use the freeway and stuck in traffic.

<Title>“VIP Treatment - what a hotel stay should be”
<Content>I try to get out on occasion and "visit" San Diego so I don't forget to enjoy the beauty of my city. I had a Staycation at this hotel over the Memorial Day weekend. There are so many great hotels in San Diego and I've had some great stays in other cities as well. I travel a few times each year for business and pleasure - and I can honestly say that this was the best overall experience that I've had. The staff was wonderful. My great experience started at check-in and didn't stop until check-out. The room was quiet, comfortable, and the modern design was so beautiful. The view of the marina was breathtaking and got better with the sunset. I enjoyed lounging by the pool and taking a stroll on the grounds. The dinner from Harbor's Edge was so good and the view of the fireworks at Seaworld after dinner from my balcony as fun. The next morning I capped off my stay with a breakfast (outstanding) and a few spa treatments. Every person that I came in contact with responded as though I was the most important person in the hotel I have plans to return for a personal stay, as well as to bring an event there so everyone can share the experience.

The staff was extremely helpful. I requested a roll away for one night and it came within a few minutes...I was amazed at the quick response. The exercise facility is state of the art!...not your usual cramped little hotel room converted into an exercise room. I left something in the room when I departed.

<Title>“Very enjoyable stay”
<Content>Our airline's flight and hotel package offered several hotel choices. We liked the look of the Sheraton and marina, but were aware that it was some distance from the downtown area, so we had to factor in extra cost for cabs and plan our days' events. The hotel is basically across from the airport. We heard planes now and then, but it was not disruptive at all. Check-in was very efficient, and extremely friendly (thank-you Dinah!). Arriving in the morning, we expected to check our bags, and get our room later in the day, but we got our room right away. We were offered our choice of the two buildings, and picked the main one, knowing the rooms were smaller but it had more restaurants etc. We were asked for our view preference, and chose the marina view (gorgeous). The room was a decent size, very nicely furnished and clean. The beds were extremely comfortable, and had beautiful linens. We opted for the 'green' choice and didn't have daily housekeeping but towels were replaced upon request. This gave us a daily $5 voucher towards food/beverages, which we used for our morning coffee at Starbucks (located in the lobby). Our package also included breakfast, which is pricey in my opinion. If we had paid off the menu for our breakfast, including a fruit bowl (delicious), juice, coffee and main item, the price per person would have been at least $30. Without having a car, we had breakfast every day at the hotel (food and service were both excellent). Be prepared to drive or take cabs to get around, as there is very little in the immediate area within walking distance. We weighed the option of renting a car vs paying cab fare to get around. Daily parking at the hotel is $22. Added to the cost of car rental, and not being familiar with the area, we decided to travel by cab. Allow (pre-tip, round trip) approx. $30 to/from Old Town, $56 to/from Coronado (hotel Del Coronado), $25 to/from downtown/Gaslamp Quarter. With only 4 days, and much on our agenda, we didn't have a chance to spend time at the pool or use any of the other amenities. Quinn's sports bar was a nice place to end our day (kids are allowed, even though it's called a bar). There is a free computer area for web-surfing, email etc., and for printing boarding passes (note - in-room internet is $11.95/day). Since our room was included with our airline package, it's difficult to rank the value, but while we were there, the 'walk-in' rate was $199/night. We did not use the mini-bar or room service. All of the staff that we met - front desk, concierge, restaurant, bar, valets, cleaning - were extremely friendly and helpful. All in all, we were very pleased with this hotel and I would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Checked into a corner bay view in Bay Tower. Room was decor is nice and view is great. However AC can't cool room below 70 ( it's 65 outside), cable TV has no channels. The hotels response was were redoing the cables in the building. Really? No wireless internet and the wired internet ( even with the "premium" upgrade is slow) and if your not a platinum member it cost $18.95 a day. If your looking for somewhere close to the airport to spend a night it's ok assuming they get the TV issue fixed, maybe 1 channel that works. Otherwise you should stay in town, at $28 to park you could stay downtown and be where the action is.

<Title>“Excellent service in every area.”
<Content>The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful to our questions. We stayed at the Sheraton Marina which had a variety of restaurants with great staffs, as well. The Marina was very cleanly and comfortable with a wonderful lobby with computers and couches for guests. Although the rooms are just basic, they are cute. The lost and found desk is also very helpful and efficient. They are quick to respond to inquiries and assist you.

<Title>“Good Base of Operations for SD”
<Content>Had no idea that this was an "airport" hotel until we arrived. Right across the street from Lindbergh Field. That was fine though as the hotel had a nice resort feel to it. Self Park was 22.00 and valet 28.00 or so. Couldnt find a spot so we went with Valet. Service was prompt when we called for our car. We were assigned on the 11th floor of the Marina tower which is the main building with the lobby and restaurants. The floor said Starwood Preferred Guests floor. Thought that was odd, but as an SPG member it was nice to have a high floor. There are 3 separate towers and are actually spread out along the marina. the view of the SD skyline was great as well as the runway at the airport. Im a fan of the romance of planes coming and going so it wasnt too bad. The sound proofing was good as we didnt here to much from the airport. Room is standard size and we had a double. Bathroom was really small with combo shower/bath. TV was also on the smaller side of 32 inches. Room service was available 24 hours and a late night burger after a wedding hit the spot. Hotel caters to the convention/conference crowd. Still felt very welcomed by the staff upon arrival. Access to Downtown/Gaslamp was about 10 minutes and the beaches are another 15 minutes or so. Would rather stay in Gaslamp area next time we are in town. Not a bad choice though if you need to be near the airport and close to attractions.

<Title>“Wow!”
<Content>This property is very good. We enjoyed two nights in a double room in the Marina Tower, overlooking the pool and the marina. There is an in-house Starbucks (I'm an addict-so this was quite convenient) We enjoyed the food and drinks from the sports bar, the outdoor firepits, the walks along the harbor, and the peace and quiet. Even though it's right across from the airport, the plane noise was negligible. We were able to purchase tickets for the Old Town Trolley tour, picked up right at the hotel (at a decent hour, I must add). Truly recommend the experience this hotel offers.

<Title>“Fantasatic "airport" hotel with great views of the marina and a good pool”
<Content>Great ambiance and views for an "Airport hotel". Only 2 min away from the airport but feels like its own world. Not the best location for getting to the beaches ($25 cab to mission beach) or downtown ($10-$15 cab), but still one of the nicer airport area hotels i've ever stayed in.

<Title>“Wonderful View, great location”
<Content>This hotel is right on the harbor and the view is great. We walked along the water and looked at all the boats/yachts. We were there for 5 days. The restaurant is great, food is good, service was good. The ice cream store became a daily stop for us; also ordered a picnic lunch for one day which was great. The only downside was that we agreed to go green when we checked in which we understood to mean that sheets would not be changed every day. That was fine - we don't change them at home every day. But as it turned out, they didn't do any housekeeping at all. We had to call everyday to have them pick up garbage and bring clean towels. You would think they would vacuum, dust, clean the bathroom, change the towels, empty the wastebaskets. So if you don't care about any of that then go green - we won't do it again! Other than that, it's a really nice place to stay. So because of that, I gave them a poor grade on cleanliness - it was very clean when we checked in, though.

<Title>“Never go back”
<Content>I am a Starwood Gold Member and I was extremely disappointed by our stay over Memorial Day. When we got to the hotel we were directed to the Bay Tower which I later found out was a Raddison just recently purchased by Sheraton. While the rooms were big with great views the noise level at this hotel was terrible. We virtually got no sleep while we were there. In addition I did not find the staff there were very accomdating or friendly. Would stay at the Westin gaslamp in the future or elsewhere.

<Title>“less than stellar experience this time around”
<Content>The hotel itself has really cool nautical decorations and I love the fish tank in the lobby. Our room was located right over the pool and it was really really loud due to some music that was being played at a high volume the whole weekend. We asked to be moved to another room, but they wouldn't move us, even after repeated requests. The food in the hotel restaurants was quite expensive, which we expected, but the quality did not match the price. It was greasy and made us feel kind of ill. The best part of the whole experience was when we rented bicycles and rode around San Diego. There is a deli the concierge recommended that was in walking distance...DO NOT GO THERE...rude staff and disgusting food!

<Content>My wife and I stayed two nights in this beautiful hotel which is wonderfully located at the San Diego Marina. If you have the chance try to get one of the upper floors. The southerly view over the Marina is just stunning. The rooms' interiors are modern and it is very clean including the beautiful bathroom. Even we booked on very short notice the rates for the room was very reasonable and the service was just great. Don't forget to try the mind-blowing pancakes they offer downstairs... they're the best I ever had!!! Enjoy!

<Title>“San Diego... a hotel experience not to be missed.”
<Content>This hotel is great for business and individual travelers. It is close to the airport but you do not have the noise of the planes and it offers many amenities for all to enjoy., The staff and service in all departments is wonderful...Most of the employees have been at the property for many years and it has a family feel to all that they do. The food is excellent and a good value for what you receive. All the rooms have a water view..but of course the higher the floor the better. The property is close to downtown and a cab ride away from many activities other restaurants or shopping areas. The meeting space works well for business but it is on the far side and does not bother any of the individual travelers. I would recommend this property to anyone looking for a all around good experience while visting and staying in San Diego .

<Title>“Sue offered her personal items to make up my mistake, BIG thanks!”
<Content>I am so impressed that "Sue from Chicago" was my angel for offering help last weekend, San Diego Rock and Roll Marathon event. I was unpacking my gear and realized I had two left shoes. Not what I want to realize at 5pm the day before the marathon. I called the hotel line and got "Sue from Chicago" to ask about internet connections so I could locate a Target or something. Sue asked my shoe size and offered her shoes if they were in her car, and could I wait 10 minutes for her break. She met me in the lobby and had actually taken them out of her car. I was so impressed that an employee would offer something of thiers for my event. I want to give a shout out to Sue, and I LOVED the bedding. Two down pillows and two something else pillows. I love down. San Diego. Late check out request. So, this was a great experience for me with the customer service. A bed is a bed, but Sue, you made my evening with your offer and follow up. And the hotel was great.

<Title>“Away from the city and happy to be!”
<Content>Stayed at the Sheraton from June 4-6 via Hotwire, and it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. We used the self park and checked in at the hotel, but learned out room was further down the road in the 2nd (older/original) hotel called the Bay Tower. I'm glad it was. No room has a bad view unless you're on the ground floor. One side of the hotel looks out over the marina, the other side looks out over the bay and Coronado Island. The amenities are few, as I think the pool was on the roof (never saw signage though), not sure if it had a gym, but the balcony with table and chairs made up for everything. The hotel is ways from Downtown, about 3..5 miles, but very close to the airport terminals. We were in town for the Marathon and resorted to taxis to get around easily. They were even able to take my wife to Sea World (about 5.5 miles away) to meet me at the Finish line. The Valet service was exceptional in helping us (and saving my wife from a VERY DISGRUNTLED taxi driver), so much thanks to them! We loved that this hotel was quiet, away from the Downtown madness was nice, and the rooms were spacious, clean, amazing view, and great for a weekend trip

<Title>“All the extras really add up”
<Content>Although the hotel was nice and clean and comfortable, they really nickel and dime you for everything, so I would not recommend staying here. You have to pay a ridiculous nightly rate for parking ($22 to $28 per night), you have to pay for internet access and the food in the restaurant is exorbitantly priced and not any better than any other restaurant. They also had the nerve to tell me that I could not feed my baby her baby food at breakfast because it was "outside food." Really? Were they going to go in the back an puree organic sweet potatoes for her to eat? Probably not.

<Content>Was looking for somewhere to sleep near the airport and booked into this hotel at the last minute. I was extremely impressed with the property and staff. Check-in took less than 3 minutes for my 2 rooms - I've never run into front desk staff so efficient (but still friendly). The hotel is clean and well taken care of. Rooms are reasonable size, beds comfortable. Soundproofing must be extensive, as planes flying directly overhead were almost completely unnoticeable. Great views from the balcony as well. Excellent shower - the best I had on the trip! No problems with this hotel and I would not hesitate to recommend it to others.

This allowed us to be away for a night to enjoy each others company and remind ourselves why we are together and how much we love each other. Our son Erik was born almost eleven years ago he has a diagnosis of Tetrasomy 18p, this entails an array of disorders. He has overcome many challenges that most cannot imagine, we have become quite familiar with many specialist, Doctors offices, Emergency rooms, special programs, school meetings to help Erik become as independent as possible. He has been our number one priority and has never been without us at any time over the past eleven years. It was the first time we have spent one entire day alone with no children during that time. We cannot describe how wonderful a day we had we would like to thank UCP and the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina from the bottom of our hearts and may you recieve many blessings.

<Title>“Booked on Priceline - Excellent Value”
<Content>We decided to take a long weekend trip to San Diego to visit some friends that live in the area, and booked this hotel by selecting a 4-star "name your own price" deal on Priceline. I believe we only paid $95 per night. Overall, for $95 a night, this hotel was excellent value. We had a nice large room, with a balcony overlooking the marina. The room was spacious, clean and had been renovated, although the hotel itself is quite old. We ate the breakfast buffet which was also good. PROS: - Excellent value @ $95 per night when booking on priceline. - Good breakfast buffet - Great location (close to Downtown and the Airport) - Nice, clean, spacious rooms CONS: - Older Hotel - Rates may by higher when not booking through priceline

<Title>“Definitely 4 star”
<Content>I stayed here one night on a business trip. Got a great rate compared to the downtown hotels. This is the only hotel that is at the entrance to the airport, so if you want an airport hotel, this is it. It is also right in the middle of the marina with boats and beautiful views in every direction. Check in was quick because it was late night. Got upgraded as a SPG member even though I was paying a very low rate. The room was bigger than average because of the curvature of the room. Exceptionally clean with 42" flat tv and nicely decorated. King bed was big and comfortable. I only heard one plane before I dozed off, but the room is sound proofed well. The lobby is bigger then most hotels downtown. It has a great social/computer center with free Internet and computer use. There are two restaurants and two different bars, and a full service Starbucks. Although the prices for food in the bar were high, I think they are on par with most 4 star hotels. While the menu had some high priced items, there were many items in the $12-16 range. Although parking is $22, this is the same if not less than what many 3 star hotels charge downtown. I have paid as much as $36. Since there are dozens of hotel choices in the downtown area, this hotel only makes sense for me if I don't need to get around the city. Although only 2 miles from the heart of downtown, it is on a peninsula and a little detached from anything other than the marina and airport. On the other hand, it's location provides great views, particularly at sunrise and sunset while viewing the big city in the background.

<Content>This was our third stay at this great hotel and the service was even better than ever. The location is perfect for us, within a few minutes of all the great San Diego beaches and parks. From arrival to check out the staff could not have been nicer, they were very warm, genuine and welcoming. Especially Chris at the front desk and the servers in the club lounge and the harbors edge restaurant. We enjoyed great food and a lovely comfortable room with gorgeous views overlooking the Marina. Our toddler was mesmerized by the amazing yachts in the marina and the beautiful aquarium in the lobby and our tweener loved the 'link' in the lobby. Our favorite spot was the firepit by the marina, the perfect place for sunset.

<Title>“Nice hotel, a couple of problems”
<Content>Overall this hotel and experience was nice. We did run into a couple of problems that will have me looking elsewhere to stay next time even though we are SPG members and try to stay at Starwood properties when we can. The first is the pricing in the restaurants. Obviously all hotels charge a premium but charging $8 for a kids meal which consists of a stale Smuckers Crustable? Second is the parking situation. At $22 a day, which again we realize parking is always going to be high and we spent $22 at the next hotel we stayed at on this vacation, although that was for valet parking. The lot that you park in is a dirt lot that is easily 1/2 mile from your room while they are allowing non-guests to also park in the lot for a fee which makes it even more difficult to find a spot. On check out when we mentioned the parking lot issue the SPG desk clerk acted as though she had no idea what we were referring to and really didn't care. If your room is near the pool be aware that it is very loud. We had to finally call at 11:30 to ask them to turn down the music which they did but it was amazing that they let it go that long.

<Content>We love staying in Mission Bay when we come to San Diego but wanted something different. I got a good deal on hotwire. Location was nice. Next to the airport but the sounds weren't too bad like other peoples comments. (and I'm a light sleeper) We stayed in the lanai section and loved it. It was a 3 story building next to the main hotel. Loved the 2 pools and view from our room. We had a view of a pool and marina. It was also close to the parking lot and didn't have to deal with the lobby area. We even watched the fireworks from Seaworld from our hotel. Parking is alot but you pay that at most 4 star hotels. The only complaint I had was the bathroom was very small. The door would hit you when you were sitting on the toilet. When you have small kids, that's not fun! Was also hard getting into the shower/bath if the door was open. Loved the starbucks and computer lounge area in the lobby.

<Title>“Nice hotel, Beautiful view.”
<Content>After reading some of the reviews on here, I was pleasently suprised with this hotel! We stayed in a room on the 11th floor of the Marina Tower, where we had special access to the Club Lounge. We got a good deal on the internet on this room with special access to the Club Lounge for a free continental breakfast every morning. Our room was nice - we had a view of the water (the Marina and the pool). The only thing I didn't like was the pillows were not very good, also they did not have a single towel rack in the bathroom!!! That was quite a pain, especially with 3 of us in a room using towels. The restaurant's in the hotel were O.K. They were quite expensive. A drink at Quinn's was $12, and pasta with chicken was $21. They also let you take drinks down to the pool, which was nice. In the evenings, Quinn's and Tapatini were quite popular places to be. I really liked the atmosphere. It was a great way to relax and meet new people! The area around the hotel does not have much. There are 2 other restaurants that are able half a mile, and a mile away from the hotel. Island Prime and Tom Ham's Lighthouse were both worth walking to. We ended up taking a taxi home because we were too full to walk. We used taxi's to get everywhere because we did not want to worry about trying to use the buses. Taxi's are a bit more expensive than the buses and trolleys, but it saves you tons of time and hassle! The free shuttle to and from the airport was very nice. I loved the view from the hotel. Being right on the ocean and in the marina was beautiful. The paths to walk along the ocean were very nice. I would suggest requesting the Marina Tower, as it is the part that has all of the amentities. The Bay Tower is a little ways away from the main tower and does not have any amentities. The service we received at this hotel was great. Check in was quick. Room service was quick. The concierge was AWESOME! and the bell boy's outside to help us in and out of the taxi's was great!

<Title>“Very Clean. Not a 4 star.”
<Content>Stayed with my family over an early Spring Break in April. This is not a true 4 star. It felt like a 3 star. Not plush in any way. Very basic. Plastic cups in the bathroom. Nothing special. Though the hotel is nice and clean. It is an uneventful place to stay. It is walking distance to some good restaurants. But you have to get in your car to go to any other fun places in the city. Parking is $24! My 7 and 5 year olds enjoyed having the marina to look out to every morning. Other than that, there was nothing for them to do in the hotel. As the weather was drab. We stayed in the new building. I was told the older building had more to it. Starbucks and such.

A trolley shuttle runs in the morning and a free airport shuttle is available too! Free internet in the lobby means keeping in touch and you can look up things to do. The pool area was beautiful. The only issues were an ill informed concierge, and they did not restock the minibar. The restaurants in the hotel were very good, and I especially enjoyed the Tapa/Martini bar - ask for Scott! ;)

The rooms were natical themed and very comfortable. Went with friends and they came to our room that night and we played cards and had a bottle of wine and cheese my daughter had sent me for mothers day thru room service. It was fantastic. Then when it was time to hit the sheets I was double impressed. The sheets were so nice and new. They were like sleeping in brand new sheets for the first time. I was overly impressed with the Sheraton. Definately would re-visit. Debbie Schlotbom

Check in really quick and the front desk was very courteous. Room was very clean and the view was good. Some airport/airplane noise. They could use better quality of toiletry. Bed was fantastic!!!! Somewhat of limited parking...parked in the dirt parking 3 out of 4 days but it was only 20 yards of extra walking. Ate at Quinn's...good service and decent food. Went to Starbucks for 2 breakfast/coffee....employees need to stop yawning when working the cash register (both days). Otherwise, good hotel and good employees!

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>The hotel is clean, up to date and very close to the airport (but not in the flight path so not too much noise). The price seemed high, but then again everything is outragous in CA. We were at a conference and the hotel did a good job putting it on. Had one lunch in the bar and it was tasty. It is fairly close to downtown (about a $15 cab ride to Petco Park). The exercise room was as good as gym.

<Title>“Love, Love, Loved It!!!!!”
<Content>If I had any negatives to say it would be that the mattress was really firm. Personally I do not like a firm mattress, thus, my back was bothering me. The hotel was very clean and the staff was very helpful. The bayside view was wonderful. The location is great and getting to the main attractions is easy. I would strongly recommend this hotel to others and definitely plan on going back. I am VERY critical when it comes to hotels so trust me when I say this is well worth the money.

<Title>“Great hotel, but secluded with $22 parking!”
<Content>I stayed here with my sister as we were planning her destination wedding. We got a great rate on hotels.ca, however, when you factor in the $22 parking, it doesn't seem to be as great of a bargain. There is absolutely no street-side parking, and a car is mandatory given that this hotel is located close to the airport and basically far away from amenities and tourist attractions (Coronado, Balboa Park, Mission Beach, Fashion Valley etc...). The rooms were fantastic. It was very clean, and spacious, and the gym is fantastic. There are many cardio machines, however, the free weights are geared more towards men than women. There is an excellent running route along the bay, which I enjoyed immensely. There are free computers with wireless in the lobby, or you can use your own laptop. Unfortunately, the wireless did not reach our room. It may be a good idea to ask for a room close to the lobby so you can use a smartphone in your room. In sum, the rooms were great, however, it was a bit far away from the sights. I would recommend this as a transit hotel as there is a free airport shuttle a couple times an hour.

<Title>“Great Service!”
<Content>Awesome staff. Great location! We stayed in the main building and it was beautiful. The rooms were clean and very tastefully decorated. It's next to the hotel, but we never once heard the planes. My only gripe is the parking fees. $22 a day for self-parking and $28 for valet. We decided to valet since there was an event going on when we arrived and self-parking was pretty full. The valet service was awesome. We would call down before leaving the room and our car would be waiting for us when we got to the front door. Just wish they could give hotel guests a break on the parking fees.

<Title>“Pure Bliss”
<Content>I recently took a day trip with friends and we stopped into the spa at the Sheraton for massages and some relaxation, and it was amazing! The staff was extremely helpful, the spa director personally came out to greet us and ensured we had any and everything we needed through the afternoon, the front desk attendant was extremely pleasant and helpful and the masseuse (I had Gary, highly recommend!) was spectacular. After my hour massage, I was so relaxed I didn't want to get up! Afterward my friends and I hung out by the hot tub and pool for the remainder of the afternoon which was great to continue our day of relaxation. The hot tub was spacious and the pool temperature was just right, plus, not too mention the great view of marina...it doesn't get much better than that! All in all it was probably one of the most relaxing days I have ever had and I can't wait to plan the next visit.

<Title>“Nice view, but remote”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton with my wife and two daughters (ages 6 and 3). From reading other entries, I realized that I should request the Bay Tower, which I understand the rooms are a little older (although recently renovated) and a little bigger. We stayed on the eight floor, which had a great view of San Diego Bay. Our stay included the weekend, so we had a great view of the boats traversing by. One factor to consider is that the Bay Tower is approximately a quarter mile from the main facility at the Marina Tower and Lanai areas. I didn't really spend time at the other areas, but I heard that the amenities (business area, resturant and pool) may be a little nicer there. We wanted the bigger room and the view. We did have breakfast at the restaurant at the Bay Tower. It is buffet-style with the basic bacon/sausage, eggs/omlette, potatoes. There are also breakfast pastries, oatmeal, cold cereal and fruit. It is nice, The cost is what you would expect from a place higher-end hotel like the Sheraton. The pool area at the Bay Tower is a little small. There is also a hot tub. If the pool area is of particular interest for your family, I'd suggest staying at the Marina Tower and/or Lanai. Because of the weather, we didn't use the pool. Location is a bit remote. Hotel is right across the entrance to San Diego Airport. I could see how it would be convenient for a business meeting with people flying in from across the country. However, it is 10-15 minutes away from Horton Plaza/Downtown/Gaslamp District. It is about the same distance to Balboa Park and and the San Diego Zoo. As such, you will need vehicle transportation to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city (and pay for parking at most places along the way). Self-parking was $22/night. You use your room key to get in and out (so make sure you have it). It is commeasurate with the downtown hotels. I'm note sure why it is so expensive, but make sure that you factor that into your plans. The Wall Street Journal and USA Today were available in the lobby. In all, we had a good stay at the Sheraton. We really enjoyed the view from our room. However, the location is a bit farther away if you were expecting to be in the heart of the action in San Diego.

<Title>“Good choice for short stay”
<Content>Good sized room with nautical theme, balcony with nice bay view even on "garden view" price. Comfy bed. Chose the $5 food voucher over room cleaning, but just a warning that means no housekeeping visit at all-- beds left unmade. Took free shuttle to airport to catch city bus into town and avoided high overnight parking fee. Pros: nice rooms with view of bay or marina, comfy bed, close to airport, has pool/spa and restaurants, free shuttle to and from airport, free internet for 1 hr/day in business center. Cons: high priced parking if you have a car, weird not to get ANY housekeeping, have to take bus to attractions in town.

<Title>“No longer barefoot”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton on a business trip (although i did have a couple days to play). This was my first visit to San Diego and your Hotel made my stay all the more fabulous. The room was kept clean throughout my stay and all of the staff were helpful and pleasant. I flew back to Sacramento and realized i left a rather expensive pair of shoes in the room. I called and left a message for "Lost and Found" and withing a few hours Nicholas had returned my call and got the ball rolling to get my shoes back to me. Within 3 days i had them back. It was just one more wonderful experience that your hotel provide me with. Thank you Nicholas.... Thank You Sheraton. Ayren

<Title>“Great View - Far Away”
<Content>I've stayed at this hotel more than a few times, using Priceline of course. Even though it seems its close to downtown, it really isn't. It is however across the street from the airport, so it would be very convenient for someone just flying into the city for the first time. The hotel is clean, has a beautiful view of the San Diego bay, and the staff is pretty nice, but at times non existent. The rooms are pretty nice, and they make you feel like you are staying on a boat (very nautical). The only issues with the hotel is that the parking is fairly expensive ($25 a night), even though its nowhere near downtown, so why charge downtown prices?! I would still stay there again, and that's because of the value your getting compared to the costs that you pay compared to hotels downtown, but then again you have to take a little value away for location.

<Title>“Does Not Cater for Children”
<Content>Quite a nice Hotel in a location that is betwixt and between. Not really within walking distance of any facilities (cafes, shops etc) but has a beautiful outlook over the Marina. Very handy to the airport though, if you are flying in. Our room faced the Marina so aircraft noise was not a problem. May be different on airport side. The TV selection is skewed towards business with very few Childrens channels. Glad we had a room at the main building as the other section was quite a distance. Must mention Rocio as she was a standout server.

<Title>“Perfect staycation!!!”
<Content>It was my birthday weekend, we lucked out with priceline. This hotel has been in SD for a while and we were a little apprehensive. We heard about the renovation and it was fantastic!!! First and foremost - the option to decline housekeeping for a $5.00 voucher that can be used at the hotel (yes, Starbucks too) is BRILLIANT! Why can't every hotel do this!!! We always decline housekeeping and tidy our own room, hang towels for reuse, make our own bed, which saves the hotel $$$$ with no incentive, this place gets it! They will give you clean towels by the way, and you still get the $ 5.00 voucher! Another thing, the elevators are ample, large and fast, the elevator lobby on each floor is huge, bright, scenic and impressive, again as compared to gaslamp hotels, which seem to skimp on elevators if you ask me. The only drawback is distance from gaslamp, but this hotel made up for it. When we checked in the kind clerk said we had an economy room booked, but she promptly said she'd put us in a better room on the 6th floor, and we got a king as we had hoped for. The room is very spacious, with a downtown view, balcony, great bed and linens. Small bathroom, but well done - subway tile in shower, tub, lots of spots to hold soap, shampoo, etc., rain shower head, marble vanity with very nice lighting. Flat screen TV, high ceilings, very nice. Super, super quiet, even with airport across the street! The pool set it apart from other gaslamp hotels. It was really awesome. Overlooking the marina, tons of space, lots of lounge chairs, big pool, sunny, cabana bar, really great for downtown SD. The hotel lobby is great, computer kiosks with internet, cozy, modern. Starbucks in lobby is great. Parking at $ 22.00 for self park in lot that is part dirt is ridiculous. If you self park, be sure to bring room key to let yourself out of unattended parking lot! We had to re-park, go to lobby, get another key, just to exit the parking lot! A drag. We loved this hotel. The spacious grounds, spacious rooms, pool, we hope to stay again!!!!!

<Title>“Sacrifice convenience for quality”
<Content>I stayed here for the weekend with my 10 year old daughter. I got a good rate for the hotel for under $100 a night at Priceline so I thought. First of all from the reviews I expected the Marina Tower to be a better fit so asked for an upgrade and got one from the desk agent at an unexpected extra $20 a night. Now the Marina tower is nice because it has a restaraunt, bar, starbucks and heated pool along with full service gym. However if you want a bigger room and in my opinion better views stay at the Bay tower. They have a basic lobby but if you don't need all the ammenities I previously mentioned then that place is probably the better location. The bay tower is serviced by a free shuttle. I would stay at the bay tower next time. As far as transportation service. My daughter and I relied on public transportation. The shuttle takes you to the airport where you catch the bus. Since we relied on public transportation this place was not convenient. If you plan to travel the same way choose a place closer to the hub of transportation (downtown). I rented a car the last day and found free parking on the pennisula. This is closer to the bay tower and is a cheap way to park your car. Be advised there are only about 15 free parking spaces that are 3 hour time limit but free all night after 11. All and all the hotel is nice but I wouldn't stay here if you plan on exploring San Diego. We had a "Go Card" so that is what we did. I would like to thank "Angelique" at the front desk for her professional and kind service in dealing with the charges for my room. Noise is not an issue. PLenty of computers at business center so WIFI is not necessary

<Title>“Nice hotel”
<Content>I booked a room through Hotwire and stayed one night at this hotel in San Diego. It is conveniently located near the airport and offers a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel. My room was spacious and had a nice view of the bay. Overall it was a pleasant stay. The only negative I saw was the hotel has two separate towers, the Bay and Marina Towers. My room was located in the Bay tower which is not connected to the main hotel where most of the amenities are located. It was a 3-4 minute walk to the other tower where the pool, main restaurant, Starbucks and fitness room were located. This ended up working fine for me as I was only staying one night and just walked to the main area, however if I was booking a longer stay I would request a room in the main tower. The only other negative I saw was the bathroom was a bit on the small side and had peeling wallpaper. It really needed some refreshing.

<Title>“Nice hotel. Management could use an attitude adjustment.”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sheraton for a little vacation in San Diego. The location was a bit of an issue at first because we thought it was going to be downtown, so it was further away than we thought. We fell in love with the view from our room and the girls at the concierge helped us rent a car so we could get around the city better. The beds were comfortable and our room was always spotless when we returned from sight seeing. It was also nice that there was a Starbucks in the hotel. Our only issues with this hotel was the overpriced, poor quality breakfast buffet and the unhelpful, rude hotel manager we had a run-in with. I have been all over the world and stayed in a variety of hotels, the breakfast buffet at the Sheraton wasn't even comparable to a continental breakfast at a Holiday Inn. Poorly cooked eggs and rotten fruit cost us $19 each! The other issue with the manager happened on friday night (April 8th). We were looking for parking and could not find any on one side of the hotel and the other side was blocked. We were exhausted and just wanted to get to our room. We asked a valet what the problem was and we were informed that there was a large wedding the next day that required the whole other side of the parking lot. We asked if we could valet for the same price as regular parking (Reg is $22 and Valet is $28), he said he would have to ask the manager. We pulled over and waited for a decision. The manager on duty came to our car and rudely informed us again of the wedding and that he would not valet our car for anything less than $28. We asked what we were supposed to do and he condescendingly told us we would have to park in employee parking that was very far away from the hotel and unpaved (it was raining so it was a big muddy mess). My boyfriend expressed that this was unacceptable and as guests we should have parking close the hotel. The manager then yelled at him that we would have to park there or not at all and there was nothing else he could do for us and walked away without another word. Like I said I travel quite frequently and have stayed in 5 star hotels and no-star hotels and I have never had some speak to me the way that manager did (I wish I could remember his name). Sheraton should take more care in training their entire staff to meet the needs of their guests, especially their managers. Overall the staff was very friendly and helpful, but one bad seed can ruin a nice evening.

<Title>“Disneyland or Airport Hotel”
<Content>Overall this is a nice property and a quality hotel located at the San Diego Airport. I would not rate it a business hotel, more of a family hotel you would expect to find next to Disneyland. If you have a family attending Sea World or local attractions, I recommend this hotel. It is also extremely convenient to the airport. We had issues with check-in, waiting over 2 hours in the lobby. In the hotel's defense we arrived at 1PM, so we were early. However, the desk staff said the room was available, just not cleaned. They would "call housekeeping to have it prioritized" and it would be ready within an hour. Later another person at the desk laughed and said that was crazy, Housekeeping doesn't do that. After over 2 hours, they gave me a room that was already cleaned. The biggest negative was the Club Lounge, which we paid extra to have access to. Our card key did not work, so we had to go to the desk to have it fixed (again). At breakfast it was an interstate exit Hampton Inn with at least 12-15 little kids (ages 8 and under). Wow...wiping noses and then pawing through the pastries, eating from the line, taking stacks of things...real disgusting mess. We also had an issue getting to the Lounge and central elevator because of a "closed for contrsuction" hallway, which the desk told me was incorrect, "you just must be going the wrong way". The desk staff was very unhelpful and definitely never once asked about out stay. I would have told them and moved on. Now I am just disappointed.

<Title>“Overpriced Airport Hotel”
<Content>I recently stayed at the Sheraton at the Marina (in the Marina tower) for a conference, and even if I had another conference at this hotel I would never stay here again. I paid almost $300/night to stay here and it is only worth $90. This hotel is directly across from the airport, meaning that you are kept up all night and early morning by the booming of planes taking off and landing. I reserved a high rise water view with a king bed. While I did receive a high level room with a view of the water, the water was across 2 parking lots and a street, and again right next to the airport. Not a relaxing view. On top of that I got 2 small double beds instead of a king that would in no way fit 2 adults. When I asked at check-in I was told that even though I had reserved my room 3 months before, they overbooked and were out of the rooms I had reserved. They did not offer many any compensation. There is no wireless in the rooms, and if you would like to use the plug in it is $13 day. Since it is across from the airport it is also near absolutely nothing, so unless you want to eat overpriced mediocre food at the hotel restaurant you will need to pay an expensive roundtrip cab to for all your meals or activities. I also tried asking the concierge about getting to downtown and what to do and was met with a snide comment about taxis being outside. The positives were that the rooms were kept clean, the bed was comfortable (if only one person slept in each bed), they had a good hair dryer, and their was a complimentary van to the airport (although not to downtown which would have been highly desirable). Overall I would NEVER stay at this hotel again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It is highly overpriced and marketed as a resort hotel on the water when it is really an airport hotel surrounded by streets and parking lots with a nearby boat marina and Naval facility.

<Title>“Great Hotel - wonderful view!”
<Content>This was a wonderful hotel. Very clean, very comfortable beds, nice staff. Had a great nights sleep each night. We checked in and the package we bought included a free upgrade and free breakfast. The front desk person was nice and very accomodating. We got 7th floor, king bed with a view of the bay/pool. Very nice! You can hear the airport a bit, esp. early in the morning. If you are a light sleeper, you may mind this. We got our breakfast vouchers with no problem. The breakfast buffet they had was great quality and Luis took wonderful care of us. Absolutely no problems at all. Location was good for us. We had a rental car and I think that is a good suggestion for this location. I do agree with most - the parking is crazy....$22 per night. I think if you are a guest there, they should cut you a bit of a better deal. We justified it with the free Breakfast. Pool was good. We layed by it for a few hours one day, but was too cold for us to enjoy it much. There were kids enjoying it, though!! Overall, we had a great experience!!

<Title>“Beautiful hotel on the Marina”
<Content>The hotel is located right on the Bay and a taxi ride away to the Gas Lamp district. My room was overlooking the Marina and was able to take advantage of the spectacular sunsets. The best part about staying at any Sheraton is the comfort of their beds and pillows. I stayed for 4 nights and was able to sleep great. The rooms are very modern and clean. Immediately outside of the hotel is a jogging trail along the marina that I took advantage of...beautiful trail since it's parallel to the bay. I always enjoy my stays at Sheraton's and would recommend this one as well. If you are looking for a place right in the middle of nightlife, shopping, restaurants...stay in the Gaslamp district. I went into the Gaslamp district one night...but the taxi fare was expensive for it being only 3-4 miles away.

<Title>“Nice stay in San Diego”
<Content>My husband and I made our first trip to San Diego this past weekend to visit our son who is in the Navy. We made our reservation through Expedia and I have to admit I was a little skeptical because I had never reserved a hotel that way but I must say that we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is at a great location, beautiful views and friendly staff. Our room was very comfortable. I read a couple of reviews last week that said the close proximity to the airport was a problem because of noise but my husband and I did not experience any noise problems at all. We had a marina king room and loved the view. Overall, it was a great experience and we would definitely stay at this hotel again.

Right next to the airport, down the hill from the Zoo, a nice walk to the ships/museums, right next to entrance to I-5, and what a view of the boats. My kids loved this place and the wife loved having coffee and cocktails on the balcony.

<Content>I actually joined tripadvisor for the sole purpose of reviewing this fantastic hotel! I couldn't have been happier with anything about it: lovely, comfy rooms with wonderful views, delicious food and brilliant, extremely helpful staff! If you have any qualms about booking here, I'd forget them. I couldn't recommend it enough!

<Title>“Great view and great staff!!”
<Content>I was here as part of the HP Sales training this past week. I stayed in the Bay Hotel part of this complex...its a 5 minute walk from the main marina hotel. I was upgraded to the 11th floor and it was amazing. I had a view of the bay & downtown san diego. The sunsets were to die for. i dont think you can go wrong because the view across the hall is of the marina. The staff here was VERY accomodating and friendly, from the workers at the check-in desk to the people cleaning, to the service gentleman that was on the elevator with me. It's a super intentional friendly that makes me want to come back. The only negative was that the chairs in my room had worn fabric but thats mostly a cosmetic issue. Also, its like $22/night for parking so take a cab here :) The food at the harbour island restaurant at the marina was AMAZING!!! i NEVER eat hotel food and am so glad i did there...4 star!! Also, there's a little deli in between the two hotels that had great food as well...it was a lot cheaper than the one in the hotel..$16 for an omelette ouch! Bottom Line: you'll really like this hotel and its a super quick drive downtown

<Title>“Hugely Improved”
<Content>I have stayed at this hotel many times before and I must say I was always a little disappointed in the past with the service and the general ambiance of the hotel. I stayed in mid Feb 2011. The hotel has changed dramatically for the better, it is a much more relaxing place to stay. The staff are friendlier, the rooms are comfortable. I now look forward to my next stay very much.

<Title>“A drive to downtown....... but wonderful views”
<Content>Disappointed at first not to get bay views promised but reasonably easy change to bay tower building. After a false start with a marina view and faulty cold water tap, ended up in a comfortable room with stunning bay view of San Diego Downtown across the bay and particularly attractive at night . Noises of revellers nearby were audible in hall but not in room. $22 dollar charge for parking should be obvious when booking and certainly should be mentioned at check-in. Didn't happen with us. Probably not the hotel for you if you want to experience Gaslamp nightlife. We were told it's difficult to get cabs back at night. There are however 2 restaurants at Spanish landing, 15 minutes walk away and the hotel is well placed for exploring the area in general.

<Content>We stayed here towards the end of our road trip, we got a last minute deal. Rooms were really nice, if small. Nice bathroom. We really enjoyed the pool and the beds!! The staff were nice and friendly, in particular the valets who helped pack up our car and chatted to us. We really enjoyed our stay here.

<Title>“Excellent Service”
<Content>My son left his favorite stufffed puppy at the hotel on our trip last month. He was so worried about how we would get him back. We were already at the airport, and so we called their customer service number. Nicolas in the Lost and Found department found his puppy and contacted us to let us know that he had been found. They also shipped it back to Nebraska for us free of charge. Thankfully our son only had to sleep a couple nights without "Puppy". So thankful for the extra steps the staff made on our behalf.

<Title>“Great airport Hotel”
<Content>We had a Marina tower - double room on a higher floor. The beds were very comfortable. No noise and we slept really well! At an Airport Hotel! Starbucks in Lobby! Internet in Lobby but Extra cost in room. 11$ Close to car rental and cruise terminal. Extra cost to park the car. $22 Nice restaurants in the Lobby and a very nice pool area.. Amazing view from our room of San Diego and the Bay! We had a Balcony. Even better if you have a King! We had our son along so we were nice and got a double. Great Last Night in San Diego. Went to Little Italy for Dinner very Nice.

<Title>“Four stars, I don't think so..”
<Content>This hotel nestled along the marina was a big disappointment for our family. The rooms were small, older and not the cleanest. When we booked we didn't realize the towers were in seperate locations and can be a bit confusing. The pool was the best feature as it was large and heated. Great for the kids! The beds were comfortable , the bathrooms very old.

<Title>“Appalling lack of Cleanliness”
<Content>Wonderful location, friendly and accommodating staff, beautiful grounds, great food and drinks. I had a very enjoyable time and would give this hotel four stars if it weren't for the nasty condition of the bathroom. I mean, for a four star hotel, this was truly disappointing. Please Sheraton, for the prices you charge and the lovely amenities, every part of your guest rooms should be SPOTLESS.

<Title>“Wonderful customer service!”
<Content>Upon leaving my room, I left a small but crucial part of the charger for my laptop in the outlet. Nicolas Osorio Casanova responded quickly to the call I made, and returned the needed part. He saved me time and money, and made my memory of the experience even better. Such attention encourages me to recommend this hotel to others.

<Title>“Wow! What a week!”
<Content>I have read some of the reviews below and was flabergasted to read that their visits were less than expected. I found just the opposite to be true. I believe that the service was one of the best that I have ever experienced. Everyone that I spoke to were in the business of sales which is why I was there. The smiles from the front desk down to housekeeping were a refreshing sight day to day. I was there for 6 days and never found it to be anything but this. After returning to my home I realized that I had left articles of clothing in the dresser. I immediately called and was treated pleasantly and very attentively by Sue Seirres. She was going to follow up and check the room herself but in the mean time she would transfer me to Security. At this time I met Nicolas Osorio. What a kind and very friendly voice. He as well was going to go check the room himself and would phone me back. He returned my call in less than 30 minutes and had located the items. He said that he would Fed-X them to me the next day (Saturday the 5th) But then he realized that FedX does not ship on the weekends, he called me back immediately and said they wouldn't go out until Monday. How nice was that?? I received the items this week along with a letter NOT a note from Nicolas. He wanted me to let the hotel know that the box arrived safely more specifically my 'lovely purple sweater'. he knew that this was the item I relished the most. He felt his kindness in his words of the letter. A special thanks to Nicolas and the rest of the Sheraton employees. Oh, and by the way Sue did follow up and called me shortly after Nicolas did. I travel a lot with my company and I do believe that this was the best accommodations that we have had in many years. (including DisneyWorld). Thanks Shearton for treating your guests like family.

<Title>“Very nice hotel on the Bay”
<Content>We enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton. It has a nice ambiance with the sailboat theme in the Bay Tower. It was great to have a view of the bay and a nice balcony to enjoy it on if we wanted to. We didn't notice any airport noise. The room was also set up in a unique way compared to other hotels with the bed angled outward/diagonal which gave it a more homey feel than a hotel - random thing, but both my husband and I noticed and commented on it. The parking is easy, but a little pricey for being an outdoor lot. It was really a quiet, homey hotel and I would stay there again. You do have to drive to get to the heart of downtown, but being on the water still makes it a good location.

<Title>“Noisy , nice hotel”
<Content>You would think with the airport nearby that the sound of the planes would be an issue. I wasn't . What was annoying was the noise coming from the other rooms. I could hear people using the bathrooms, flushing toilets, taking showers, and opening and closing the sliding doors, and talking. This was surprising for me. Usually, such 1st rate hotels are constructed better than this. The hotel is spotless, the staff pleasant and helpful. I did not like the idea of paying for internet access in the room. I do not feel like lugging my equipment down stairs when I want to check email. To do any kind of work, I would have had to camp out in the Lobby all afternoon. And lets not forget the parking fee. $22. So lets see, No Free Parking, NO Free Internet Access in your room, and if you are in the smaller hotel, only a cafe/bar to dine in. Will I stay here again....probably not. Would I recommend, again, probably no.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel - Too close to airport and a drive from downtown”
<Content>Beautiful hotel on the marina. Great convention facility. The hotel is right next to the airport so you get noise from the airport around the clock (not overly bad but still). Hotel is on the other side of the water from downtown so be prepared to take a taxi or rent a car. Parking at the hotel is $$$$$$ and there is not place to park for free. The rooms were beautiful and spacious.

<Title>“Bay Tower was Very Nice”
<Content>Customer service was friendly and very good in the Bay Tower. The rep greeted us warmly and upon hearing our stay was a part of our anniversary trip, she congratulated us and proactively provided us with complimentary breakfast vouchers (which included a nice buffet of eggs, meats, breads, fruits, steel cut oats, yogurts, cereals, coffee, etc.). Her generosity was not solicited or expected but was a real treat! The lobby was clean, bright, and candles were lit in the evenings. To us, these efforts indicate that the focus is on making a customerâ€™s stay as enjoyable as possible â€“ something we appreciated. The spacious room was nice and clean and decorated with a nautical theme that included vibrant reds and blues. We were allocated a room on the marina side and the views were quite serene and pleasant especially in the morning â€“ the Coronado bridge, ships, and bay were nice to view . A few things to note: internet in the rooms is not included and neither is self â€“ parking for $22. Parking we can somewhat understand as that is typically part of a nicer hotel stay but we feel the rate is rather elevated. The internet fee, however, is in our opinion outdated and unnecessary. We would venture to guess that a charge for the net may result in loss of business. Also, the refrigerator in the room is for their food and drinks only. Do not remove any of it to store your items as some sensor will automatically charge the removed items to your bill. Just some infoâ€¦ Overall, we would recommend this Sheraton because of the friendliness and customer service, clean and spacious room, and nice views. We would stay there again.

<Title>“ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Talk about hidden fees and bad service!”
<Content>My husband and I decided to do a quick weekend vacation to San Deigo. We used Priceline's "name your price option" and this was the hotel that was chosen and we paid through priceline.com. We went to check in and it was clear that the Front Desk could care less about her job and she handed us a key packet. We then soon find out that pricing is $22 dollars PER DAY for parking in their lot (and that is "self park"). Then, we realized that there are two 'towers' and the front desk associate never told us where we were suppose to park, which tower the room was in or how to get there. We finally found the room, got settled in, and pulled out the laptop to look up ideas for places to go, only to find out that it costs 12.95 PER DAY to use the internet in your room. Seriously, what hotel does not have complimentary internet?! Hole in the wall hotels even do!!! On the morning of check-out we got a bill under our door. The bill showed a $16 charge for "Other Hotel Charges". I called down to the desk and explained to the front desk lady that we paid for this room on Priceline so we should not have any charges on the room. She precedes to say that even though we paid for the room and tax through Priceline, we still had to pay some tax to them as well. I was a hotel manager so I know this was bull, but just to make sure that it wasn't some weird CA tax, I called the Holiday Inn down the street from the Sheraton and asked if there would be any additional tax charges if I booked my room online, which they obviously said NO. So, I went down to the desk and spoke to a different person and explained that we should not have any room/tax charges because we booked it through Priceline. She took the receipt, did some stuff on her computer, and handed us a new receipt with the charges taken off...without saying what those charges were actually for. The only think I could think of is that they try to stick you will just another hidden fee and try to pass it off as "tax". And, guess what? It doesn't end there..... We get home and look at our bank statement and it shows that 16 dollar fee CHARGED!! We were furious. We called the front desk and they transferred us to the accounting department. The accounting department said that they would send us a new receipt showing the "breakdown" of why we were charged, but that there were 3 people ahead of us so the email probably wouldn't go out until the next day! Are you kidding me?! Wow. We have a trip to San Deigo planned for March with family and friends and we will definitely be staying at the Holiday Inn.

<Title>“Acceptable when nothing else is available, but avoid the Bay Tower”
<Content>The Sheraton here is a standard run-of-the-mill chain hotelâ€”decent, but nothing special. Not my kind of hotel, but acceptable when there's no better choice. I stayed here because everything else was booked because of 2 conventions in town. But my biggest beef is the deceitful "bait & switch" I was subjected to! After checking into the main lobby, I was told my room was in the Bay Tower just 5 minutes' walk away. There was a pretty map of the "property" showing the two towers and the surrounding pools, so I got the impression maybe it's just one of those large resort-like properties. Well, it turns out that this is literally down the road, several commercial property blocks away, in what is a second-rate motel that was probably a Ramada Inn-level place that they bought and are selling as part of the Sheraton. The gym and pool is a joke, the lobby is not a place you can comfortably hang out in, there is no coffee kiosk or Wireless Lounge like in the main buildingâ€”but you pay the same price. The so-called view is over a parking lot towards the harborâ€”facing the naval base with turbine engines that go on till late at night. The one good thing if you have an early flight out is that it is literally next to the airport. If I had to stay here again, here's what I'd do next time: 1) Make sure my room is in the main "Marina Tower"â€”not the second-rate "Bay Tower." This matters to me because I like easy access to a coffeeshop downstairs, and a better gym and pool and hangout areas. Not that it's not a good placeâ€”but I'd rather stay at a Double Tree then, and pay accordingly and at least have warm cookie instead of those sensor refrigerators you're warned not to use or touch. 2) If I get stuck in the Bay Tower again, personally, I'd prefer the room to face the Marina instead of the harbor. Yes, the Marina side is the airport side, but I find the plane noise isn't as loud or aggravating as the non-stop turbines from the Naval base.

<Title>“Great hotel”
<Content>We had high expectations for our pre-cruise stay, and were looking forward to a couple of days of relaxation and shopping. Our room was spacious with a balcony overlooking the main pool and although not commanding the dramatic views of the higher floors, was very pleasant (given this hotel was obtained through an opaque booking option, sometimes choices are hit and miss). I am surprised at some reviews describing negative experiences with staff as we encountered nothing but friendly and very efficient service - the guest service agent who checked us in - Dinah - is a gem. The hotel location could be a somewhat negative aspect as the hotel is away from the downtown core of San Diego. However, I researched transport options and we had no trouble accessing public transit. Should you prefer a cab, it is only a 12 minute journey into the city. Given the hotel's proximity to the airport, there was little or no noise issues. We would stay here again any time.

<Title>“Read "TERRIBLE" and "POOR" Tripod reviews BEFORE you book it!”
<Content>This hotel needs to get their Customer Service "wake up" call before they realize that they have certain memebers of staff giving a proper grief, attitude and generally speaking bad customer services to their paying and valuable guests. Sadly enough I know Sheraton for the better, but this stay was a major let down! Horrible experience! We made a mistake by booking this hotel based on the Excellent reviews and we never dreamed of that we would have to agree with lots of people who rated this particular hotel as Poor or even worse Terrible. Our check-in was awful, the receptionist wasn't interested in us at all, and although they have plenty of rooms available on both sides of the hotel (the main big building!) the receptionist didn't even bother to ask us which side we would like to have, ie. Marina view or the absolutely fantastic views of the city, which we didn't get. The Concierge staff were most of the time playing with their mobile phones while we were there, only when you let them know by calling them they would respond to you and then they will acknowledge you. The soap and shampoo were unreplenished and heavily underestimated, and we were left the dirty glasses in our room for days! We have to contact them several times for the soap and shampoo and it arrived there several hours later! When you go half way around to World on a holiday of a lifetime the last thing you need is to be annoyed and frustrated with the basic, small things issues and problems which shouldn't have happened in normal circumstances and with professional members of staff. Some of the staff appeared to us as either new and unsufficiently trained, or just not happy with their job or whatever else is in the background. The room service was slow, and once they appeared they were even slower as they had a new guy in the room service departpment who was to receive his training - in front of us in the evening! This was a horrible experience as we have just landed after a very long flight! Unfortunately the senior member of the room service failed to spot this and unfortunatelly we were left with no other option than to participate in that Circus de la Room Service! Once we finished our meal we called the room service to pick up their trolley, they just told us to drive the trolley out and leave it there, which stayed there for the whole night. They first picked up the trolley in the morning in front of our door. However, once they've picked up the trolley, another room service attendant hours later came to our door banging and asking us for the trolley from a previous night, to our great astonishment! We've told him that the trolley had been picked up by someone else. He was very grumpy in his search for that trolley and he didn't even apologise to us for the disturbance he made. He walked away muttering something to himself. Shocking experience! Chocolate from the mini-bar incident: Wow! This episode is a top notch of BAD Customer Services!! Honestly! WOW! On our 1st night we took a chocolate from our room's mini-bar, and to our great astonishment, the chocolate had expired MONTHS ago! Clearly we were not happy with it, and on our discovery some other products had been expired too! As the mini-bar in the rooms is touch-sensitive, we had try to communicate this to the room service and the front desk, but without any success! So, a trip to the reception in a middle of a night was needed to try and get another chocolate from either them or room service or something like that. The night receptionist failed to understand what the problem was, she wasn't interested in our problem what so ever!! We have explained to her that we don't want to be charged for it so if she can make sure of that, and if we can get someone to replenish other products from the mini-bar asap. Our request fall on death ears, the girl just didn't have a clue what I was on about, and she kept asking me to comeback tomorrow to the reception or to get hold of someone in the room service, but first the following day?!?! She had a proper attitude, so it was best to leave the argument there. Oh my God, the following day our HORRIBLE customer experience continiued!!! WOW!! Someone from the housekeeping came banging at our door, and we have asked her to comeback later as it was very early and it was a proper inconvenience. She spoke very limited English so clearly she did NOT understand what we were telling her. As soon as we realized that the lingustics are the issue we have tried to simplyfy our message to her. Then she walked away. Not even half an hour later she came around again, the same housekeeper, claiming that the room service send her. We didn't want her in the room at that time as we were still asleep but we felt that we didn't have a choice as she muttered something to us that she is busy! WOW! Like we care?? What a stressful event. And yet it did not end here. We have struggled to understand to communicate to her what the problem was about the mini-bar as it is was very obvious to us that the night receptionist did not tell her the whole story! Shocking. So, we have spent good 15 minutes explaining to this lady that we didn't touch or eat or drunk ANYTHING from the mini-bar, she claimed that we did as it was missing, and then we told her that she must seek that missing chocolate bar from the reception!! She was very suspicious, and she muttered something to herself, something which we didn't understand, in Spanish! She was visibly upset about the whole thing although we have tried to explain to her in a very plain language so she did understand what we were telling her. Then all of sudden she started to complain to us that she doesn't understand English very well, and that she will send someone else. We felt sorry for this woman in a way, but we were upset at the same time about how this could have happened, this great misscommunication between the departments. This housekeeper sent from the room service wanted to charge us for the expired chocolate from the mini-bar. No one ever came later on to replenish other expired products from the mini-bar and we have never ever touched that mini-bar again. We never received a call or any message of acknowledgment from anyone from anywhere from the hotel, so we were left in uncertainty about the whole mini-bar experience until we have received our final invoice where we have registered that they did not charge us for the mini-bar products. Awful experiences, constant frustrations, desperation, bad customer services and what else not!! Soon after this room service left our room we were to go to bed again, however that wasn't possible as another housekeeper kept knocking at our door to clean the room although we did have a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door!!!! She came around twice and she realized we were not up then she said she will come back later. She too muttered something to herself and appeared not to be happy because of our presence in the room. The same incident happened the following day too. Awful! On a check out from this hotel the lack of same interest for the paying and valuable guests like us was the same as we entered the hotel, awful, nothing, appaling! Even when we stayed at the 2 or 3 stars places the members of staff were very warm, hospitable, very friendly and kind to us. The room we had didn't have the city view and that was a major let down, although we must emphasize that the rooms are lovely (in the main building!). I can follow to some extent what other critics wrote about the design and furniture of this hotel, however, our main objective and at the same time a total FAILURE of those were lack of friendly and welcoming stuff, appaling customer services and never going and extra mile for a customer!! A major disappointment, frustration, desperation and what else not! We made a major mistake by booking this hotel! The room and the building is nice, they even have Starbucks there which I was quite pleased about it, the area, the lobby is okay and the views around the hotel are nice, but what's the point when you have your holiday and mood ruined by rude members of staff with a proper attitude and no clue what so ever??!! It is a real shame as our money will now go to someone else instead of Sheraton in San Diego! If they don't appreciate your business, well, there are plenty of other competitors who will do anything for you and your valuable revenue!! You don't travel half away around the World on a holiday of a lifetime to get crappy and appaling customer services and attitude, that's just plain WRONG!! :(( And if you're lucky you'll get one of those PR-letters from the Management saying how surprised and sorry they are about your experience and how they hotel pride itself to be the best and blah blah blah, and they will just wish you all the best! What a joke! We won't stay there ever again until the things change DRAMATICALLY for the better, obviously!! Sheraton other places maybe, but this one, no way! One girl from the Concierge and one guy from the Starbucks were the only people who smiled at us once and that's about all the smiley and happy faces in Sheraton we've got during our several days long stay there!

<Title>“Nice place, friendly staff”
<Content>I recently stayed here for five nights and overall, was very pleased with the hotel. Yes, the hotel is not in the downtown area. But, there are two buses that stop a five minute walk away that go directly to downtown. As well, there is a nice walking path (that is safe) that is about 4 km to the heart of the city. I only took one cab the entire visit. There are lovely running trails right out of the hotel.The gym was fantastic as well. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and polite. I also found the service in the bar area to be superb. Room service was expensive, but that is to be expected. The room was spacious and clean, although I could not be given a king bed because I had made the booking on priceline. I would advise anyone who is a light sleeper to choose to stay on the marina side. The side that overlooks the city is closest to the airport and was quite noisy on my first night. But, the front desk let me change rooms after the fist sleepless night. There were some cons to this place. The hotel is promoting this "green" concept that is supposed help the environment with reducing waste with washing of linens. If you sign up for this program, you get a five dollar voucher to use at the hotel in return for not getting your sheets and towels washed. I felt this program was pushed on me and I felt bad declining it. What they do not mention is that "going green" means that housekeeping doesn't even enter your room for your stay. My garbage was loading up and I put them outside of my room to get emptied, only for them to completely disappear. As well, there are complimentary teas in the room that would normally be topped up if housekeeping was in daily. Because they weren't, I had to get my own tea from Starbucks which was how I ended up spending my five dollar voucher. I'm all for going green, but I believe this is just a ploy for the hotel to save money on staff and cleaning rather than saving the environment. All I was left with was a dirty room with an unmade bed. I will not be doing this initiative in the future. I will just ask housekeeping not to change the sheets and keep my towels on the racks. My second complaint was when I switched rooms the first night because of the airplane noise, I ended up being in a room that had a door directly connecting my suite to another suite. I could hear practically every breath of the people next door, some of which was quite embarrassing. Make sure you request a room without a door connection in it. It is really kind of archaic and I did not feel safe as I was travelling alone and the door only had a cheap looking lock on it. All in all, I paid 75 dollars a night for the room. I got what I paid for. Nothing more, nothing less. I will say that the staff were great!

<Title>“Excellence base for a weekend getaway”
<Content>Great Hotel for the money! The front desk personnel is very helpful! Hats off to Melissa and Blanka at front desk for going the extra mile and making our weekend extra special. We stayed at the bay tower, the balconies and the rooms are a little bit bigger I noticed. Excellent view either side of hotel. Rooms need an update, but kept very clean, so you really don't care. Maryann B. in the spa is excellent! She really knows what she is doing! I did the Reflexology and she was the very best! We live in Vegas and go to all the strip hotels for spa services. She is really awesome! Service in the resturants is top notch. Very helpful, Rebecca at the breakfast buffet gave some really nice suggestions and directions! The breakfast buffet for the price should have made to order omelets and waffles. Miss that! Dined in the Harbor View for dinner, Service was excellent and prompt, but for the price and quality of food I would look into one of the more upscale Gaslamp district or some of the fresh fish resturants just down the street. The Hotel is situated on it own Island kinda (park like) Great neighborhood. Overall this hotel is great for a nice quite upscale getaway! I would recommed this hotel!

<Title>“Not a bad base”
<Content>The hotel is right next to the airport, so it's probably best for those who are either stopping over briefly, or those who plan to drive around anyway and just use it as a base for a short stay (which is what I did). Despite the proximity to the airport, I didn't notice the planes at all. There are two hotels - Marina and Bay Hotel - the Marina is definitely the better of the two. The hotel itself was comfortable and the rooms spacious and the one I had had a nice view over the marina. Compared to other hotels I experienced on the same trip, I thought this one was fairly cheap and pretty good value for money. In summary it had what I needed - no more, no less.

<Title>“The hotel & staff were great but...”
<Content>The hotel was very nice. The staff were friendly, especially the Shuttle Driver, Shane, he was very respectful and sweet. My only complaint was the location and the limited transportation options. The only options were cab or shuttle services. Car rental parking was excessive. No access to any of the public transportation services. No hotel shuttle services to local attractions. You can only use the shuttle service to go to/from the airport, it did not take you anywhere else. I have stayed in other hotels in San Diego that offers those services and close to public transportation.

We found the room to be spacious with a nice view of the marina and excellent furnishings, plasma TV, and modern nautical decor. The pool, jacuzzi, and fitness club were lovely.

<Title>“beautiful & fantastic service!”
<Content>I was at the Sheraton for only one night so I didn't get to experience any of its many amenities, including the beautiful outdoor pool and tennis courts. I had been traveling all day and was exhausted, and was so happy to have a nice, comfortable, quiet hotel room to crash in. And the service was awesome! I had left a bottle of lotion in the room the following morning--something pretty small, but I did want it back--and Nicolas from Lost & Found was super helpful in locating it. He found it, Fedexed it to me for free, and I got it back right away. So...beautiful location, comfortable, and wonderful, helpful staff...definitely recommend this hotel!

<Title>“Excellent hotel, with a very courteous staff”
<Content>Excellent first rate hotel with a very courteous staff! we checked in for our anniversary in Octoberr and were told that the hotel was overbooked - and that they did not have a room in the bay tower that night - however they did find a last minute accommodation for the night and then upgraded us to the penthouse suite for the next 2 nights - it was excellent service all around after that. The front desk went out of their way to make this happen and they had no incentive to do it for us - they could have very well given us another room - I believe the person on the front desk that night was Eduardo (but I do not recollect his name). It was a 2000sq ft penthouse and the huge balcony has excellent views of the San Diego skyline. the marina is just steps away from the hotel and you can plan to watch a romantic sunset by the oceanside in rather silence. also, we were given free parking and breakfast vouchers for all 3 days of our stay - now that was surely a royal treatment. Thanks for making it a special vacation for us! We left a small bottle of champagne as a token of appreciation!

<Title>“Sheraton's name and motel 6 quality”
<Content>My family just stayed there for 2 nights and I would never come back to this hotel. My decision to stay in this hotel was base on the beautiful photos from their website but be carefully, there is a bait and switch, when we arrive the hotel, we were sent to another property called "bay tower". The stuff was nice and friendly and when I asked what's the difference between "bay tower" and main hotel. I was told "the room here is 35% larger than main hotel". After we got into the room, we turned on the heater and we all fall asleep until we waked by cold. The heater is not working. called the guest service more than 5 times and no one pick up the phone. I had to go to front desk and tell them that the heater is not working. Almost 1 hour later, a engineer came and fixed the heater. When I asked him to make sure the heater won't break again, he told me to call guest service again if it breaks again. Around 10:30pm, we found that there is no hot water in the bathroom. called guest service more than 5 times and finally somebody picked up the phone and told me that she will send a engineer to my room to check out. more than 30 minutes later, no one shows up and nobody picks up the phone call. Went down the front desk and was told "the boiler is broken and engineer is working on it. no ETA'. we waited another hour and went to bed without taking shower. On the second day, I requested to move to the main hotel. The lobby is beautifully and full of guests and activities. The restaurant is great and feels so warm. After we got back to our room around 8;30pm, we found that the heater is NOT working in our room. called front desk and was told a engineer is on the way. 45 minutes later, no one shows up and I went down to the front desk and was told there were 5 more calls in front of me and their engineer is working very hard to fix the issues and I have to wait. Another 30 minutes later, a guy came in and fix the heater. (not sure if he really fixed or not, before the fix, the temperature shows 65 and after the fix, the temperature shows 71 max. We set it to 74 but never exceed 71) I requested to talk to their manager but was told that the manager was too busy and I only can talk to him after middle night. I was offered one day free parking because of above horrible experience.

<Title>“Family Trip to San Diego”
<Content>This hotel was not bad but not great either. The location was okay. It had nice views but I don't think it's in the best part of town. The hotel overall was clean and looks like it's going through an update. I couldn't tell if our room was an updated room or not. It seemed on the older side. The bathroom was very small and the hairdryer did not work. I left a note asking for a replacement from housekeeping. They took the old one but did not leave a replacement. My big issue was with the service. Everyone was nice but not very competent. When I checked in I asked about an upgrade. I received an email from the hotel prior to arriving offering the opportunity to upgrade for a fee if a room was available. I selected the upgrade I wanted and submitted my credit card information. When I checked in the person at the front desk was not familiar with this but said she could offer me an upgrade. I told her I wanted to stay on the club level. She ended up putting us in the Bay Tower which doesn't offer the club level which was annoying because I paid for this upgrade. I discovered the error the next morning when I called to inquire where the club room was. The person on the phone had to add the club level access to our reservation. He only agreed to do this after I complained about the confusion at check in and the fact that I requested a wake up call but never got one. Overally, I can't complain too much because I got the room for only $79/night (before the extra $20/night for the upgrade). But had I paid more than $100 I would have been mad. This hotel is not worth more than what I paid. Lastly, the $22/night charge for self parking was ridiculous.

<Title>“We loved it!”
<Content>Beautiful property, very good maintained, we loved the maritime design of the rooms. Lovely little balcony with the marina view made our evenigs perfect. ( plus a bottle of califorian red wine ) :) Flat screen TVs, the best beds I have ever experienced on my US travels. Nice bathrooms too. The location is not quite central but I think there is a shuttle to the city ( we had our own car ) The hotel is perfectly clean. Minifridge, Coffe maker and great starbucks coffee instedd of the cheap coffee you alwas get in a hotel. Staff were nice. The property is located just next to the airport so if you are sensitive to airplane noise you better think twice about staying there. On the other hand, being an aircraft fan as I am, you will appreciate the close view to the starting and landing aircrafts from your balcony. There is no noise though if you keep the balcony doors closed. Bad things - 22 $ parking charge a night. No complimentary internet. Quite a distance to the city. However, we had a lovely 2 nights stay there and we will definitely stay there again while visiting San Diego next year. Highly reccomended!

<Title>“Wonderful hotel, albeit a bit isolated”
<Content>The Sheraton Marina was a fabulous hotel. Our room was huge, the decor and condition of the hotel was wonderful, and the staff were very helpful and friendly. We had one small complaint (our peek viewer in the door was reversed - you could not see out of the room, but those in the hall could peek in - the thing was installed in reverse!) but it was fixed in minutes. And close-by the Boathouse Restaurant, recommended by hotel staff, offered great food and very decent prices. Hotel car parking is very pricey, but we dumped the car and enjoyed the neighbourhood. That's the one thing you must remember. The Hotel is too far from downtown to walk reasonably, so a tixi ride is a must if you want to go there.....and you should. San Diego is a great city with lots to see and do.

<Content>My wife and I took the kids to Sea World and stayed here. We received a great price through priceline, but was skeptical after reading some reviews. Don't judge a book by its cover. Upon arriving we were immediately impressed. The location was great and we had a high room with a great view. The staff were extremely polite. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Very Disappointing, will never stay here again”
<Content>I stay at the hotel for 4 nights as I attended a conference that was hosted at the hotel. When we arrived in my room I found there was no Safe in the room, called reception and they sent security up to check but he also could not find the Safe, I then asked to be move to a room with a safe and they said it was not possible to do a room swap, yet 10 mins before when I check-in the person at reception gave me a few room that I could choose from. I found the hotel to be very average considering it should be a 4 star hotel. They don't even offer free in room internet, yet I stayed at a 3 Star Holiday Inn in New York and they offer it.The only good thing I found was the GYM. Now I needed my final invoice and I have been trying for more then a week to get it. I cannot believe this sort of service from a Sheraton hotel. Due to teh fact that I went on business I cannot claim the stay back from my company was I have not recieved my invoice yet. Unbelievable. Will never stay there again.

<Content>Erin from the Front Desk/Guest Services is the bomb diggity! I called in to make a special request on Thanksgiving for a loved one that was spending the holiday far from home and by himself because he was working. I contacted the hotel in hopes of surprising him when he checked in at 10pm for a holiday treat. Erin made it happen! Not only did she find pumpkin pie and send it to his room and made an adorable card she made his holiday special and memorable! Now that is what I call service! I have worked for upscale hotels (different chain) for years and wish I had more employees like Erin and the crew she enlisted to make a special Thanksgiving for a loved one that was far from home. Thank you Erin!! Happy Holidays to you!!!

<Title>“Pretty good for what I paid”
<Content>My wife and I stayed in the Marina Tower on Saturday November 20th. We thought it might not be too busy on the weekend before Thanksgiving but it was quite full. We got this hotel for a priceline bid of $65 and given the choice between the second floor or paying $20 for the top floor we opted for the top floor. The view of the bay and city skyline from our room was incredible. There was a storm passing that night and we got great pictures of the city with the changing weather. Being close to the airport we could hear the jets taking off but we brought a fan with us for white noise and had no trouble sleeping. The room was average sized and the bed was a bit firm but not overly so. The bathroom was clean and the only thing missing was a vent fan. The balcony had 2 chairs and a small table. Although I hate to pay for parking, from previous stays around downtown San Diego the $22/day fee was par for the course. The parking lots are off to the side of the main enterance and can get congested at times. The overflow parking is not paved and was a bit muddy during the storm. Overall it was a good value for what we paid. We only left the hotel to attend a football game at Qualcomm Stadium and had no trouble getting to and from I-5. With this in mind not being close to restaurants, shops, etc. was not a big issue; but, would prefer to stay in downtown within walking distance of the Gas Lamp Quarter otherwise.

<Title>“Just fine for the price”
<Content>We got a great deal on Hotwire for this hotel. We were in the Bay Tower, in a requested high up room with terrace facing the Bay and the Air Force Base, and to the left, the downtown skyline. The room colors were red, white and blue, in keeping with the Military base theme. Room was clean, beds comfortable. Front desk folks were pleasant and helpful. We walked to the Marina building for coffee, and in the opposite direction for a late night restaurant (cant recall the name) but there is not much else in walking distance. The weather was gorgeous and we loved being right on the bay. However, since nothing much is in walking distance, so if you want to be in downtown San Diego, or Coronado, you'er better off picking a place there. For us, the location was fine as we wanted to visit points both north(la Jolla) and South of the airport. Room was clean and roomy enough. Free internet in both lobby and business center--a big plus. There's nothing per se wrong with the hotel, but next timeI'd probably choose a different hotel in a more residential area, such as Coronado.

<Title>“Great Location - Service Okay”
<Content>My husband and I stayed for 4 nights for a conference. It's extremely close to the airport and you can hear the jets. "Luckily" the air conditioner was loud enough to drown out the noise. Checking in was okay. The guy didn't know anything about our conference which was happening at the hotel and didn't offer to direct us to the concierge. They have an area with about 8 pc's & a printer in a livingroom type area. But if you want internet in your room it's going to cost you $9-15/day depending on which type you get. They also have a pc setup us for getting your airline boarding pass. Our room was pretty good. Not as clean as I hoped; I found a big long hair in the tub and the crevices of the bathrrom needed a thorough deep clean. The theme of the room is nautical. We had a nice view but had to haul our suitcase up 2 flights of stairs as there wasn't an elevator near our room. Strange, but I guess it's an older property. The bed wasn't all that comfortable for a Sheraton. We had a nice balcony with 2 chairs and a nice view of the marina. There was a flat screen and the cable had a good selection of channels including a nice selection of international news stations like the Russian news channel. We didn't eat breakfast in the restaurants and our conference was catered for lunch. Really nice catering job by the hotel. The food was really, really good and the staff was friendly & efficient. On our last day, after checking out we decided to have lunch at the hotel pub. It took freaking forever (like an hour!) for a salad and a sandwich! They said that the kitchen was really busy but it was 1pm and I'm sure it's busy everyday at lunch time. You'd think they would have scheduled more staff durring that time. We barely made it to our flight. They have 2 pools and a beautiful waterfall and fountains going into the main pool. They also have a pretty large hot tub. We didn't bring our suits and were pretty bummed that we couldn't go in. They have a fitness center but we didn't use it. The friendliest people at the hotel were the valet & catering staff. The location is pretty central. We saved money by just taking cabs as hotel parking is $18/day. For 5 days we spent about $150 on cabs. A one-way cab ride to downtown is about $15 with tip. They also have a free airport shuttle. Overall, I'd stay there again but I'd make sure we got a really good price.

<Title>“Bay Tower Customer Service”
<Content>I and my son stayed in the tower one night. Nove 29-30 part of a wedding party.( I have a receipt.) My Rep. was Kory. Her attitude and disposition was terrible. I was sent to room 388, I opened the door, a man jump from the bed. I went back to Kory and told her there was a man in our room. Her answer was, you are the only one booked in that room. I am telling her there's a man there and she's insisting no one should be there. Our room #194 had no exhaust in the btroom and there was mold at the top of the shower. At check out I bought the issue up and was told about security, computer mix-up and such. Too much information. She never apologized. It seem the problem was my fault. Will never stay there again.

<Title>“Don't let them put you in the Bay Tower!”
<Content>Booked this and was excited about the property... but got there and learned that there is a nice building and a junky building. What it looks like is that the Sheraton bought a competitor and then send their lower-paying guests to that building. Leaky faucet in the tub, antiquated tube-televisions, grubby elevators, and minimal services. If you are willing to get up and walk the to the other building, you can use their nice pool and their spa and their large gym and their pool table and their ping-pong tables and their fountains and their aquarium and their beautiful wood panelled lobby and their in-house Starbucks and their sculptures and their artworks ... but if not, you get the lame pool, no spa, a gym with old equipment, and a white no-frills utilitarian lobby.

<Title>“Not a good experience”
<Content>We stayed for one night at this hotel and that was enough. From the start of our arrival the parking was a nightmare. Checking in was a bit long but quick when we finally got up to the counter. Our first room was on the 4th floor on the end over looking the jacuzzi. The room was large but that is all the goods things I have to say about it. There was a huge red stain on the carpet when we walked in. The people in the room next to us were so loud we could just about hear their whole conversation. I called the front desk and requested to be moved. They told us the hotel was sold out. So I decided to take a towel from the bathroom to close the gap under the door that adjoined the rooms. There was a huge black hair on the towel so once again I called and requested to be moved. They told us to come back to the front desk and they would have another room for us. Our second room was on the 3rd floor and we had a lovely view of the parking lot. The room was much smaller than our first. We immediately noticed there was black hair all over the bathroom floor. We had problems with the shower working correctly and had more water coming out the faucet than we did the shower head. It took a good 10 minutes for the shower to drain before the next person could shower. We were unable to find the TV remote, after calling the front desk it took them 30 minutes to bring us a new one at 1:30AM. To top things off a car alarm starting going off at 5AM. Needless to say this was the worst hotel experience. I booked the room through priceline which was the first mistake. They were not helpful in resolving the issues after we returned home and said there was nothing they could do. I've emailed the hotel and no response. I was given the name and number for Riquel and have called and left her 3 messages with no response. There are plenty of other hotels close to the San Diego Airport and I would caution you to stay here.

<Title>“This Sheraton hotel is awesome!”
<Content>My family and friends (9 of us total) stayed several days at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina located at 1380 Harbor Island Drive, San Diego, for our son's U.S. Marines Corps graduation at the MCRD. We were all extremely happy with the fabulous location of the hotel. The views of the marina from the hotel are spectacular! The hotel is extremely close to all the major San Diego tourist attractions and the airport, which makes it very easy to access. In addition, we were very impressed with Sheraton's excellent customer services, their extremely helpful concierge, and providing us with all the creature comforts you could find in an upscale 5 star hotel. Not to mention they have a Starbucks in-house - Totally Awesome! Two great restaurants, a super nice gym, an amazing spa, and so much more..... If you are going to stay in San Diego, be it just for fun or for serious business, the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina is the place to stay.

<Title>“It was an Awesome weekend at the Sheraton Marina Hotel!”
<Content>My wife and I spent a very wonderful weekend at the Sheraton Marina. The Staff was great and catered to our every need. The activity facilities were well kept and very accessable. At night we walked the grounds and took in the beauty of the city and the surrounding harbor. The dinning was pleasant and the food wonderful. Thank you Sheraton for providing such a great service and creating some cherished memories. Sincerely Yours, Hector Hernandez

<Title>“Great hotel, great views, awesome pool and food.”
<Content>We loved our stay at the Sheraton. Perfect location for all the site seeing we did. Yummy food at the hotel and great restaurants around the area. My son loves planes so we could occassionally see planes flying by without the noise I would have thought there would be. They also had a great breakfast buffet and the kids ate free! Now that is a great deal! We loved playing at the pool. We had wished there would have been service still at the pool for drinks and food. Overall we loved our stay at the hotel. Fun memories with a hassle free stay.

<Title>“far from enchanting and a trap for folks without rental cars”
<Content>the hotel has two towers: the nice "marina" tower and the stepchild "bay" tower, a five minute walk between the two. the hotel is a cab ride from everything, poorly appointed and has minimal ammenities. twice, i've stayed here for a conference held in the marina tower. both times, I booked the conference tower and was - without any notice - moved to the bay tower. so I have to either hoof it to the marina tower or wait 15 minutes for a shuttle. not ideal and not what I reserved. customer service when I complained about the switch today I got a "we're sorry" and the manager tried to shift the blame to me for not booking with the conference block. no offer for free in-room internet or anything else. when I tried to order delivery for dinner, I found there was no directory of delivering restaurants and no phone book. I got a phone book and made some calls but no one delivered to this location. upon calling the front desk to request options, I was told to go online. (she assumed I was paying $12/day for in-room internet). when I explained I had no internet, she told me to come to the lobby and use their computer. really? ammenities 1 vending machine in the whole hotel, overpriced mini-bar or over-priced gift shop. you can't walk to anything so they have you at their mercy. "free wifi" in the lobby? yeah, but only an hour and you have to agree to pay for overtime when signing in. wifi in room? nope, but you can pay $12/day for wired service. bottom line if you've got a car, you might be fine here. if you're walking, you'll feel trapped and taken advantage of.

<Title>“Nice Stay... could be better”
<Content>My stay here was just fine. It was not great it was not horrible. I can say what I did not like most about this hotel was the fact that it does not have wireless in the room. What year is it? Seriously.... wireless should be standard in all business hotels. The room was fine... it was not bad, it was not amazing. The location, while has some great views... is so far away from the city. Its not within walking distance of anything... beyond the airport. The gym was really nice and the pool looked great. Would I stay here again... it all depends. If my event was at the hotel, I guess I would stay here again. Thus I say I would recommend this hotel. However, would I choose to stay here again, no.

<Title>“Two Hotels, One Name”
<Content>I was a bit confused when reading reviews for this hotel prior to my trip. My hope is to ease this confusion with my review and photos posted. The Sheraton is actually two hotels, one call Marina and one called Bay. They each have separate check in desks, separate parking lots and separate facilities. The hotels are connected by a sidewalk that takes an adult walking quickly 6-7 minutes from one location to the other. The Marina appears to be the newer of the two and offers upgraded facilities. The pool, whirlpool and fitness room are far superior to the Bay hotel. This hotel fronts a very upscale marina. pricing for items like food reflect this. Saturday brunch was $19 pp, more in line with upscale hotel pricing but delivering basic offerings. The airport is just across the street, convenient but also noisy from 6am-9pm. The Bay hotel offers larger rooms, but is a more sterile and noisy inside. Make sure to get a room viewing the bay not the airport. Stayed five nights and prefer the marina location. Self parking at $22 is another way to get more money from guests. It is not well guarded at the Bay hotel.

<Title>“Nice hotel with GREAT staff!”
<Content>We took our 3 yr old to San Diego the last week of June and stayed at this hotel. Hotel is adequately furnished. The hotel staff was excellent, always accommodating and helpful. We requested a refrigerator to store my son's milk, etc. It was promptly provided. A couple of months later the hotel charged my c/c for the fridge and removed it once I complained that a charge was never communicated to me. Very happy with their service.

<Title>“A very nice stay at Priceline prices”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton marina 10/2- 10/25 ( 4 nights). There are two properties on site- the Bay and the Marina towers. Both are nice, we stayed int eh Bay tower. I think those are the Priceline rooms. The room was Sheraton quality. The staff was great. all went well. There is a $22 per night parking charge though. So make sure you keep that in mind. The hotel is well situated near the airport, with an ongoing complementary airport shuttle service.

<Title>“Excellent location!!!!”
<Content>I booked my stay through Priceline and have to admit that I was somewhat hesitant after reading other reviews. However, I found my stay in the Bay Tower at the San Diego Sheraton to be extremely pleasant. All staff members were friendly and helpful. I had a room in the Bay Tower looking out to the bay. The view from my balcony was incredible and the room was nice and the bed extremely comfortable. Steve in the Bay Tower Lounge was great as was Lucia who I saw each morning in the Bay Tower restaurant while I was having breakfast. Both these employees are definitely an asset to Sheraton. I would definitely stay at this hotel again when I visit San Diego on my next trip.

<Title>“Great Hotel with a great view!”
<Content>I spent two nights at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina, recently during the American Society of Anesthesiology conference. I didn't get to spend too much time at the hotel or in the room due to my commitment with the annual conference, but I do have to say that I was very pleased with my stay. I liked my room very much. It was very nice and comfortable. My view of the San Diego harbor was superb. It made me miss living in California. Also, it was a very easy and convenient shuttle ride to and from the hotel. On my last night, before leaving back to Miami, I stopped at the Tapatini bar inside the hotel's lobby. I met a very friendly and personable bartender by the name of Scott. I got to talking with him for a while and I was very impressed by his recommendations of appetizers, tapas and specialty martini's they offered. I really had no idea that they offered such delicious drinks and food at this fun and reasonably lively bar. Overall, I had a very pleasant stay there in San Diego at the Sheraton Marina.

<Title>“Ok stay, not ideal”
<Content>I booked this hotel through Priceline - - unfortunately it is considered part of â€œdowntown and the gaslamp zoneâ€�- - (where I really wanted to stay). There are two towers to this hotel that are a block or so away.... we were placed in the Bay Tower which much lesser of a hotel and is NOT a FOUR star hotel. The hotel was ok - the rooms were fine but the hotel was more like a 3 or 3.5. There was no where to eat or get a drink, you had to walk or take a shuttle to the other tower. The swimming pool was a joke and very out dated. The coffee pot in our room was so disgusting - the inside was brown (where the water goes) and I tried to clean it but it was still nasty. I told the front desk and when we returned that night they had brought a brand new coffee pot. We had a harbor view and it was very nice, we got to see sailboats etc. It was relaxing. The room was fine and the bed was comfy. This hotel is a $15 cab ride from downtown / gaslamp which was a huge inconvenience for us. There is nothing to do and no where to eat or drink around this hotel so expect to drive or grab a cab to do anything. If you are looking for an ok hotel, with a comfy bed and nice view - this is for you. Otherwise, it is a bit of a let down and the star rating needs to be reviewed. Oh and they do have a shuttle from the airport to the hotel. We didnâ€™t know and paid $10 for a cab.

<Title>“Very pleasant stay”
<Content>Stayed in the Marina Tower [more convenient, in my opinion, to the hotel's services, including its airport shuttle, than the Bay Tower] for 2 nights 10/15/10 and 10/16/10; beautiful views of Downtown from the small but adequate balcony. Room was clean and had all the amenities needed, but not luxurious. Common areas of the hotel are nicely decorated, and the staff at check-in was quite cheerful. One plus is the free airport shuttle, which one can use to connect with Metro bus 992 to get downtown. One note: since the hotel is isolated on a small spit of land [the marina], there are no restaurants within walking distance, which the Sheraton's restaurants capitalize on [high prices], so expect to pay $16 for a hamburger or $38 for an ala carte strip steak.

<Title>“Great Hotel, Great Amenities, Great Location and the Best Customer Service Ever!”
<Content>From the moment I called for reservations, I felt like the staff were good friends . They strived to please us, and demonstrated above and beyond customer service. Our guest service agent, Roseann Schaefer, listened to my requests and needs for accomodations due to a recent illness and major surgery. She is awesome, and the best guest service agent we ever talked with ever! I will come back to this hotel just because of her! That's how great she was to us! She upgraded our room and had a fruit plate delivered to us upon check in! Every employee we encountered during our stay was so friendly and helpful. The concierge happily answered questions and offered to arrange for rental car, provide tickets to attractions at a discounted price. We have never encountered such excellent customer service at any other hotel ever, and we frequently travel! Way to go, Sheraton! The fitness center is a dream come true, with top notch new, smooth Life Fitness machines. This is our fav hotel in San Diego, and we will return again and again. Thank you, Sheraton, for a wonderful stay, beautiful views, comfy accomodations, super staff and great location! Don't miss the all the yacht lights reflecting on the water at night! Stunning view from the balcony at night in the Marina Tower. We're already planning another trip here! Hint--request the Marina Tower with views of the bay and marina. Views are great!

<Title>“Complete failure!”
<Content>I laugh as I write this because this place is such a joke! First off the rooms look like Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren got together, had a demon spawn baby, then that baby designed a hotel. Kitsch all the way. I understand it's by a marina, but do I have to feel like I'm on a boat too? We confirmed a king room, but were placed in a two double room. When confronted about this they apologized in the most unaffected way and said that they were sold out, but we could move tomorrow. Really? Not acceptable. We asked for our room to be made up. There was a maid 2 doors down. 2.5 hours, 2 calls, a chat with the manager on duty and another 30 minutes and it was FINALLY cleaned. Again, unaffected apology. As SPG Platinum members we were neither recognized as such, nor given any of the required benefits associated with our status until the SPG Platinum Concierge called the hotel. Then we had to have our keys remade so that we had access to the club level lounge which should have been done to begin with. Internet is wired and only available at the desk which was slightly annoying. Overall, terrible experience. Stay down the road at the Hilton. I'm sure it's MUCH better. Meanwhile, word to the hotel: Learn how to treat your top tier guests, as well as your corporate guests who bring you quite a bit of revenue. Also, for the love of God, hire a decorator. Your hotel looks ridiculous.

<Content>Our townhouse room over looking the ocean a big plus, well maintained and clean hotel. The Marina breeze is energizing and the view is beautiful as you enjoy a wonderfully tasty breakfast the Sheraton offers for $19 per person. Itâ€™s a great place to go for a central location near beaches, downtown nightlife and the airport for commuting. I love to go there very relaxing! It's incredible the unique variety in resturants to fit any size budget.

<Content>this is one of the best location & hotels in San Diego. there are a lot of nearby places to visit & good restaurants to try out. It has two towers, so it has 2 pools that can serve both sides of travelers in case it gets really packed in summer time. though the room services are below average where they don't answer your call or not bring items up to your room even you tried to called 3 times. other than that, it's a good one.

<Content>The room was clean and very comfortable. We got two rooms. One was overlooking the marina and one overlooked the ocean. We couldn't decide which view was better. We had a couple minor issues with the staff at the front desk so we only rated the staff a 3 out of 5. Also the parking was more expensive than we expected for the area (not a downtown hotel). We would stay at the hotel again.

<Title>“The best of the best!”
<Content>SERVICE, SERVICE, SERVICE!!! Did I mention the service? This was my first stay at the Sheraton, and it will not be my last. I simply will not stay anywhere else in San Diego. There was a problem with my reservation, and Brian at the front desk had it fixed within two minutes! The staff was amazingly attentive, yet not intrusive. I have found the balance between the two is a very thin line. The Sheraton staff walks it beautifully! If you have an opportunity to stay, I highly recommend the Bay tower with a bay view! My wife accompanied me on this trip and we thoroughly enjoyed having coffee on the balcony and watching the sailboats run in the bay. GORGEOUS!!! We have found that most hotels have hard bedding that makes for rough sleeping. Not the Sheraton. My wife and I found the bed to be surprisingly comfortable. The mattress was soft, with plenty of support. I can sum it up by stating: Stay here, you will not be disappointed!

<Content>This is a good hotel with nice and updated rooms, great view and good swimming pool. There are 2 major problems with this hotel. There's nothing you can do walking, so if you plan to drink some wine and have dinner in town you would have to take a cab. The 2 nd problem if you're driving are parking fees 22 for self parking and 28 for vallet. If you think you did a good deal, wait for the bill after you check out.

<Title>“Lovely stay, but be careful about room location.”
<Content>This hotel was chosen for me when I attended a conference in San Diego. It is very near the airport with a quick, free shuttle, and very courteous drivers both to and from the airport. I had to FedEx 2 important packages of conference materials to the hotel in advance. I was initially told that the package room closed at 4:30 PM, and since I was not arriving until late in the evening before the conference, I was worried about not being able to pick up the packages. I called ahead to make sure they would be available and Guest Services and the bellmen had everything waiting when I arrived. The hotel is located away from the main tourist areas and most restaurants, so you need a rental car or taxi (always available) to go most places. I tend to like the locations near the downtown or Convention Center, so there are places to walk to after my meetings. Lots of scenic places for jogging or walking near the water, though. There are 3 different locations for rooms within the same hotel property. The main tower attached to the lobby, the Bay Tower which is reached by a shuttle or a considerable walk, or the Lanai which is somewhat attached to the main hotel, but still a considerable walk. My room was in the Lanai and I was given a complex map to find it. I was offered the services of a bellman to help with my luggage, but had no idea how complicated it would be to find the room Not only that, but when I did find the Lanai, it was raining (unusual for San Diego) and all the rooms opened directly to the outside, the only elevator was miles away, and I trudged up the steps with all my luggage.to the top floor which was completely open to the rain. Every time I had to go to the Starbucks, restaurant, or free internet in the lobby, I was right out in the rain which lasted for 3 days. The room itself was fine, but I have no idea what the Tower rooms were like, very clean with comfortable beds and big desk. The TV had the 3 major networks and a few cable stations (limited). The view of the marina was beautiful. There was a very loud air conditioner in the wall of the room which you could turn either on or off, but not set a temp. so that it would go on or off. When you turn on the bathroom light, a loud fan automatically went on. So, all in all, it was loud. They have a rainfall shower, which some people like, and had a little bit harder setting, but it took forever to rinse out shampoo. Nonetheless, the hotel was very nice. Everyone was extremely courteous, and except for the check-in person who could have assigned a better location, very helpful with any request. I wound up ordering salads or sandwiches to take up to my room for several meals at Quinn's which is the bar and has a great menu. Their marinated skirt steak is delicious. I think the food all comes from a central kitchen, but did not try their main restaurant. The Starbuck's in the lobby is good, opens about 5:30 AM (I think) but closes at about 5:30 PM. The gift shop stays open until 11:00 PM, so no problem there. The Fitness Center is open with a key 24 hours and very well stocked with equipment. There are several beautiful pools and a large hot tub. There are 5 free computers in the lobby with a printer, but a charge to connect in your room.

<Title>“Was not as reserved, it was just, ok.”
<Content>We reserved our room at the Sheraton San Diego hotel, at the Marina address. This was the better of the two towers. When we gave the taxi driver the address and he took us to the Marina Tower, the bellman redireced us the the older, and being worked on tower. We found out later that there was a teachers convention in town and they had changed our reservation without our consent to the older tower. The old bait and switch routine. The pool was closed for renivation and the front of the Hotel was being painted and sand blasted. We thought we booked a 4 star hotel, I would rate the tower we stayed in a 2.5 star at best. We started to call price line and complain, but I don' t think this was Priceline's fault. We hold the Hotel responsible for changing our reservation to the lower price spread.

<Title>“Perfect Location”
<Content>I recently stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina with my Sister and some Family Members attending a wedding in the area. I never take the time to write reviews but this Hotel is worthy of my time. The location is great, just minutes from the Airport. I don't think you can get a bad view from your room. You either overlook the Marina or the Bay with commanding views of the city. I had to be pulled from my balcony each morning. The Staff could not have been more accomodating. If you are planning a trip to San Diego, this is the place to stay.

<Title>“Not a value for a money definitely”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel for about a week and I rate it as poor because of a service. I mean rooms are nice and clean, hotel has a pool and fitness center (I did not try those), butâ€¦I had number of issues with a service. Firstly you will be required to pay for every single service you get â€“ no free Internet (it costs almost 20$ a day! Crazy), no free breakfast and even I had to pay for my package handling! For a hotel that costs 200$ a day that is NOT acceptable. Also during a check out I had some objections on invoice I got. I was told that they will sort it out and let me know on email. Guess what â€“ they charged me anyway without giving any information! This is not a 5* hotel service. It is a money printing machine.

<Title>“The Service made this stay”
<Content>I stayed for a conference and over four days was treated professionally and warmly. Yes the bathrooms are small, and as the restuarants seemed to be served from a central kitchen, food was not as hot as it could be. BUT the staff is what makes this hotel worth it. And to those reading this, this is not just a "gushy, sentimental" review. I have worked hospitality and know what true value is. It's not always the size of the room but whether the staff is there for you when you need them. Thank you to: Anika @ check in who patiently helped me find a suitable room. Shane (shuttle driver) whose warmth has added to this hotel even in his first month there. Hayley and Brett whose kindess cannot be compared (you know what you did). Max (security) whose compassion and professionalism in a diffcult situation spoke volumes. and John (waiter at Harbour's Edge breakfast on the 21st) whose sunny disposition did alot to offset the cloudy weather. You all made my stay. Simone Brown (Toronto)

<Title>“Ignored!”
<Content>This hotel has ignored all of our attempts to contact them via telephone and email regarding the missing items from our room. The morning of our checkout I was packing the suitcases for our flight and noticed that our big shopping bag of clothes and souvenirs was missing. Nothing else was touched in the room and I quickly deduced that housekeeping could have picked it up thinking it was garbage. I immediately called the front desk in horror thinking it had gone to the dumpster and perhaps they could retrieve it before the inevitable. The front desk person was very defensive of the housekeeping staff and told me in a surly tone that this was a matter of security and that I shouldn't assume anything. Security came to the door and took all of our information citing they would begin an investigation and that they needed to review all the risk management strategies or something to that effect. I told them what I thought about it being a possible mistake by housekeeping given he fact that there was also packaging material from my now sobbing 8 year old son's souvenirs in the bag as well. I asked them to please go and check the garbage, but the gentleman just pursed his lips and gave me a blank expression that I could only deduce was that it "ain't gonna happen." They left the room and promised to call us and give us an update on the following Monday. After my phone calls (that magically go to voicemail) and email, it has been a month and there has been absolutely no response or contact. I am extremely disappointed with this lack of response. Shame on you Sheraton for such poor service (no service) after an emotionally upsetting violation of trust and promises. drsean Victoria BC

<Title>“We enjoyed our brief visit”
<Content>After an 8 hour travel day (3 hours to Houston, a 2 hour layover and a 3 hour flight to San Diego), we were pleased when we discovered that the hotel where we would stay one night was right across the street from the car rental, so we didn't have to worry about finding our hotel. It's a big place (over 1000 rooms) right on Harbor Bay Island. We were told upon check-in that they didn't have a room for us at that location but that we were set at the Sheraton Tower which was literally right around the corner, We drove there and were greeted in a most friendly manner. We found out, to our unhappy surprise, that self-parking was $22 per night and valet parking was $28 per night. The hotel lobby was quite nice and the woman at the front desk was efficient. She apologized for not being able to give us a room with a view of the bay side but that we would be on the marina side. We had our bags brought to our room and the bellboy was extremely helpful and friendly, giving us several suggestions of things to see and places to eat. We found the room quite large and comfortable with a nice view of the marina, which we didn't mind one bit. We had a comfortable night's sleep and a buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurant that we thought was very good but expensive. Checkout was easy. Overall, we had a pleasant visit and would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Title>“Pleasant hotel, good facilities but a bit of a hike from downtown...”
<Content>Some great aspects of this hotel, free computer and print facilities in the lobby, on site starbucks and a relaxed friendly atmoshere. As you would expect everything was nice and clean. As some of the other reviews say, this hotel is a bit out of town, we walked it a few times and it took approx 45 minutes to walk. Typically, we walked out for dinner downtown and got a taxi back to the hotel (approx $15). If there was a regular bus service available, i would have marked the hotel as a 4, as the location does limit your options. This would be fine if staying for a couple of days or only for a conference, but on holiday you want to get out and about as much as possible!

<Title>“I Never write reviews but I just have to say something”
<Content>I travel weekly for business and needless to say have been in hundreds of hotels but the sheraton on harbor island has some serious problems.... The gift shop is vertually never open, always a sign saying they will be back The lobby bar in the west tower has limited operating hours. Also it has 2 large screen tvs but durring my last three visits over the last 3 weeks it hasent had service. What is wrong with this place that they cant get there tvs up and runing to watch a ball game. The sugested 5 minute walk to the other tower to watch tv and have a beer is the last thing I want to do after traveling all day. The check in process is painful. waiting endlessly only to get a trainee...every time. Must not have good employee retention if they have such a steady flow of new desk agents. Finnaly...the shuttle! No where near as frequent as stated, I may just be really unlucky everytime I try to catch a shuttle but never less that 30 min from my experience. There are plenty of great hotels in sd, this isnt one of them. Ive had it and will have my secratary book rooms elsewhere .

<Title>“Pleasantly surprised”
<Content>We booked the Sheraton through Hotwire. After discovering our mystery hotel, we looked up the reviews on Trip Advisor, and had some concerns... However, I have to say we enjoyed our 3 night stay. + Our requested crib was delivered to our room before we arrived at the room. Granted, we checked in @ the Marina Tower and had to drive over... + Our toddler was able to watch airplanes and the SeaWorld fireworks show from her crib. This was definitely a unique experience. Our room faced north in the Bay Tower. The windows are floor to ceiling. + The pool has towels - it's in a big wooden box. + Close to the attractions we visited (SeaWorld, San Diego Zoo, Coronado) but you do need a car. It's next to the airport, and I didn't see any restaurants you can leisurely walk to. +/- In room internet is rather expensive, but there is free Wifi in the lobby. Also a big plus is that there is a guest PC for use in the lobby with a printer. - The check-in process was confusing... We parked and checked in @ the Mission Tower, which is the first Sheraton you see from the airport. We were re-directed to to the Bay Tower... had to repark. - Parking is expensive ($22/night)

<Title>“luv the sheraton san diego”
<Content>Stayed in both the marina and bay. loved the bay tower -Beautiful view of the bay-. Seafood chowder w/ glass of reisling at Bay Tower restaurant impeccable!Carlos @ the poolside bar @ the marina tower makes the best bloody marys ever!!!!Food there was fantastic. It's San Diego people, it's gonna be expensive, but the brunch @ the marina was superb and the hash browns I had w/ the eggs benedict off the regular menu were the best I've ever had. Even the snacks ordered from the poolside menu @ the Marina Tower were delicious and plentiful. You definitely get your moneys worth.Staff always gracious and accomodating. Liked it better than the W Hotel downtown. Thanks Sheraton for your outstanding performance. You helped to make our vacation Wonderful!!!! DH is a gold spg member but i would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to enjoy their San Diego experience.Location? we had a rental car which made it quite easy to get around sightseeing. It's pretty easy to find a good deal online.

<Title>“The service was 4 star and the view from our Marina Tower terrace was beautiful”
<Content>My husband,myself and fifteen year old son spent 3 nights and had a great stay. All the staff were very friendly and accomodating. The valet staff always gave us perfect directions, the desk staff and the restaurant/bar staff were also very attentive.The hotel is very clean and has just had a renovation. Rooms are very clean and housekeeping service was very conscientious.The pool is very relaxing and has a bar/resaturant outside. There was a good mix of family and business clientele. We stayed at Marina Tower because it was closer to restaurants/pool. The Bay tower has larger rooms but is a 5 min walk along the harbor and is quieter.The entire hotel has a resort feeling to it and is a very relaxing atmosphere. There are a lot of paths to take scenic walks/jogs around the Marina and Harboutr Island.Even though hotel is 5 min from airport we were never bothered by planes overhead. The hotel is a 10-15 min drive to Gaslight/Balboa Park and Zoo area. We were very happy that we stayed on Harbour Island instead of downtown San Diego hotel as we really felt like we were at a resort ans could still get into town easily. This is one of th the best values I have ever had at a hotel and would highly recommend it.

<Title>“Terrible location”
<Content>Went for a conference which was fine, but as far as doing anything else.... stay elsewhere. It's a taxi ride or bus ride to go anywhere interesting. There's nothing to eat there but barely adequate food from overpriced restaurants with surly staff. We took the hotel shuttle and 2 busses to get downtown and then took the train to get to old town... it just takes too long to get anywhere if you don't have your own vehicle. The hotel gets a "C+", the restaurants and location get an "F"

<Title>“Had a Great Time!”
<Content>Stayed here for two nights, on August 20-22. I booked it thru Priceline and I was a bit skeptical once I learned it was this hotel. It was probably my last choice. Thankfully, I had been reading reviews here on TripAdvisor. I called a few days beforehand to request that I be put into the Marina Tower. When we arrived at the airport, we waited for at least 35 minutes for the airport shuttle to arrive. (Even though when I called the hotel, they said it runs every 15-20 minutes. I donâ€™t know why it took so long, considering I could see the hotel from where we were standing. LOL! Finally, we board the shuttle and the guy tells us that weâ€™re staying in the Bay Tower. (Argghh!!) Iâ€™m scared at this point. Hahah! We get in line to check in and I ask if there was anyway to switch us over to the Marina Tower. The woman, whose name was â€œAnikaâ€� (I think) tells us that weâ€™re very lucky and says that sheâ€™s able to get us to the other tower, on the TOP floor. Score!!! She was very sweet and kind. Other than the airport shuttle running a little behind, I have no other complaints!! Iâ€™d gladly stay here again.

<Title>“Very very nice”
<Content>Stayed five nights and thought this was a great place (Bayside); enjoying the views of the water and airport. Very convenient to airport and only 10 minutes via cab to the downtown area (although we had a car and also traveled to other locations, with easy access to the freeway). The business center was good and internet generally reliable. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. As for the business meeting, the staff and service was outstanding (easy to eat too much because of the great quality and variety of choices).

<Title>“Wonderful!”
<Content>I spent two nights at the Bay Tower (purcheased through Priceline), Aug.20-22, and was pleasantly surprised! First, I must comment on the level of service all around. From front dest and room service to shuttle and valet, the Sheraton staff was wonderful! Kudos to everyone working Bay Tower that weekend! The hotel is conveniently located near the airport, and pretty close to downtown (about a $12.00 cab fare), yet the setting by the marina and bay give one the feeling of being in a private oasis. I had a sixth floor room with a view of the harbor (and airport) and despite the fact I could see planes taking off, it felt very peaceful. Saturday night I was even able to watch the fireworks at Seaworld from my (nice sized) balcony! The room itself was spacious, comfortable and very clean. The only negative remark I could make is that the size of the bathroom was a little small, not that of a four star hotel. Both mornings I used room service for breakfast and the meals were great, delivered timely and fresh. Coffee in the room is Starbucks and delicous and super easy to make. Directly across the street from the hotel is a walking path along the bay. It's lovely and is a great place to unwind and watch the boats and take in a terrific view of the San Diego skyline. I also walked over to the Marina building checked out the lobby, pool, grabbed an ice tea at the Starbucks and sat on a veranda there for a bit - very pleasant! I would absolutely stay at this property again and hope to return soon!

<Title>“Great Stay!!!!”
<Content>The hotel is very beautiful and the level of service is almost quite exceptional! From the doorman to the housekeepers to all the staff I interacted with, everyone of them was absolutely delightful and happy to serve us! Great Hotel, great pool, view is fantastic and location perfect! The bay is amazing! The only negative thing I would say is that the service at the pool could be better, the waiters and waitress are not on top of things! No one at the stand where you get your towels and can buy sun screen for more than 3 hours in a blue shy sunny day! 25 minutes to get a drink which never came so I had to go to the bar get it myself! The pool is great though. Other than that special area, everything was just fantastic!!!

<Title>“Good location, pricey parking, nice hotel bar, good pool, decent service.”
<Content>Reading the reviews here before going scared me a lot since we had booked a room for four days using priceline. The pickup from the airport was smooth and sure enough we were put in the bay tower which I had heard was worse than the marina tower. We had several air crew in the shuttle with us and they were directed to the marina tower so we felt a natural discrimination towards us the priceline customers. oh well. The bay tower was not bad surprisingly enough. It was a very pleasant less than 5 minute walk from the marina to the bay tower and our room was on the 10th floor with a nice view of the marina. Seriously, sitting outside on the balcony in the morning and drinking my coffee was a nice start to the day. We did not interact with the staff much other than to call them to get the times of the shuttle which they were always happy to give. This brings me to the transportation part of the review. Parking fees were 22 bucks a day! But this is easily discernible well in advance and anyone with a modicum of sense would do their research before going. We did a decent workaround - rented from hertz every day in the morning and returned in the evening. It cost us $10 more every day because of the $10 fee per rental but you are saving about $12 a day for the parking so in total a win. The shuttles from the hotel drop you to the airport and then you can take the car shuttle from there to the car lot. Summary: great location (everything in san diego we saw was close by), good transportation to the hotel, worth the money from priceline bid.

<Title>“Good Hotel but Hallways Stink”
<Content>The arrival experience was great and the parking guys did an awesome job (even during night and day). We were coming there to spend the weekend with the kids and go to Seaworld. The Hotel looks nice, has a business feel to it. Room service was good - the server again was very nice. It is apparent that these guys spend a lot of time on training on customer service as you can feel it all around the Hotel. My only issue was the smell in the hallway. We were in Room 1163, the hallway smelled like someone crapped on it. It may the old carpet and someone steaming it, but other than this minor item the stay was very pleasant and enjoyable.

<Title>“Amazing bay and marina views!”
<Content>We arrived at San Diego airport at 22:30 and I was concerned that checking-in at this time would be a problem, but it turned out to be a breeze at Sheraton. The hotel is a 5 minute taxi drive from the airport - perfect if you have an early flight to catch. My partner and I were greeted by very friendly staff who upgraded our room upon check-in. Our room was in the Bay Tower, which is only a scenic few minutes walk along the marina from the hotel's main building, the Marina Tower. We were on the eighth floor and had the most beautiful view of the bay. I'd consider going back for the view alone! We stayed for four nights. Unfortunately breakfast was not included in our rate and the room service menu in our room didn't exactly offer the most tempting prices, so we didn't experience any of the food on offer. We did however make the most of the Starbucks located in the Marina Tower - a great way to start the day. The main purpose of our trip was San Diego Comic Con. Regular free shuttle buses operated throughout the event, stopping outside both towers and taking us right up to the Convention Center. This hotel is perfect for anyone going to the convention who doesn't want to pay the high rates of the Gaslamp hotels, but also doesn't want getting there to be a hassle.

<Title>“Great Views of the Bay and the City”
<Content>At first I was disappointed to be so close to the airport and not within walking distance to downtown. However, it really is a lovely hotel (nautical theme throughout) and kind of away from the hustle and bustle. The views are incredible. A few restaurants are within walking distance which is convenient as well. This would get an even higher rating if they provided a shuttle to downtown!!

<Content>Had an awesome overnight stay! The rooms are spacious, staff is rushed but friendly and accommodating. I think most rooms have BEAUTFUL views of the marina plus balconies. Although it is near the airport, it does not feel that way at all. Location: Close to airport but only a 5 minute drive to downtown, not bad at all. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again when traveling back to San Diego. The executive management staff is SUPERB and very customer service oriented. Club rooms are special as they have additional amenities, however, the evening service is not around on Fridays...only for breakfast, which I found slightly odd. All in all, a very pleasant experience and worth getting a rez here!!

<Title>“Great unless you have a young family! Especially at Quin's restaurant.”
<Content>Had the worst experience at Quinnâ€™s restaurant in the Sharaton in San Diego Harbor last night. I asked the waitress if she could please have a table bussed so that my family could sit down. She said it would be several minutes and if I wanted to wait I could but did not know when it would be done. Since it was my first time in the restaurant and first time in the hotel I asked how I go about to reserve the table (put my name in the front, with her, etc.) and she said to stand by the table until she had the time to clear it off. The table by the way was a complete mess, not so much with the dishes from the previous guest, but with her towels, serving tray, and cleaner. She bussed the table and my family and I sat down. After we sat down a booth became available and my wife asked if I could get it for us since our 2 year old would be easier if he was between the two of us inside a booth. The waitress quickly came over to me and told me that table was reserved for another guest that had been waiting. As I was confused because she had told me that for me and my family to get a table we would have to stand by it, I asked her why she would hold another table for a guest and make me stand by a table. The other guest came to the table that had been told by the waitress that she would hold it and created a very uncomfortable situation for them and I. I went back to my table to let my wife know the bad news and when the waitress went by, I asked for clarification from the waitress. She said that they had been waiting for the table and I said I understood but why did she make me stand by a table while she took their name, she looked at me, looked at my kids, rolled her eyes, flipped her hair, and walked away. I never received clarification, an apology, or even acknowledgment, and she had someone else wait on us in her station area so she would not have to deal with us. It makes me wonder why a young family would receive different treatment as my money, tips, opinions, and access to the internet to voice it are just as good as anyone elseâ€™s. It took over an hour to get our food while people who came in after us were getting fed. When asked turned out that they were holding the kids food until my ribs were done, Honestly, with two small children starting to loose it from lack of food common sense says bring it out. The food was overpriced and the kids pizza was cold. The hotel charged us for items out of the mini bar fridge automatically because the left over pizza we put in the fridge blocked the sensor for an item. The line to check out was over an hour to clear up the bill. The view was great and if you did not have kids could be a very romantic place to stay, DO NOT STAY HERE WITH KIDS. THEY TREAT YOU AS IF YOU HAVE A DISEASE!

<Title>“Bay Tower - NOT a 4 star hotel”
<Content>I booked the Sheraton Harbor Island through Priceline for under $80 per night. Having read all of the negative reviews on here beforehand, I was very disappointed to find out we were booked into the Bay Tower, but thought I would give it a fair chance. The Bay Tower is, at most, a 1/4 mile away from the Marina Tower. Bay Tower has its own separate lobby. For all intensive purposes, they are 2 completely separate hotels that simply share the Sheraton name. For Priceline to allow the Bay Tower to be booked as a 4-star hotel is disappointing and frustrating. I'm sure there are different qualifications for what makes 4-star vs 3-star vs 2-star, etc. But for me, a 4-star hotel should make you think things like, "This is nice", or "This goes above & beyond a normal hotel", or basically, "Wow, this is fancy!" Sheraton Harbor Island Bay Tower sadly did none of those things. The Marina Tower, from what I saw, appeared to be a nice, newer, sleek-looking closer-to-4-star hotel. It's a 5-10 minute walk from the Bay Tower. The Starbucks in the Marina Tower is quite nice, and therefore very busy. If you choose the hotel's Green Option (of declining daily maid service), you will get a $5 coupon under your door each night, which can be used at Starbucks. So that was nice since it pretty much paid for a drink each morning. The living space in the room was average. Since it's literally across the street from the Bay, it had a nice balcony that looked out onto the Bay. The Bay-View has ships & military boats go by, vs. the Marina-View, which just has boats parked there. However, if you pick the Bay-View, there always seemed to be a lot of loading/unloading/work going on in the mornings since the loading docks are on the first floor, directly under the balconies. This causes a lot of noise (ie, not very relaxing), especially if you're on the lower floors Bay-view side. The room's decor itself was ok, nothing fancy at all. The couch looked quite worn. The bed was firm, bordering on hard. Pillows were very thin, even when double folded. The clock radio was cheap, as in $10 Radio Shack cheap. No iPod or auxiliary connection that I would expect a 4-star hotel to have. The bathroom really showed the age of the room. The wallpaper was borderline gross in places and should really be replaced straight away. The shower was weak in terms of pressure - it could not shoot to the back wall. But it did stay hot for a long shower. The towels were your basic white hotel standard-issue ones; i.e., the ones that are barely long enough to wrap around my 36-inch waist. I have nicer towels than this at home! And only one towel hook/hanger in the bathroom. The TV was pathetic. A 4-star hotel should not have an old 27" old CRT TV. This was the TV my brother had in high-school in the mid-90's. Also, our TV had an annoying habit, when the balcony doors were open, of switching itself back to the Hotel Menu channel randomly every couple minutes. The problem went away when the balcony doors were shut. Very odd. There is a $22 per night parking charge to park in the lot in front of the hotel. I wasn't that upset about the fee since most hotels - and everywhere else - in San Diego charge you for parking if you're anywhere near the water. I think it's fair to say that you really need a car if you're going to stay here for any extended period of time. Taxi charges will add up quickly. Because for the most part, you're really in the middle of nowhere in terms of shopping/places to walk to. There is a Fresh & Easy about 5+ miles away in Point Loma, but alas, there is no refrigerator in the room. On to the positives - the view obviously is great on the Bay side. The gym area downstairs was free to use. Again, dated machines but free is nice and unheard of at most hotels. The employees were all very nice and helpful. There is free wi-fi in the lobby. There is also a "business center" with 3 computers and a printer that are free to use. The room itself though feels outdated and not very professional at all for a "business center", but again, at least it was free to use. All in all, the Sheraton Bay Tower felt like a hotel from the Hotel Circle that had simply been placed in Harbor Island. It felt much more like a 2- or 3-star hotel. Nothing left me saying "Wow this is fancy". Even having paid a discounted rate, I still felt disappointed about the hotel experience. I would not stay there again.

<Title>“Didn't sleep well here”
<Content>We checked in and were put in a back building which is 3 stories tall. Were told it was a King bed but it was two doubles. A brief delay and visit to the front desk got us on the top floor (3rd) and a King bed. The air conditioner is motel style (not central) and is a unit near the sliding door. It is loud. L-O-U-D. I couldn't sleep at all the first night. Also this place is across the street from the San Diego International Air Port. You can hear every departure (they start early and so will you!). We had a view of the Lanai pool--seemed to be the place to make out. Kids enjoyed the other Lagoon pool and hot tub. Ping Pong tables are situated in the "Game room" which has two ping pong tables and a non-functional coin-operated pool table. It is very hard to enjoy this specific area because it is situated near a HVAC intake port which sounds, oddly, like a jet engine. So, if you are hard of hearing, stay here, it is a reasonble place with nice people working here, good service in the main restaurant and I enjoyed the waffles while my kids had plenty of choices in the buffet. Cost $50 for breakfast. The food and parking in all these touristy places is way overpriced so be prepared and get over it. I was happy with the valet service--very quick. We got this place on a hotwire rate of $100 per night, but looking back would have paid extra to have a quieter place. Bring earplugs just in case.

<Title>“The Missing Teddy Bear Comes Home”
<Content>What a wonderful stay. I wish we could have had more time to enjoy the hotel. My family which consists of my husband, two teenagers and a 10 yr old had a blast during the week of Comic-Con. Check-in was speedy and seamless. Check-out was just as well handled. We had found a discrepency on the bill and the counter check-out staff fixed it right away. We were given a spacious room for the 5 of us but one of the teenagers had to sleep on the floor anyway. The cleaning staff was gracious enough to make sure he had clean linen every day and we had plenty of coffee and towels for all of us. The best thing of all was getting my youngest childs Teddy Bear Back. Apparently the bear had been covered up in the bedding and inadvertently left behind. We didn't notice until we were several hours away. My child was beside himself. He said with huge allegator tears running down his face, "Mommy I need Henry. He keeps the bads dreams away". As you can probably guess I felt his absolute vulnerability and terror at that moment in time. The realization that for the first time in 9 yrs he would not have Henry to fall asleep with. I called the hotel and the security staff put housekeeping on the alert right away. We didn't hear anything for a day. I called the next day. Still no Henry but assurances were given that people were looking for the bear and someone would call me as soon as it was found. Day 2 we get a call. Henry had been located. Housekeeping had washed the bear and was waiting for a trip home. The next day the manager FedEx'd the missing companion to Oregon. We received Henry 3 days later. Clean and well travelled, into the very happy waiting arms of his life long companion. My son learned a valuable lession during those "Henry-less" days. #1 He could sleep nightmare free without Henry. #2 Never forget to look in the blankets at a hotel before declaring "I'm all packed lets go" and #3 It was sure good to get Henry home. Thank you to the unnamed manager that sent our Henry-The Teddy Bear Home.

<Title>“Motel?”
<Content>When I book a 4 star hotel and above I don't expect to stay in a motel... well at least that's what it felt like. My number one rule is.. I cannot drive up to my front door. Well it was exactly that! I'm checking in thinking when they gave me room #5*** I'm getting a room on the 5th floor or something...NO! I had to drive around to the back to some rooms that were attached to the hotel that looked like it was an old run down motel. The room was so musty and icky and when I complained they said that's all they had. We got there after driving in from Anaheim and spending a day at the zoo and was just too exhausted to find another hotel. And are you serious... $22/day to park your own car too? Sheraton, you have disappointed me!

<Title>“Hotel fine once there. Reservation process sucked”
<Content>We traveled to stay at this hotel as part of a baseball tournament where this hotel was one of the host hotels and we were required to stay there. Once there, the hotel was fairly decent except for the "car alarms" that go off on a nightly basis. Not sure why that is but, we suspect the proximity of the naval base? Nobody's gps's worked properly in the area either which we were certain were a result of the naval base. If staying here again, I would highly recommend the Marina Tower over the Bay Tower. Bay's nice but, Marina's where it's all happening. Restaurant prices were horrible forcing most to find food elsewhere........AND, the Bay tower could really use some laundry facilities.....especially if their going to be the host hotel for a baseball tourney. The worst part of the entire trip was the entire reservation process where the resey's were made back in March and apparently this hotel/chain is not set up for this type of venue as our resey's were a complete nightmare from the beginning. The hotel staff once we arrived was very accomodating to insure everything was in order and we got everything fixed. Kudo's to Blair & Brett for all of their help and excellent professionalism however, BP a supervisor back at the main office (you know who you are), NEVER fulfilled his promises nor even replied back to repeated emails asking for help. This after spending a fair amount of time on the phone with him to rectify everything. Give that guy a demerit...........The hotel itself is in a great location with a great view of the harbor. They should really step up to Queen beds (in lieu of doubles) cause you have the room to do so and doubles are rediculous for couples traveling with kids or players. We especially liked the overall locale of the hotel and it's proximity to many of the featured area's: Sea World, Zoo, Old Town, Little Italy, Coronado Island, etc....... And it's a HUGE SECRET that I'll share with you here.......Between the two towers and closest building to the Bay Tower, there's a MARINA DELI on the back side of the building that serves wonderful bfst & lunch for extremely reasonable prices. They also have quite a few ammenities should you need drinks, snacks, beer whateover. Too bad we did not find it till the last day we were there but, a fantastic breakfast was had by almost our entire team and priced as it should be. There's also laundry facilities there but, do not believe they are suppose to be available to anyone aside from the members of the marina........but, it's there and nobody is spose to talk about it. Just this little fact will enlighten your experience immensely while staying at this portion of the hotel. Would I stay there again? YES, with a much greater knowledge than the 1st time. Enjoy.........(would I try to get resey's every fixed again with BP...................NO!)

<Title>“Disappointed”
<Content>I was very disappointed by the poor service. It seemed like they did not have enough staff to start with check in. At times there were long lines and 3 people working. Check in seemed to take much longer then other hotels I have stayed at like Marriott. Now I realize my disappointed, use to staying those hotels, this was a differt culture. I did not feel like the staff really care about the happiness of the customer. I was use to being able to check in early with out a problem and not being charged $10.00 per hour for late check. Check in was 3pm. My room was not available until 4:30. I was offered accomdations for my bags until a room was ready, but felt like this was not something new.

<Title>“Hotel was near perfect for us”
<Content>Booked the hotel through Priceline for $104 and was then prepared to be very disappointed after reading all the negative reviews here. However, the hotel far exceeded expectations. Despite what another poster mentioned, I thought it was a perfect hotel for a family with young children. The location was quiet and serene, there were many amenities at the Marina Tower, they even had movie night at the pool one evening. The front desk associate was extremely helpful. She helped to get us into a double/double instead of the king we had been booked into and she even moved us from the Bay Tower to Marina and to the 12th floor! Thanks so much for your effort Samantha. The only complaints we had are 1.) Yes, the parking is extremely overpriced at $22. 2.) The large pool at the Marina Tower was closed an entire day for "Servicing". The smaller pool was open though. Seemed odd since I recall other reviews in previous months stating the same issue. I wonder if it's not really a servicing issue, but that they just don't want two pools open at the same time on a weekday since they would have to staff them both.

<Title>“This was the worst and most expensive hotel stay in memory.”
<Content>San Diego in July. Crowded, crowded, foggy and cold. We booked a room for our last night in town as we had a 6:30 a.m. flight. We asked for an early check-in. Got there at 12:15 and were not allowed in our room until 4:20 p.m. The front desk staff was rude. The room was incredibly expensive and our card was charged $50 more than we were quoted over the phone. All in all, our stay there cost $400 (after I complained and got the $50 taken off our bill) for 16 hours of time, only 12 hours of which were in the room. Oh yeah and they flunked wake up call too. Fortunately we woke ourselves up and made the plane. Total rip off!!!

<Title>“Very Nice, Clean, Bad Parking”
<Content>Got a special rate through USTSA. Marina Tower was very nice, clean. It smelled brand new. Rooms were very quiet; didn't hear noise from neighbors only airplanes as it is very near airport. Beds were very comfortable. Parking was very inconvenient at $22/day ($25 if you get valet). We had to park far away in a dirt lot. It is kind of out of the way from stores, and restaurants. It was excellent quality for the discounted $114/night we paid.

<Title>“Not recommended for families”
<Content>We had a 3 year old and 6 month old with us. In the last 3 years traveling all over the world with a kid, I've never stayed at a SPG hotel where they flat out refuse to provide a complementary mini-fridge to store critical baby items. This one was it; after turning us down, the service/front desk refused to ever pick up our phone calls again for the entire 3 night stay. They did eventually relent after my wife drop by the front desk for the n^th time asking and looking for buckets/bags/trash cans/etc to hold enough ice as an alternative. As a comparison, the staff our hotel in Hawaii in May practically begged us to let them store our stuff in their kitchen fridges until they can move in a fridge an hour later. After staying at the Sheraton in San Deigo, we went to the Sheraton Park in Anaheim; upon being told that the mini-fridge did not have freezer compartment for us to refreeze our ice-packs, the service staff rushed a new one in within 10 minutes. Perhaps the San Diego Sheraton is more business oriented? Anyway, I would not recommend this hotel at all for families with babies/toddlers. On to other aspects: Overall, the room itself in the Bay Tower was bigger than most non-suite rooms in any hotels we've ever stayed in. However, the bathroom was abysmally smalled. They could have shaved much off the living space to make the bath bigger - the room itself would still have felt bigger than rooms in other hotels. As others have noted, the restaurants are in the Marina tower, not Bay. We took one look at the menu of the one dining option in the Bay and decided to eat at the Gaslamp area instead for each of our meals. I did receive an incredible deal on the rooms through my corporate account, so I don't have much to complain. If I were to pay the "lowest" $299 prices from the various traveling sites for the days we were there, I'd be extremely happy after the experience.

<Title>“Great location for Seaworld and the Zoo”
<Content>Stayed here for 3 nights. Paid $74 a night plus taxes on priceline. Hotel is located on Harbour Island near to the airport. Didn't really notice the noise at all. There are two parts to this hotel, the Marina Tower and Bay Tower. Make sure you stay in the Marina Tower as this is main part of the hotel. We got an excellent view of the Marina. The hotel pool is really nice and there is also a nice walk along the Marina. Seaworld and the Zoo are within a 15 minute to the hotel. My only gripes would be the cost of parking which was 25 dollars and the long check in that we had. The room is really nice and modern, however the bathroom was really small. The hotel is not within walking distance of Downtown and you need a car to get around! Overall if you can get a good deal I would thoroughly recommend it.

<Title>“Good Solid Hotel. Spotless. Attentive even during a conference of 800!”
<Content>We experienced no difficulties or hassles when checking in. There was a conference during our entire stay which did not prove to be anything more than a delayed wait at the elevators in the early morning. Pool was clean and staff was very attentive- thanks Stephanie! Beds were comfortable and rooms were spotless (and I'm an Italian wife-clean freak type) . Been to San Diego three times and this hotel met all of our needs (Starbucks too!) Will return!

<Title>“Great Hotel - Comfiest beds ever”
<Content>trip advisor was such a great help to me that I just had to write a review. The beds are so soft that I wanted to take it home with me. Many people said that and they were right. The view from the Bay Tower is amazing but realize that the Marina Tower (which is short walk from the Bay Tower) has all the ammenities i.e. Restaurant (very over priced of course - Quinns - but they have great burgers), Starbucks, lagoon-like pool. For us it was perfect to go next door for all of that and tip toe back to our quiet lovely view. Staff was very nice and the rooms are big and very clean. Do yourself a solid and give it a try. P.S. We went for Comic Con and it was a very short shuttle trip - good stuff.

<Title>“I will not stay at this hotel again! Unfriendly Staff and Stressful Stay”
<Content>Staff was unfriendly - I was just another transaction. I asked for a quiet room and I was put in a room near a large family with kids that fought and kicked the walls late into the night. The adults were just as loud. It didn't help that the walls were paper thin. Calling the front desk yielded no results. I had to confront the noisy neighbors myself at 11pm which resulted in stress and lack of sleep. Calling the front desk was another issue. They would not answer the phone. I asked the front desk for a flower vase, they told me they would bring one up. They never did. Upon checkout, the front desk did not thank me or ask me if I had a nice stay at the hotel. They took my credit card, gave me the reciept, and I left.

<Title>“Bay Tower - Staff could not care less...”
<Content>I reserved two rooms for a 3 night stay at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. Our party was relegated to the Bay Tower, which was an older building, sadly in need of a face-lift. Very disappointing in appearance, cleanliness and amenities. What was truly surprising was the "couldn't care less" attitude shown by the staff. We would have to call the front desk numerous times to get even the most basic things [eg. previous occupant had left the room safe locked]. The gift shop was open for only a few hours over the entirety of our stay, which was unfortunate given that the hotel is isolated from any stores. The business centre's printer didn't work, which staff knew about but didn't bother to post a sign, or even tell any of the guests who were attempting to use the equipment. I run a health care service organization and it is abundantly clear that there is a lack of oversight on the part of management. A very poor effort on the part of Sheraton.

<Title>“Customer service is fabulous.”
<Content>We got a really good deal during our stay so we didn't pay the usual crazy resort price (thank you Hotwire). I have my hang ups with the roads in San Diego so finding this place wasn't the easiest thing but upon arrival I felt comfortable. We stayed in the Bay Tower, which I admit must not be as great as the main hotel, but for the price we paid, we didn't mind. This hotel is not really in a good location. It's right across from the airport, noise wasn't a problem but still, really? It's also not close to any restaurants or shops. We had to drive out for dinner and San Diego road's are not my favorite. But service was fabulous. The staff is excellent, quick, and friendly. They give really good advice about the area and the hotel amenities.

<Title>“Tale of Two Hotels, One Reservation and a $400 per night bill for a run down property.”
<Content>As an SPG fan, this was disappointing. Firstly, they have two properties. One is a hotel, which they call the 'Marina Tower' with nice lobby, flat tvs and restaurant, etc and then they have another called 'Bay Tower' which is more like a run down apartment building/crackhouse/dorm that they like to shuttle you to and call it 'an upgrade' and that they 'have bigger rooms' and so on. Liars. It is horrible, run down, CRT TVs and cream whitewashed furniture. The other tower has Flat TVs, lovely showers and you are on the Marina, not overlooking the Airport, which is the Bay Tower view. Add this to the fact that it is $300+ per night, charge $25 per night for self parking your car, $13 per PC for internet per night and this is a $400+ per night stay and honestly, a joke. Even sitting in the restaurant for breakfast and all you see is stains on the windows that block your view of the harbor and make you ask yourself what else in this hotel isn't clean. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else when you are in San Diego. This hotel is overpriced (with internet and parking it was $400+ per on a weekend) for the quality and they bait and switch. None of which are qualities that I will patron and I will never, ever stay here again. This has tarnished my opinion of this brand. It should not be a Sheraton, but perhaps a Four Points.

<Title>“Nice stay - little expensive”
<Content>Me and a friend stayed there for 2 nights. The hotel is very close to the airport, so the free shuttle from and to the airport was a plus. There is only one receptionist, so we sometimes saw people making lines waiting to be attended. When we got there they told us that the room we had reserved was not ready, but he found another one with two beds instead of one for the same price. People in general were very friendly and they have all handy tips and flyers about the city and attractions. We did not have a car so going in the free shuttle was a good way for saving money. The room was very clean and we had daily room service, there is no refrigerator just a mini bar with very expensive candybars. The swimming pool at the bay tower was parcially small compared to the one at the marina tower. View from room was great even at night.

<Title>“Disappointing at best.”
<Content>We arrived at the hotel our room wasn't ready and it was 2 hours past the projected check in time when we finally got to our room. The front desk staff had a line several deep and only one person at the desk. She was extremely pleasant and did her best to service everyone. The phones were ringing off the hook and she was trying to focus on each customer, management should really consider getting more help during peak times checking in and out. Our room was dissappointing at best, the view was great, we were on the harbor side, this however was the only highlight of our room. We went out to enjoy the balcony and had only one chair. We called twice before someone arrived with a chair, it was dirty and we had to clean it before we could use it. Our room had several non working outlets. Traveling with 2 other young woman all with cell phones, laptops and other electronics to charge, this was a huge problem in our room. I called twice before an Engineer came to our room, he said he had to get a tool, left and never returned. At that point we gave up. You have to question the decision not to offer wireless internet. For a hotel not to offer free Wi-Fi or at least offer it as an amenity for a fee is sad. This was a business trip and it made it very difficult to work as well as my 2 travel partners. The wire service was for one computer only and a huge inconvenience to be trapped at the desk. The beds were comfortable and very clean. The housekeeping staff on the 4th floor were very pleasant and worked hard to service the rooms. We love San Diego and will be back but not at this hotel.

<Title>“Absolute Bliss”
<Content>Everything was great! The Bay towers view was beautiful and peaceful. The bed and pillows were unbelievably comfortable... so comfortable my boyfriend and I ordered room service so we can could stay in bed a little longer and eat out on the balcony. We were also surprised by a $50 credit to use for food or beverages. Absolutely No complaints about our trip.

<Title>“Slightly disheartened”
<Content>The room was nice, the bed was comfortable and the view was beautiful. I was however, disappointed that there was no refridgerator in the room except the extremely expensive mini bar filled with candybars. I have a 2 year old and had to turn the mini bar around to keep him out of it. Also, I did not appreciate having to pay $22.00 a day for the priviledge of parking my vehicle there. I never saw anything in the advertising advising me of this fee when I was searching for a hotel in San Diego.

<Title>“Location, Location, Location!”
<Content>I usually am accustomed to staying at the W Hotel or Westin hotels but this time I wanted to close to Sea World and since I've stayed here before I thought I'd try this hotel again with my young children. I have to say I was happy that I got automatically upgraded to the 9th floor since I'm an SPG Gold Cardmember because we got the downtown SD view with the bridge in the background. Beautiful! I was happy with the SPACIOUS room that we got with the king size bed. I love the extra seating blocks and couch! Great size for a standard (or maybe deluxe?) room! I took my girls (ages 5 and 3) to the other pool since it was bigger but I was very disappointed with the lack of pool service. I had to go up to the bar to order and then flag the waitress down to check out. She redeemed herself since she caught a mistake on the bill and discounted the beer I had since it was happy hour. We went back to the bay tower pool and soaked in the jacuzzi at sunset but the emergency switch kept beeping and beeping...we had to leave. Then, we literally walked 500 feet to the waterfront and watched the sunset cast its color on downtown SD....beautiful! Great location...especially if you like to take long walks with beautiful views! All in all, it was a nice hotel experience with the front desk, valet, and housekeeping service.

<Content>Overall my stay at the hotel was very good, however, any attempts for shopping, dinner or any other activities through the concierge was dismal at best. I received better service from the valets and the shuttle drivers on activities that should have been handled by the concierge.

<Title>“Kudos to the Sheraton on the Marina”
<Content>I had a wonderful stay last week at your hotel. From the entrance with the sweeet aroma to the staff at the front desk to the housekeeper on the 6th floor. My stay was great. I would like to mention Keri & Brett at the desk, Victor and the Chef in the restuarant with the buffet style set up. I can not forget Estella B. and Natalie M., in the begining Ashley Eng helped with the arrangements long distance in planning, coordination and implementiing everything we could think we needed. The special touch was the fruit basket I received in my room from Natalie and Estella, that was the icing on the cake. The bedding was so very comfortable every night, I recommend that everyone mention receives a raise or day off for a job well done. Sincerely, Major Mary Brookins United States Air Force Nurse Corp

<Title>“Never again!!!”
<Content>I am so not happy with this hotel. The first time I stayed there it was perfect! The second it was awful! I stayed here for a wedding for two nights and might I mention I was the make-up artist for this wedding as well as the bride's brothers girlfriend. Everything was beyond screwd up. They put us all in the different towers and when I checked in I had them fix that and put us all in the same room. It also took 40 min to check in. And then they stuck me in a room with no A/C. Might I mention I live in San Diego and i was only staying here for the ease of getting the bridal party ready. So I was stuck sleeping in 80 degree heat! When I called they said in the morning they would fix the room since they were booked and could not switch me rooms. In the morning they came in and decided to start fixing it at 9am and when I told them at 10am I would have the bridal party coming in and needed the A/C fixed. They told me it would take longer and we would be without A/C. So finally they switched me rooms. And Frita the person in charge didn't even want to comp the night stay let alone give me a discount on the room. So finally they changed me rooms. I had to go down for the keys and I had to move my own luggage since the bell hop never made it up with my keys or to move my stuff. I will not recommend this hotel to anyone!!! Please dont stay here let alone block rooms for an event.

<Title>“A nice stay on the marina”
<Content>I was a wee bit nervous about my three night stay at the Sheraton Marina, based on some other reviews. At check-in, the woman behind the desk gave me keys to a room in the tower, which she said had two double beds. When I told her I had requested a king, she switched me to another room in the lanai section on the ground floor. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. There was a patio with sliding glass door that faced the tennis courts. The TV was a large flat-screen. The shower had one of those fab shower heads with a million little jets (and great water pressure). Oh, and the bed was super comfy. Housekeeping was great. The bed was made every day, and any towels that were left on the floor were replaced with fresh ones. While it is true that the hotel will award a $5 gift card to use on the premises for every night the housekeeping services are denied, it is by no means a requirement to accept this offer. Normally, I avoid eating in (chain) hotels like the plague. Usually the offerings are lame and overpriced. We ended up having a late dinner one night in the hotel bar, and it was actually just as good as if we had gone out somewhere, and not super expensive. There were some surprisingly decent beer selections, as well. The main reason for my stay was because of work, and I was a little skeptical when I saw that the exhibit room was actually a giant white tent outside the hotel. It was a little strange, but certainly better than the dungeon-like, subterranean exhibit areas of other hotels. Equally important, the boxed lunches were way above average, and the deli-style lunch on the last day of the exhibits was pretty tasty. With all these great things, I will say that there was a lack of customer service in some areas. I tried getting in touch with someone â€“ anyone â€“ about a shipment that was being held for me, and I had to call practically every number just to get someone to finally answer a phone (thank you, concierge-lady). Same thing when I called to make the reservation prior to the trip. I donâ€™t know if they are short-staffed or what, but not being able to get in touch with the front-of-house is annoying. Those minor inconveniences aside, I was still very pleased with the hotel overall and wouldnâ€™t think twice about returning. (Donâ€™t forget to say hi to the cute fish in the giant tank in the lobby!)

<Content>We have stayed here with our dog 5 straight summers. The headline says it all. 113 in Scottsdale, 70 in SD. We love the Bay tower marina side views, sunrise and sunset off the corner of the room's balcony, just a little direct sunlight at each end of day on the balcony, but sunny view on marina and water all day, simply idyllic. Great, inexpensive restaurants nearby, like Point Loma Seafoods, Pomodoro. Great workout facility. We'll be coming back every summer.

<Title>“There are plenty of other hotels by the sea”
<Content>When I checked in, I was surprised to learn the hotel charges $22/night for parking. This charge was not clearly disclosed prior to check-in and comes across to me as tacky. On the third night of my stay, I came back to my room to find my keycard did not work. I headed down to the lobby and learned the hotel staff had mis-booked our stay and believed we had checked out that day. The staff member who assisted us seemed friendly enough, and assured us that the problem had been taken care of. Yet the very next morning the hotel folio had been slipped under the door and showed us checking out that day! I'm tolerant of one such mistake, but after an issue has been brought to the staff's attention and the same mistake is made the following day, I made the decision to never return to this hotel. To top it off, since the hotel staff messed up our check out date, we did not receive housekeeping during part of our stay. All in all, it was a disappointing experience.

The weather was simply perfect, in the 60s, coming from an almost 100 degree environment. The hotel was clean, the food was good, and I enjoyed the vouchers too. Thanks for good customer service, way to go! Hope to be back. JA

<Content>I stayed in the west tower of the Sheraton Marina San Diego for three days. Very attractive and clean room. The front desk is really helpful, the staff always try to help you! The view of the sea is incredible! Be sure to book a bay, not marina, view in the west tower (the east tower has not been renovated to my knowledge). Nice complementary appetizers for happy hour in the lounge where is available a free internet desk!

<Title>“Other than weather enjoyed San Diego”
<Content>My only complaint would be when I checked in I was advised that I had booked a room with a king size bed (not the double I thought I had). I wasn't going to let that bother me; besides checking in on July 4th before the fireworks > well I was in a hurry to see the amazing show. Now that I'm home and reviewed my confirmation I did indeed book the double > given that I have confirmation of same you would think the front desk would also and not make it like its my mistake if thats all they had left; the hotel was packed due to the long weekend. I found the hotel very clean and other than the minor mix up with the front desk (seems to be a problem with this hotel given the other comments) I enjoyed my week. The weather was totally unexpected; but not Sheratons fault. I met some friendly locals who were as surprized by the cold weather as I. I loved the location near the airport. Also had a great view of the Navy base. If back in San Diego I'd stay here again; but bring my confirmation in order to avoid check in mix ups.

<Title>“Very Pleasant”
<Content>Check in was a bit slow, but not really an issue, we had to remind them that we had Club room access as they forgot which would have meant we couldnt access the Club Lounge, but we got that sorted so was ok. The room was quite small compared to all the other hotels we had stayed at in the US on our holiday, in saying that though the decor was very nice, the room was clean the bed was very comfy and the view was great. One issue which was not the hotels fault really but would have liked some kind of announcement to have been made, after checking in we experience a 5.4 earthquake, was in our room sitting on the bed this was very scary to me as we dont experience these hardly at all where we live, as I said not the hotels fault but a phone call or some sort of PA annoucement would have be been good. Walked down 12 flights to the lobby, as lifts automatically shut down which is expected and the lobby was caotic, quite alot of flustered guests and not really any hotel staff around. Apart from that was a pleasant stay.

<Content>The room was pretty clean except for a few long black hairs in the bathroom which shouldn't be there for a hotel of this level. The location is isolated from entertainment. It is located right on the marina which is very nice. If you want to go anywhere it's gonna run 10 dollars minimum for a taxi to grab a bite to eat. Also, you'll pay $12 a day for internet in your room. And $12 if you take a drink from the minibar.

<Title>“The Bay Tower is not where you want to be for a conference”
<Content>We were in town for a conference and were put in the Bay Tower when we made our reservation as if it would be a good thing. While I am sure the Marina Tower was 4 star the Bay Tower was lacking in the amenities. The pool bartender Anthony whined and complained that he had to work when the sun finally came out. He told us our beers were $4 each but when he took the money inside for change he kept a $4 tip for himself. The bar should have been able to take cash. The one restaraunt had very limited hours. The shuttle buses were very slow between buildings and on the day we presented this made things difficult getting equipment back and forth. The view over the Marina was lovely but I would have rather had the convenience of being in the main building for our conference. The food at the conference was really done well. After putting many of us in the baytower they should have made a morning coffee cart available to us in the lobby so we could get some while we waited for the shuttle. I would only recommend this if you were in the Marina Tower.

<Title>“Rediscover?....recommend Rethink before deciding to stay here”
<Content>Every aspect of the hotel was a disappointment. Hotel is across from the airport and convenient but so is the Hilton. This property was remodeled but is poorly ran and highly inefficient. I waited nearly a half an hour to check In and was only sixth in line. Upon arrival, there was no one at the front desk and after ten minutes, someone came from the back room and after that, another one for spg guests. The spg gold/platinum person was so slow that the regular person was averaging 5:1 over the spg gold person. As a platinum, I gave up and joined the regular line. After you get the keys and a parking pAss to pay 22 dollars to park in a dirt lot, I was left to my own to find the elevators. There are many elevators and most likely, you will end up o. The wrong elevator like I did. I guess this is how they greet guests or show them the workout room by lugging their luggage in a quest for the room. I have stayed at every star wood property in San Diego and this is by far the worst. They even give you one less in room coffee pack than all of the other Sheraton properties. The rooms are nice with warm rooms nut a lot of hall noise and is not quiet. Also, if you are friendly like me, prepare yourself to be ignored when greeting hotel employees with a friendly hello...I greeted two folks and neither responded. I don't think this property is very kid friendly although they have A pool. To my platinum colleagues, the only amenity the property offers is points so do not expect anything else. This has to be my 45th starwood stay this year and by far the worst...so no need to rediscover or even return.

<Title>“Expected more for 4-star hotel”
<Content>I'll begin by saying all of the gentlemen outside the hotel were very nice and welcoming. The bellman was readily available and the valet employees always came out to open my door when returning from a cab ride. Outside their doors, they provide a great 4-star experience. The service inside; however was not as pleasant. The check-in wait time was very long and there was only 1 person at the desk for the majority of the time during my 5 day stay. This was very inconvenient and time consuming for anything I needed that required assistance from the front desk staff. I tried several times calling the front desk from my room and never got an answer. Room service took forever and I never received fresh towels for my room. I paid the extra $50/night for a Club Room which should provide "upgraded amenities" such as a one of the top to floors with "breathtaking views of the city", terry bathrobe, bathroom magnifying mirror, access to the club lounge, etc. No robe or magnifying mirror and the club lounge could only be accessed from 1 set of elevators on the opposite side of the hotel from my room (which wasn't on one of the top 2 floors). Of course I figured this out after 25 minutes of searching because no one answered the phone at the front desk. I could go on but those were my biggest issues with the hotel. I would never stay at this hotel again.

<Title>“Enough with the texting!”
<Content>We just finished our stay at the Sheraton and we were very pleased with the hotel and service. Our only complaint was that the pool attendants spent more time texting than playing with the kids. The two helpers called the kids over to play a golf game that took about 4 minutes and then the helpers sat back down. I asked if the helpers were going to play a game with the kids and they said in about an hour they would maybe play another game. It would have been nice if the helpers could have played tag... with the kids.We have stayed at several beach hotels that have been kid friendly and fun for the kids. Sheraton didn't go the distance and the kids have asked not to return to this hotel. They said it was boring and there was nothing to do. I do not recommend this hotel if you have kids.

Ideal position for travelling about (and also watching San Diego Bay fireworks!). Pity Sheraton couldn't do anything about the weather (colder than Scotland!) Would thoroughly recommend the hotel and its facilities and would visit again if in California.

<Title>“Not Happy With the Management”
<Content>Check in took over 30 Min. We checked in on Friday before the 4th of July holiday weekend. You would think they would have more than one person checking in, but she was very nice and did apologize for the wait. The room was great with a wonderful view. 4th of July fire works were amazing! We stayed three nights and never had any hot water. Other than that we enjoyed the room (bay tower 4th floor) . Checking out-not so great! The rate we were quoted when booking the room was some how changed to $50 more a night. The manager on duty did NOTHING to change my rate and said that's what it is and offered a print out of the rate SHE has. After checking out I spent 45 min on the phone with cental reservation, who were the ones I booked my stay with. Come to find out when I called to confirm my room and rate 4 days before some how the rate was changed. I was told to call the mgr and they will fix it. I called to speak with the same mgr I spoke with when I checked out and she said sorry it's still $50 more a night and I must have changed something when I called to confirm. Hummm...wouldnt I know that? And no, I didn't change anything. She said she couldn't help me and would have to speak with her mgr and would return my call the next day. Mind you all of this is still being done on my vacation. Back at home the next day, I still haven't heard anything. I call the same mgr at the hotel and asked her why I haven't heard back from her. She said she will go ahead and correct the bill since she doesn't want to go "round and round" with me. Pretty shady considering she told me she couldn't make any changes the day before. Hopefullly when the bill comes in it will have the correct rate quoted charged. If it wasn't for the rate issue and the way the management handled it poorly, I would have gone back.

<Content>I had booked a room on the San Diego Zoo website the morning of our stay but when I arrived at check-in the staff could not find my reservation. However, they solved the problem immediately and upgrade our room to one with "a view". The room was very nice, clean and comfy. I really enjoyed the balcony looking out on the marina bay! The staff was helpful with all types of questions about various sightseeing locations. Upon check out they did say I would be charged for the parking which should have already been prepaid but upon checking my bank statement when I arrived home, everything had worked out in the end. Thanks for a wonderful stay and I will definitely checkout more Sheraton locations during future travels.

<Title>“Plastic in the food & Bed Bugs!”
<Content>What was supposed to be a fun family vacation mixed in with some work turned out to be a hue disappointment. When I booked the room I was presented with photos and reviews of all the outstanding renovations. When we arrived we were quickly told we would be a the â€œotherâ€� tower. The bayside tower was not what we had seen or booked. Not wanting to make a big deal about it we checked in. It took 25 minutes before the desk answered my call to bring up our luggage. By that time my husband had self parked our car, gotten a coffee and made his way back to our room only to have to turn around and go get our luggage himself. We went to meet my sister in law who we were traveling with who was in the Marina Tower for dinner. We went to Quinns as the other restaurant was not open?? In our order of fish and chips we were served a piece of deep fried plastic that was still attached to the fish. My husband nearly choked on it thinking it was a bone! Our waitress did her best but she was missing in action most of our meal. When the Manager did come over he offered to comp the dish. Unfortunately, not wanting to make a scene in front or our 2 small children we said okay. Needless to say, the meal was ruined for everyone and no one finished their meals. $90.00 for food no one could eat and service that was unacceptable. We went back to our hotel and the next morning my husband woke up with a huge bug bite on his leg, when we pulled back the sheets on the bed bugs flew out. We were able to catch one to show to the Operations Manager and bug guy. My husband still has the bite on his leg and itâ€™s been over a week we have been home. We were moved to the Main Tower and upgraded to a mini suite with $100 Sheraton money but we were paying $300 a night to get fed plastic and to get bit by bed bugs!!! Unacceptable. I would not and will not recommend your hotel to personal or business travelers.

<Content>I experienced the worst treatment from management and housekeeping..... It took management 35 minutes at check-out to come to try to address the issues. I still had to call the corporate office to get the issue resolved.... almost missing my flight in the process.. find a different hotel!

<Title>“Bay tower property just OK. Monitor your bill carefully for over charges”
<Content>My stay at this property did not get off to a great start. At check-in upon hearing I booked the room through a third party, E.G. Expedia, Priceline, Hotwire, I was told I would be in the Bay tower and not the main Marina tower. They claim it one property but it is two. Dont be fooled by the web site as the amenities at the bay tower are poor. Pool tiny, fitness center a joke (a couple of cardio machines and some dumbells). The main marina tower has 2 pools and a proper fitness center. It has the nice restaurants and the Starbucks. The main tower offers movies by the pool at night (Weekends) and has other fun daily pool activities. Bay tower nothing. You feel like a second class citizen and not worthy of the Sheraton name. The one redeeming quality of both properties is the view. Rooms are average sized at best but was clean and oder free. Bathroom was small and the toilet was loud and sounded like a cruise ship toilet and toilets flushing can be heard through out your stay. Balcony was nice with a view of the bay. Beds and pillows were comfy. On my last night they slipped my statement and it said everything was paid in full and was Charged $288. As my room was pre paid I was not too happy with what I saw. I went to reception and they corrected the problem. Just beware every person ahead of me had a problem with over charging. From a 70 year old man being charged for the entire contents of his mini bar (apparently he bumped into it) to another person being charged for an extra day. I would only recommend this place because of the location but thats it. Finally please keep in mind this review is based on my stay in the bay tower. I might have had a better time at the main property.

<Title>“Club benefits a joke-10 people in line for breakfast & staff clears buffet”
<Content>This was the worst Starwood Preferred Guest experience I have had. The designated reception counter was cold and uninterested in being helpful. I was traveling with my son and Grandsons and although we took 2 rooms for 2 nights after a booking error in the secondary building the only rooms we could get were on the club floor. They were lovely rooms but the $50 surcharge/per room for the club was a joke. Breakfast was served until 9:30 and when they ran out of food(coffee, toast, cream, milk, etc. at 9:15 they were reluctant and slow to replace and then at 9:29 with 10 people in llne they cleared the buffet. The computer did not work and the staff was unhelpful, indifferent and dismissive. Very disappointing.

<Title>“This was the worst experience I have ever had at a Sheraton- which is my preferred hotel”
<Content>I have not only stayed at various Sheraton location, but I have also stayed at this one and I was truly disappointed. Where should I start. I understand going green, that means no changing of the sheets and towels on the everyday basis. That does not mean no housekeeping at all. No garbage being taken out, no dishes being removed from the room. No housekeeping at all. Next, the restaurant and bar is being serviced by one-person when their is a convention in town- really- one person. I waited almost 20 minutes for a bell-hop to come and pick-up my luggage. No- wife in 2010 when you are paying over $200.00 a nite - unacceptable. Cheaper hotels have free wife. Lat but not least. I needed to fed-ex something back home and you have to go over to the first tower to the fed-ex location to pikc-up the boxes and then just because you are in the second tower you must pay an additional $10.00 to ship- just because I was not in the main tower- aren't you all the same establishment- just different towers, I cannot believe just because the hotel chose for me to stay in the Bay Tower instead of the Marina Tower that a delivery is going to cost me an additional $10.00. I was very unhappy with this stay and based on the traveling that I do for business and pleasure I need the Sheraton to look into these areas for improvement as well as classify the difference between going green and shortage of housekeeping service. I also forgot the main desk mixing up a delivery package between my co-worker and myself- thank goodness we knew each other to make the change. Or my package would have went to another customer. I also attempted to call the front desk on (2) occassions and the phone rang no less than 15-20 times before someone answered. I was truly disappointed in the service at this hotel on this occassion.

<Title>“Secondary Location, Crazy Add-On Charges, Plastic Cups, no SPG benefit”
<Content>Against my better judgment I booked this Harbor Island property which is well away from where the center of San Diego's enjoyable nightlife has relocated. The staff was pleasant in every way, but too many things weren't great, for example: * despite paying $279 my room looked out on a gravel rooftop * there were plastic drinking cups (think Holiday Inn) in the bathroom * no wireless Internet and $18.95/day charge to connect * $22 for one night to park my own car in an uncovered lot * $21 for a breakfast buffet * no acknowledgement for being Starwood Gold, and no benefits offered With taxes, the Internet, parking and my typical buffet breakfast the tab for one night was $355. Sorry, but that's way too much for just an average property in a secondary location.

<Title>“Expected Much Better”
<Content>The Marina Tower Townhouse was a surprise upgrade. Well appointed rooms and bathroom but what had us not wanting to go back was the service and valet fees of $28 and the late check out charge of $10/hour after noon. WOW!! And we are Starwood Members. We previously stayed at the Bayview Tower for our first honeymoon and it is by far better. Even with this upgrade the Bay Tower was just off the charts and just a better property. Seems as if things have gone down since 2004. Called to the front desk on several occasions and no one ever picked up the phone. We absolutely love San Diego but will stick with our Marriott family of hotels or the Westin.

<Title>“BEAUTIFUL and VERY CLEAN!”
<Content>Sheraton Harbor Island Drive took my breath away the moment I stepped into the lobby and then again the moment we got into our room. Everything about the room made me comfortable. I loved the white comforter. So clean,thus when its very white and remained white, you know the hotel actually is very clean. Very white towels, white sheets--just made me feel right at home.

<Title>“Great location but disappointing in many ways”
<Content>While the location was great and the views from our room were terrific, there were several disappointing features: 1. No WIFI in the hotel rooms - hard to believe that there is no WIFI in hotel rooms -- people were huddled down in the lobby to gain access to the only free Wifi in the building 2. Nickel and diming attitude - children's tv channels which are normally part of the standard cable channels at a house or hotel - here Sheraton wanted to charge so that my daughter could watch the Disney 3. Concierge - turns out that Sheraton has "outsourced" its concierge to Expedia...so tix to Seaworld instead of being at the best possible price (which is normally what a concierge would work hard to do), were charged at Expedia rates which equalled highway robbery (20-25% more than buying the tix ourselves) 4. Website of hotel boasts of kayaking -- the kayak facility is seasonal and wasn't open 5. The bicycles available for hotel guest rental are old, worn, and barely functional 6. A Club dining room with NO hot water or amenities after hours..all they had was a refrigerator with water bottles and a bowl of sad-looking fruit...and NO wifi up in the club room either In all a lot of small details that added up to a disappointing "resort" experience...

<Title>“It was ok”
<Content>I went on priceline put in a bid for a four star hotel for $100/night. I really didn't think I would get anything, but this came in. I was pretty excited at first, until I read the reviews. I figured for what I paid a night it would be worth it. They put us in the marina tower, and just like the other reviews, this is a bit older tower and not as nice as the main one but it had great views! The beds are comfortable and clean. The only wierd thing is the towlets have the loudest flush I have ever heard. You can hear when other rooms flush them too. We had a little airplane noise, but not too bad. We ended up falling asleep on the balcony one night, it was very relaxing. We had a car and the location was perfect for us, since we spent alot of time cruising the bay. All in all, if you can pay $100 a night like we did, it is a great value.

<Title>“Too many add on charges”
<Content>The room was OK. The view was terrific and the location was good. The beds were too hard and uncomfortable. The real problem, however, was the add on charges that just kept piling up. $22 a day to park is ridiculous. $11 a day for internet is even more ridiculous, especially considering it isn't wireless or high speed. There are no vending machines, or if there are they make them impossible to find, and the prices for the in room refrigerator are unbelievable. And room service-$16 for pancakes. Come on! You people need to go out in the real world. Even Super 8 has free high speed wireless internet. This hotel is really about a two star that is trying to act like(and charge like) its a five star.

<Title>“I loved this hotel.”
<Content>I am so surprised as I read some of the previous negative reviews. I stayed here for 6 nights and thoroughly enjoyed my visit. The hotel is conveniently located to many of the tourist sites which made it easy to tour after our conference. The service at the restaurant was excellent. The waitstaff was prompt, attentive, warm and friendly. They made me feel like they really cared whether I enjoyed my meal or not. We used valet parking and received our car within minutes of our request. The valet staff was courteous and again friendly. In fact every hotel staff person that I dealt with was extremely helpful. Everyone greeted me when I passed them and always looked me in the eye which made me feel like they were really focused on me. The ambiance of the hotel was lovely. The comfortable seating areas in the lobby were great for socializing and relaxing. There were computers available for guests which helped me a great deal. The decks and patios were lovely to sit on to gaze at the beautiful view of the marina. In the evening it was so nice to sit outside at one of the fire pits and relax in a rocking chair in the cool San Diego night air. My room was on the ground floor which made me a little nervous because of the sliding glass door. Therefore, I didn't open the drapes. I would have liked to have let light in but it was too easy for anyone to see inside the room since I faced the parking lot. I would have preferred a view of the marina and a room higher up. However, the room was clean, comfortable, quiet, and had a cheerful decor. I was surprised that being so close to the airport, I rarely heard a plane. Maybe being downstairs was a plus! I enjoyed my stay here and would love to return.

<Title>“Disappointment in this Sheraton property”
<Content>Staying in the Bay Tower. Hotel parking is very limited and costly. The room was nice until you start to hear the noise around bedtime. Toilet flushed like a cruise ship and you could also hear the bathroom noise from other guests. Airport noise was not too bad, not much can be done about that. I have stayed at other Sheraton properties and have been pleased with the hotel. This property to me does not measure up to the name. Staff was nice at both towers and friendly, no complaints there. They should not charge for internet use. Other lower priced properties don't charge. I was very disappointed about the $11.95 fee.

<Title>“Enjoyed our Stay”
<Content>Our family stayed here prior to our visit to Sea World. We stayed on the Club Level and our room had a wonderful view of downtown San Diego. Most of the staff we encountered was very friendly. The room itself was clean and the beds were awesome. We enjoyed being able to open the balcony door and the view was fantastic. In other reviews people complained about airport noise , we were able to sleep just fine. The only thing that we were concerned about was that pets were allowed in the hotel and my husband is allergic to pets. I did not see on the website that the hotel was pet friendly and if I had known that I would of put a note in the reservation to make sure that we were not in a room that just had a pet in it. The lobby had nice places to sit and relax however we preferred to be outside. The weather was lovely and they were showing a movie in the pool area the night we arrived. The fitness center was a nice feature that had adequate amount of treadmills, stationary bikes and weight equipment. They also have two ping pong tables so that the kids and adults can play. The pool area was very cute and clean when we went the next morning. If you book in the Club Level you are given access to the Club Lounge the next morning which provides you a nice continental breakfast. If you are able to get a good deal on the Club Level it is worth the upgrade. I think it is a great hotel for families who can splurge on a nice weekend get away or vacation. The only negative is the parking, if the hotel is full you might have a hard time finding parking closer to your tower. Not everyone might enjoy the long walk from the parking lot to their building. In addition, the parking is a $22.00 fee and I would hope that the management would improve the parking situation. P.S. Be ware of the Mini Bar in the room, I had already read about and had even requested them to empty it out. However, when I got to the room the Bellman even advised us to becareful with the mini bar. If the sensor is messed with they will charge you for the mini bar. I opened the cabinet door and found that the mini bar had not been emptied.

<Title>“This hotel has gone downhill in the past 2 years!”
<Content>This hotel had many problems. No one answered the phone--operator, room service, guest service...NO ONE! They have NO towel bars in the bathroom yet encourage going green and reusing towels--that can NOT be hung up! They had an earthquake and we were swaying on the 8th floor, but when I went down the elevator to find out if we might be evacuated as they were 2 months ago the staff said they NEVER evacuated! Lying to guests is not good customer service--and they had no idea what to say to all the concerned guests!! The consierges were wonderful and the restaurant staff, but the rest of the hotel NOT too great!!!

<Title>“A shaky mix of positives and negatives.”
<Content>Let me start by saying I am not normally the complaining type, after spending 17 years as a travel agent - - I've seen my fair share of hotels and know stuff happens when travelling and you need to just roll with it sometimes! We just returned from a 3 night stay at this property, at which I'd reserved the AAA 'Hot Deals' rate which includes an upgrade to a deluxe room and $50.00 food/beverage credit per day. I printed the confirmation which stated our rate of $159.00 per night was for a room in the Bay Tower, along with the upgrade/credit Terms associated with that AAA deal. When we arrived, I was given the keys to a room in the Lanai section of the hotel (basically, out in the boondocks .. obviously an older part of the hotel and on the ground floor). I asked about the Bay Tower room on my confirmation and was informed the hotel was100% booked and it was all they had. I could check the next day for an upgrade. It was somewhat late (9:45pm) and we were exhausted - - so we went to the room. It was clean, and decorated in a crisp nautical decor .. but the ceiling seemed lower than normal, giving it a cavelike feel and the windows opened up to the back of the green tarp surrounding the tennis courts and a rooftop full of steam vents, etc. peaking over that. The extremely bright lights of the tennis courts were a nuisance. The showerhead was impressive looking.. the size of a dinner plate! ...but the water pressure was pitiful. I couldn't believe we'd paid $159.00 .. plus $22.00 parking and taxes, amounting to about $200.00 a night - for this! I've gotten some pretty decent rooms through Priceline for less than half that at other hotels. Ugh. The next morning, I went to the front desk and asked to be moved. They had a room available in the Marina Tower, 7th floor...which sounded like a drastic improvement over the room we spent the night in. My husband and teenage daughter were off taking sailing lessons in the harbor for Father's Day .. so I decided to take the room and move our stuff so they could be happily surprised at the end of their day. Silly me, I asked if there could be SOME sort of compensation .. perhaps a comp. day of parking? .. for my troubles and the fact that we were actually downgraded instead of upgraded - - but the gentleman said the parking is separately owned and he couldn't discount it. Terrible customer service, in my opinion. After getting all of our belongings into the new room, I noticed the air conditioner was not working! Aaaggghh!!! I called maintenance not once, but twice .. and after 2 hours of waiting - - the guy arrived and quickly fixed it. At that point I was just relieved to not have to move again. LOL. Now for some positives .. the hotel itself has a very appealing ambiance with the nautical decor and gorgeous views of the water, boats, etc. The pool area is nice as well, with rock work and waterfalls and daily activities for the kids. The restaurant food was good, although pricey ($68.00 for breakfast for the 3 of us, $20.00 for a plate of chicken nuggets/fries and a soda) and is set along an expansive wall of windows overlooking the harbor as well. There's a Starbucks in the lobby, so at least there's an option for something less expensive. The rooms are comfortable and fresh, lovely views (from the tower rooms..haha) but be prepared to hear the sound of jets taking off at the airport which is in very close proximity. The Fitness Center is large, lots of equipment. And next to that are a couple of ping pong tables .. which people seemed to be enjoying every time I was in the gym. The parking lot is also a big negative. WAY too small for such a large property. If you go down one aisle and can't find a spot, it is blocked on one end and you have to actually back up to exit to look down the next aisle! Two out of the three nights, we returned after going into town - - only to find NO parking available except for way out on the Lanai side of the hotel. We had to walk all the way through that section to the Marina Tower to our room. Shoulda stayed in the cave, I guess. Last, but not least, when we received our bill on the last day - - the $50.00 per day food/beverage credit was nowhere to be found. I had to stand in line at the front desk in order to have it adjusted. She apologized with a smile and thanked me for staying with them.

<Title>“I was rather disappointed by this hotel...”
<Content>I was rather disappointed by this hotel. The location and views were great but that is were the positives end. The bed was very comfortable, but there were what appeared to be blood stains on our sheets. The cleanliness of the hotel I would say to be below average and our shower curtain was also stained pink at the bottom. But, the worst aspect of the hotel had to be the noise. It was the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed at. I felt like I was in a college dorm again. I don't know if it was the guests that were there when we were or that their walls and windows are paper thin, but it made for a bad stay.

<Title>“I would stay here again”
<Content>I got this hotel with a great rate thru Hotwire, but when reading the reviews I was a little concerned with the location since I was not renting a car. But taxis were always available at the hotel and for the tourist spots we hit, the rate averaged 8 to 13 dollars. The zoo being the most at 17.00. All the tourist spots we hit had taxis waiting outside so you never had to wait for one. This was perfect for my daughter and I. There were also concerns after reading the reviews that we were booked at the Bay Tower and not the Marina Tower. That was not a big deal either. After being gone from 8 am to 10 pm every night it didn't matter to us. When we were driving back to the hotel you come to the Marina Tower first. My daughter and I would stop there and go to their bar/restaurant and sit outside and have a drink. Then we would catch the shuttle that seemed to always be there when we were ready to go and it would take us to the Bay Tower. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful too. Very important when you are from out of town and trying to figure out where to go and how to get there. Hotel was clean. They offer 5 dollar vouchers to not remake your room everyday. We used one every morning for breakfast at the restaurant at the Bay Tower. We thought this was really a nice place to stay. We wanted to go to La Jolla and w/o a car it would have been expensive by taxi. There is a visitor information center down by the Harbor who can give you any information you need to get around. We went to Seaport Village and they have a booth that sells all kinds of combination tickets at a discounted price. We bought a Seal Tour, Midway tour and zoo as a package and saved money. All in all a great trip.

<Title>“I doubt that I will ever return”
<Content>I am a pretty seasoned traveler and have stayed in dozens of hotels in the last 10 years. Sheraton San Diego had the distinction of being the first hotel that I ever found a live bug (identified by my 11 year old cousin) crawling in the bedding and also the first where I found hair in the bathroom AND no soap when I entered the room. We got our breakfast comped because of the bug incident, but not much was done about the hair other than it was cleaned while I was gone. Room was actually nice, front desk personnel very friendly, but those two incidents stick out. I must also say, although this has little to do with the hotel, that I was disappointed with Priceline because this is listed as a downtonw/Gas Lamp hotel, and this is hardly the case. It is a $12 cab ride to that area.

<Title>“Nice hotel - but no WIFI in room”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel June 2010 for a conference. The hotel is nice, and the staff is extremely helpful, especially the woman who helped find my reservation when it was spelled wrong. However, for the price, I expect to have internet access in my room without paying more. The hotel charges $11.95 / day more to get a wired connection in the room. The only place to get free WIFI is in the lobby, which if you're in the Lanai building, is a walk through the other building. The Lanai building is an older building, and quieter than the other towers. The sliding glass door, out to the balcony, is very nice and quiet. Overall, it's a nice hotel near the airport, but the lack of wifi makes a business trip difficult

<Title>“Nice and quiet for being by an airport”
<Content>This is a nice, quiet and clean hotel close to airport. A little further than I wanted from the things we did. There is no trolley stops at or near this hotel, so you would need a car or take a taxi. It is approx. 3 - 5 miles from downtown gas lamp quarters. If you rent a car be prepared to pay $28 a day to park it at hotel, a little pricey if you ask me! No restaurants or shopping within walking distance. Hotel restaurant very pricey! When we checked in there were dirty dishes outside the room on the floor from previous guests that stayed there for 4 out of our 6 days there, complained three times before they finally picked them up. Overall hotel experience was great! If you drive to downtown be prepared to pay $20 to park. Seaworld is great, but spend the whole day as there is alot to see and do. Do not waste your money on the zoo. Definitely go to the USS Midway Museum. If you have a rent car to to LaJolla Beach and see the baby seals that hang out there.

It is a large hotel that is clean and upper scale. The rooms were comfortable and the beds were really nice. I got a great rate on this hotel of $120 through the hotel's website, which I thought was a deal, especially since is was not through priceline or expedia, etc. I woudl stay here again for sure.

<Title>“This Sheraton Rocks!”
<Content>I had the best stay here. Really comfortable bed and beautiful view of the bay (city view). They have an excellent green option - for each day you forego maid service, you receive a $5 certificate to be used in any of the restaurants. They have bikes to rent for $7/hour and you can ride along the water on the bike path right into downtown. Takes about 20 minutes to get to Sea Port Village by bike. The staff are super friendly. You will love staying here!

<Title>“Great Place to Stay”
<Content>My husband and I recently booked this hotel thru a Priceline special for $99 a night when most four star hotels were charging $250 per night due to the marathon. We were very pleased with the choice. The hotel is a short cab ride ($15) to the Gaslamp area. There is a nice shuttle to pick up/drop off near the airport. We didnt stay in the main tower but this wasn't a problem as we still had a pretty view of the marina, and a huge room. The room was clean, nicely decorated, and very comfortable. While it is close to the airport this was not a problem as the airport seems to be situated near most everything so the noise would have been a factor anywhere. I only heard the planes a couple times and it never bothered our sleep. We enjoyed our stay!

<Title>“Wonderful week”
<Content>For over a year we planned a family vacation with all of our children, their spouses and the grandchildren. The rooms were great, and we all had a wonderful time. The check in was easy and the staff courteous, the restaurant food was good and they were very accomodating to our large group. It was easy access to the airport, downtown and other attractions like the zoo and legoland.Also easy access to walking by the bay. Thank you for a wonderful reunion.

<Title>“Nice Airport Hotel”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here for Memorial Day weekend. We got the hotel through a blind bid on Priceline and would have preferred a more downtown hotel (as the bidding area includes both the Downtown and Harbor regions) but at the end of the weekend were very pleased with the Sheraton. We checked in on Saturday evening and were very happy when the woman checking us in gave us a marina view. The hotel was bustling with activity and there were a lot of people using the internet access in the lobby and the Link access they had with a few computer terminals. We walked around the hotel and down the marina a bit and saw the two pools - one of the pool areas was showing The Little Mermaid which was a good idea if you had kids. I believe they have movie showings throughout the summer on Fridays and Saturdays on large screens outdoors. The room was nice with a very comfortable bed and a flat panel TV. The bathroom was on the smaller size but perfectly adequate. There was a balcony with a few lounge chairs that gave us a view of the marina. The hotel is a block away from the airport so if you have a morning or evening flight and want a hotel right near the airport, this is your choice. For the most part we really enjoyed the hotel. The only issue we had was that the parking area is very limited and we had to park in the back area and our car ended up pretty filthy because the back lot isn't paved and is a dirt lot. Considering the parking is $22/night it would be nice if they would at least pave the back lot so I'm not forced to get a car wash after staying there. Also, if you don't have a car you're somewhat limited in places you can go on foot. Overall this is a pretty good hotel and we'd be happy staying here again.

<Title>“Definitely not Starwood standards”
<Content>I have spent 6 nights at this hotel for a conference, and I have to say that the quality of the service is very poor. I had to change my room as the first one had not been cleaned (hairs on bathroom's floor, sticky desk), check-in was very long, room was "cleaned" at 3pm, free internet access not working properly etc.... The hotel offers you a voucher if you decline the cleaning for environmental purpose but most probably it is more a question of lack of staff. The hotel is located very close from airport, so convenient for one night but quite far from dowtown.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel, Unfortunately Away from All the Action”
<Content>This is definitely a beautiful 4 star hotel, probably good for conventions or business meetings. I was lucky enough to get the last room in the Marina Tower; I probably would have left had I been booked in the Bay Tower... I hate that "Annex" concept where they have those overflow bldgs that have none of the amenities and niceties of the main bldg. Luckily the lady at the check-in desk saw my face when she said Bay Tower and quickly made the adjustment to the Marina Tower with no complaints. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. My room was small, but very pretty, with gorgeous harbor, bay, downtown views and a balcony! The property was lovely. But huge minus for the location, unfortunately. I was expecting this to be walking distance to the gaslamp and other parts of downtown San Diego, but this is really better described as a very well done airport hotel (the airport is across the street). I'm a walker, and downtown San Diego is such a great walking area, but I had to get in my car to go anywhere. And speaking of car, I thought $22 for parking was quite steep considering the fact that we were not in the heart of downtown to begin with. So,mixed reviews on this place. It's pretty and will prob work if you're a business traveler or looking for something convenient from the airport. But, if you're looking for a place that's in the heart of it all, this is not your hotel.

<Title>“Good Location and Hotel for San Diego”
<Content>We had a really nice room that overlooked the water and had a balcony. The room was clean and had a gorgeous view (I think it was the 25th floor). I thought the hotel was centrally located in San Diego and we walked to a lot of restaurants and activities. It has a Starbuck's in the hotel, which is nice. It also has a really, really nice fitness center. I thought check in was good, but check out was a bit of a hassle. The check out machines were down, so we had to wait in the line. However, I have never had good luck with San Diego hotels. I don't know why, but usually I don't have a good experience. This was a nice change.

<Content>Hi, I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights . The dance festival used this hotel as the host hotel. I enjoyed the great location, free airport shuttle service, good food and the free internet use. The hotel also offers green incentives. I chose njot to have my sheets changes everyday and I received a $5 coupon for any restaurant in the hotel - very worth it!!! The staff was friendly and the spa area was quiet and relaxing - just what I was looking for.

<Title>“Don't stay in the Bay Tower”
<Content>We stayed in the Bay Tower because it has larger rooms and we needed a rollaway bed. The front desk gave us wrong directions to the I-5. We opted for the green option. That apparently means that you don't get any service at all. We didn't need our towels laundered every day but we did need toilet paper and soap. That took us about 30 minutes after my daughter found a cleaning person in the hall. We went over the the main hotel in the evening and found the Tapatini Bar (lobby bar) to be a great place for a drink. Scott is a great bartender and very good at making martinis. We can't say the hotel was all bad but if we stayed again, we would stay in the Marina Tower.

<Title>“Who Ever Said Business Couldn't Be Fun?”
<Content>My husband and I along with several colleagues stayed here for a large software conference in May 2010. What an experience! The first impression left by the front lobby and the staff of the front desk was incredible. Staff members were extremely helpful, courteous, and friendly. The check-in process was a breeze, and our wishes were accommodated. Our room was impeccable as well, and had a stellar view. We rated the beds "very good" only because there is no bed like home; they were very comfortable and inviting. Housekeeping was efficient, friendly, and also accommodating to our needs. The "Green Choice" program offered by the Sheraton is a fabulous idea and is beneficial to the environment while also making the guest feel like they're getting a bargain. I love that there was a Starbucks inside the facility. We tried Quinn's, and enjoyed it, but more, really enjoyed several meals at Papanani's, a little deli/eatery located between the two towers (the prices were very low, food was excellent, and the ambiance was incredible). Additionally, half-way through the week, we found that we had to extend our stay a day; the hotel was very accommodating and gave us the conference rate for the extra day. Parking is a little steep for us East Coasters ($22/day), but we found fairly cheap fares in the shuttles and vans available to hotel guests. Very conveniently located across the interstate from the airport; however, while inside the hotel room itself, we could not hear planes taking off and landing. The SheratonLink in the lobby offered free wireless internet and plenty of cozy seating areas for those who didn't want to pay for in-room services. For our first trip to California, we were very impressed, and would highly recommend the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina for business and pleasure.

<Title>“pleasant stay with young kid; would stay again”
<Content>I was cautious about staying at this hotel because of the number of negative reviews here. I was expecting a motel quality sheraton. Let me also tell you that I went with my wife and a two year old. Overall my stay was pleasant (especially for the price). I would stay again. It is literally walking distance from the airport - but the rooms are well sound proofed, and you cannot hear the planes. Even outside in the pool, we hardly ever heard the planes. The location is pretty good in that it is close to everything (short cab ride, no need to rent a car - we even gave our car back early because it was cheaper to use a taxi). However nothing is walking distance and the onsite restaurants are very expensive ($28 for linguini pomodoro!). The pools are clean and have a lagoon shape, but are not really resort style. but they are not the standard rectangle either. the hotel was clean and the staff friendly. no issues overall. i stayed in the Bay Tower (the one that is by itself). The other tower seemed to have a lot more activity/people, but the rooms were standard sheraton rooms. I had no issues with stains or anything like that. For families - there is a kiddie pool (which is essentially a 1 1/2 foot deep pool for kids the size of a spa). Sea World was $20 each way in taxi. Zoo is even cheaper. Downtown about $15 each way.

<Title>“Poor location, nice hotel for conference”
<Content>This hotel is a decent one for a conference- good amenities, close to the airport. Not great food onsite though and getting to downtown or any other parts of San Diego required a cab ride and some time. Beautiful views of the marina and the bay from many rooms. There are actually two buildings, about a five minute walk apart - we were not told this when making our reservation and ended up not staying where our conference was. This wasn't a difficult problem as it was a pleasant walk, but would have been difficult for people with difficulties walking or getting about. The staff were pleasant and helpful. Rooms were standard and clean.

However, the manager of the Sheraton offered a thoughtful resolution that went above and beyond my expectations. The professionalism, thoughtful solution, and time that was freely given to my situtation was remarkable. I want to say thank you to Warren, and his administrative assistant, Hilga. Your the best! I look forward to experiencing your beautiful hotel.

<Title>“Big Fat Disappointment”
<Content>If you really want to see San Diego and all it has to offer, don't stay here. The description the hotel website gives is a fabrication. There are 2 parts to this hotel- the "hotel" and the "motel". After thinking we were staying in a 4 star hotel with a view, we ended up driving up to our room with an outside door in the motel portion and had a view of a fence and if we looked up, the airport. SUPER disappointing. The girl that checked us in was unfriendly and unwilling to move us or ensure we would get moved the next day. The hotel did move us after the first night, but the view was still not great. The rooms are just ok, but not 4 star quality rooms. It is about a 10 minute drive downtown. There is very little to do in the area where the Shearton is located, yet parking costs $30 per night. San Diego offers SO much... do not stay here. Stay downtown or on Coronado. I was willing to lose my money on our room at the Shearton just to get the heck out of there.

<Title>“Great venue, pleasant staff, wonderfully comfortable beds”
<Content>We stayed for 1 day en route to a Panama canal cruise. Having read some negative reviews prior to leaving England, we booked in after a 23 hr journey with trepidation! Ok, so the reception seems understaffed & checking in took 20 minutes - but, our room was fine, the view was onto the tennis courts, we thought it may be noisy as it was on the ground floor near the swimming pool - it, was so quiet and the beds were soooo comfortable. In fact the only disruption we had was from noisy americans laughing outside the door at 3am! The food in the bar area was good as was breakfast and the staff so pleasant and helpful, particularly the waitress at breakfast, who went to great pains to introduce all those going on the cruise before we left the restauraunt. Overall we were impressed & thankful that the negative reviews were unfounded. As it is so near to the airport, would definately stay here again and hope for a room on a higher floor .

<Title>“A wonderful hotel with beautiful views of San Diego”
<Content>We visit our children in San Diego once or twice a year. It is late when we arrive and we love to stay at the Sheraton Bay Wing for a night or two. We ask for an upper floor for a better view. You can see the city lights, cruise ships, the Coronado Bridge , military ships and so much more. The rooms are nice, and very clean. We have always had very good service with a smile from all the employees. The only down side is, if you don't have a car, it is a bit of a walk to the wharf and town. However a cab ride is only about $15.00. The hotel food is quite good and room service food is very good with prompt service. We will continue to stay there every time we are in San Diego.

<Title>“Good location, great staff but a little bit shabby.”
<Content>Recently stayed in Marina Tower on the 6th floor for a week. Location was excellent and taxi's to most attractions such as Sea World, Zoo, Gas Lamp are approx $15 each way. The lobby and grounds are immaculate and first impressions are excellent. Check in was prompt and efficient. The room was a good size but it felt a little shabby due to scuff marks on walls, stained grout around shower, stains on furniture, rusty fire sprinklers, etc. There wasn't one single issue that was enough to complain about, but combined they did take the gloss of the early impressions of the hotel. I also noticed numerous stains on the carpet in the hallways and the ice machine on the 6th floor was out of order for the duration of our stay. I'm not a big fan of Starbucks, but I was glad it was there as the restaurant has a fairly limited breakfast menu and is a little expensive for it's standard. Quinn's pub is a nice place to have a quick meal and a drink. The reason we would return to this hotel is the staff. As it was our first time in San Diego we availed of the concierge desk on a few occasions. The ladies on the desk are fantastic and seemed genuinely happy to help. We would rate the hotel a 4.0 based on our experience. If a little more time was spent ensuring everything worked and was clean the rating would be a 4.5

<Title>“Exceeded Expectations!!”
<Content>As a traveler of over 150 nights a year, I stay in a lot of hotels. among the many, have been a fair mixing of sheratons across the country (Atlanta, Tampa, Cedar Rapids, Chicago, Minneapolis). NEVER before have I stayed at a Sheraton so glamorous, perfectly detailed and well thought out! Let's get a couple negatives out of the way first: -Front desk is understaffed and slow! Phones sometimes aren't answered promptly. -Over-priced breakfast restaurant. (although cheaper Starbucks is in hotel too!) -Would love to see mini-fridges included in rooms, as the expensive mini-bar is a big turn-off to everybody who isn't still living in the 1980's! -$22.00 a day to SELF-park! Ouch, folks. C'mon! There, that's the bad staff. Now, just a smattering of the numerous great elements of this facility: -Excellently furnished health club, with ping-pong tables outside. -Starbucks in the lobby! -Love the complimentary computers in the stylish lobby "nook" area. -Fun sports bar that seemed to be hopping at night. -UTTERLY FANTASTIC POOL AREA!! Beautiful fountains, and a pool that is one of the largest free form pools I've ever seen (and I've stayed at 4 resorts in Hawaii!) Also a hot tub that literally could seat 20 people comfortably! -Grounds are well-manicured, with rocking chairs strategically placed to view the adjacent marina-yacht club and relax. -Balconies in all rooms are perfect for viewing the yacht club on one side of hotel, or downtown skyline on the other (can't go wrong with either view) -Rooms are comfortable with flat-screen tv's and nautical colors and decor in deep blue, burnt orange, and white. -Gorgeous lobby with wonderful mood lighting and an aquarium about the size of 2 French doors put together! All in all, can't say enough good about this place. Simply loved it and would not only welcome a chance to return, but would go out of my way to make it happen!!

<Title>“Convenient Location, Decent Room, a Bit Over-Priced”
<Content>This hotel was sufficient for the needs of my wife and myself, but given the price and my wife's SPG status, I would have expected better. We were placed on the 4th floor above the pool, in which we experienced loud enough pool noise to require earplugs to sleep. Although not pleased, we were leaving on a very early flight, thus our decision to stay at this location. The bed was comfortable and bathroom sufficient, but service was lacking. When we asked the Concierge about the airport shuttle, they said we could catch the first shuttle with no problem. As it turned out, we had to wait 2 shuttles before we could get to the airport. The pool area might have been nice, but we did not have time to enjoy it.

<Title>“Exceeded my (high) expectations!!”
<Content>My husband, son (7) and I had the pleasure of being guests at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina for two nights pre-Panama Canal cruise at the end of March (March 26-28). This was an extra special trip for my husband's 40th b-day. ALL the Sheraton staff (kudos to the manager, Keri Robinson, in particular) went above and beyond to make the stay so special for us. The views from our balconies (yes, two!) were superb. Dining at both the pub/restaurant and the Sheraton Dining Room within the hotel were excellent. I think the Pub/restaurant was a very good value for the $. Some reviewer noted a lumpy bed. Well, not in the room I had. Yummo-- I slept like a princess. The staff was always wearing a kind smile, but not in a fake attitude way that you sometimes encounter at hotels. If ever in San Diego again I will definitely stay at this hotel. Although this hotel is often overlooked by cruisers for a prestay visit, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. Cabs can take you anywhere you want to go pretty quickly. Also car rentals can be found super cheap if you do comparison shopping. The parking was a little high, but the place is well worth it in my opinion. ~ (Parking fees are clearly stated on the website so I don't know why people on here complain about not having prior knowledge of it. Any hotel is not resposible to post all fees with "neon" signs. Potential guests need to take resonsibility and be proactive in ASKING about fees and/or looking for a fee chart)~

<Title>“this hotel was horrible”
<Content>Okay, maybe not the absolute worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I stayed there because my conference was in the hotel. I didn't see any cockroaches. There was no green water coming from the faucet. It has an excellent view of the harbor. And it is very close to the airport. But this hotel was not good at all. First off, the bed was lumpy, which made it hard to sleep. Also problematic for sleeping was that the walls were so thin you could hear anything and everything going on in neighboring rooms, even coughs. This hotel really needs to invest in some soundproofing. The hotel is not within walking distance of anything. You need to take a cab to get anywhere. It wouldn't be so bad if the restaurants in the hotel were really good...they are not horrible but not places I would want to eat every meal for five days. There was a sound akin to that of crickets in the vent. I called the reception to get them to fix it, they said they would come, but never did. I called again and still no action, then gave up.We had to call the reception to get the bathtub unclogged. They did eventually come and got it cleared but the drain was still pretty slow and got worse as the week went on. About half the times we called the reception there was no answer. The concierge was not that helpful. I stayed in the hyatt near the convention center during an earlier conference and oh how I longed to have been staying there as our taxi passed it on our way to restaurants. Anyway, I would suggest staying somewhere else. This is a pricey hotel and from what I gather, you are paying for a nice view and little else.

<Title>“Don't pay full price, and try for the club room.”
<Content>I was here for a conference but found a cheaper rate on expedia for the club room. The breakfast includes hot/cold cereal, fruit, toast, bagels, juice, coffee, pastries. And there is an evening reception which includes veggie platters, fruit, crackers with dips, cookies, free soft drinks, cheeses, and 2 choices of hot appetizers (pot stickers, chicken nuggets, mini sausage rolls etc). Also there is free wireless in the clubroom and a computer with free printer. My hotel room was on the small side so the clubroom was nice to escape to. Downsides of this hotel are: not many close dining options, very few TV channels, small rooms, and not worth paying full price for. I would say this hotel should more accurately be rated a 3* so if you come expecting (and paying) more, you might be disappointed. I have stayed in Fairmont and Pan Pacific properties that have the little details which are worth paying more, but this Sheraton is worth paying a 3* price.

<Title>“Good stay at Sheraton Hotel and Marina”
<Content>This was my second stay at the Sheraton, having once again won the room on Priceline with a 4* bid in the downtown area. I was extremely happy when I arrived at around 11 AM and was immediately given a room. While I was in the Bay Tower last time, this time I was placed in the Marina tower. I was placed in a corner room on the 12th floor. I found this room to be a little smaller than the Bay Tower room, but perhaps a little better appointed. The shower and sink were quite nice. This tower also had much nicer grounds with a nice pool and spa area. The restaurants on premises were, as usual, pricey though had a good view. The on-premises Starbucks was a nice breakfast option if you didn't want to pay for the highly priced buffet breakfast. This hotel also offered some nice services. They have a free airport shuttle that runs on a constant loop about every 20-30 minutes. You can call for the shuttle, but I think it will just show up ... funny thing ... if you do call and select the option for the shuttle in the phone system, it will kick you back to the menu. There is a Microsoft center in the lobby offering free wi-fi and a few free computer terminals with printers. There is a charge for internet in room. The biggest negative for this hotel is probably its location if you want to do anything downtown. I saw a trolley stop, so that may be an option, or you could also take about a $10-15 cab ride downtown.

<Title>“Not worth the price”
<Content>What's the point of opening a hotel with say, 500 rooms, and not providing a garage to park in? A parking fee of 14 dollars per night is way too much. The rooms are small, smell like shoe freshener and the bathrooms are small with a tiny sink. You're better off staying at a less classier place for half the price. The location blows; right by the highway and there's nothing but a huge green mountain right behind the hotel. This place is more like 2 stars as I work for a 4 star 5 diamond joint in Vegas and I find it hard to believe that the Sheraton is only 1 star less. Give me a break.

<Title>“Good experience, great view”
<Content>I got a great price on Sheraton's web site and they upgraded me to the Marina Tower facing the water and downtown - peaceful, beautiful. The staff were exceptionally pleasant and attentive. As for the facility and the room it's about what you expect from the Sheraton brand. I'd stay there again.

<Title>“Drive on by and stay at the Hilton down the road!”
<Content>Great views from the upgraded rooms. Garden views are of the airport rental car lots. Lovely facility. Problem is that they want your money! It costs $22.00 to park you car everynight and then you get to walk a half a mile to get to it. There are 10 channels on the TV and nothing you want to watch. Of course the bars are open ready to accept your money. We stayed 2 nights at $130 (+22.00 FOR PARKING). When we asked to add another night, we were told that it was $299.00 and there were plenty of rooms available. Staff recommended that we check Expedia for a cheaper rate. We checked out and went to the Hilton right down the road. Rooms and Beds way more comfy there. Same views and much nicer staff. Try the Hilton first!

<Title>“Nice view, very close to the airport, spacious rooms, great breakfast”
<Content>The hotel was chosen because my wife was attending a conference there, with activities during 4 consecutive days. It is located just a few minutes from the airport and the hotel has an eficient shuttle service every 10-15 minutes to and from the airport. Rooms at Bay Tower are kind of 30% bigger than those at Marina Tower. We had 2 double beds. Great breakfast. No free internet in rooms, just in lobby. The shuttle can take you to the airport where there is a bus line to downtown reached in 10 minutes. Beautiful ambience. Nice decoration. Spacious. Some noise from helicopters of a Navy base at the other side of the bay.

<Title>“Huge disappointment”
<Content>We stayed here for one night (thank goodness) before a cruise and as a regular Sheraton guest at other properties I expected this to be in the same league - wrong ! we stayed in the Bayside tower which was probably the first mistake, we heard from other guests that the marina tower was better. They say this hotel has been renovated - what that means is a pretty lobby and new wallpaper in the bedrooms. couch in our room was dirty, bathrooms were a disgrace ( outlets hanging out of the wall), worn out towels. we complained the the receptionist who just shrugged her shoulders. The restaurant was only open for breakfast and that was expensive however we found a little deli by the marina that did great food for very reasonable prices. This property is barely a motel by my rating !!

<Content>We had a loverly short 4 night stay at the Sheraton San Diego. Our room was comfortable and we found service to be great. The restaurants had great food, although a little pricey. The service at the restarurants was generally very good and most of our waiters we very good with our 4 year old daughter. We were there for Thanksgiving and the Thanksgiving lunch/dinner was excellent. We loved San Diego it's beautiful.

<Title>“Do not stay here”
<Content>I stayed for two nights at this motel and experienced terrible service, especially for a very expensive motel. The worst part was that we left a package to be shipped FedEx over-night back to us at the front desk. I have done this many times before at other motels without incident. The day after we arrived back from our trip we expected to receive our package but did not and could not find any indication it had been shipped by the motel. I called to find out if the Sheraton had shipped the package and they said they did not know if they still had the package (!60 lds and large) and the Sheraton claimed they could not find out if they still had it or not. I did get a call back hours later but they just said they could not find the package and to wait until tomorrow. We needed this package quickly which was why we shipped it over-night. I also expect a motel to be able to check and see if they have or do not have a large package. I am still waiting to see if we get our package back.

<Title>“Was excited for a view I never got. Standard Sheraton.”
<Content>I booked this hotel on Priceline for a weekend stay in San Diego. In the end, our stay was perfectly fine. I was disappointed however, after reading the hotels website, at the room we ended up with. We got what I like the refer to as the 'Priceline Shaft'. This is when you typically end up in a room that is of lesser quality than a regular room in the hotel, simply because you booked on Priceline. Some hotels can't do this because all rooms are basically identical. The Sheraton Marina, on the other hand, quite easily put us in this category. To be honest, there was nothing really wrong with the room itself. I was more put off by the location. The website advertised how almost all the rooms had a view of the skyline or the marina. Ours had a view of the backside of a tennis court. Not only that, but we were in some random satellite building that wasn't really connected well to the hotel. I also was severely unimpressed about the fact that our room had exterior corridors, very motel-like. There was no security for my door and anyone could have wandered up the driveway and knocked on our door. It was really bizarre to see this type of building in a Sheraton - I was certainly not expecting it. Once I accepted the motel atmosphere, the room was fine. It was fairly standard with most Sheratons, but decorated in a nautical theme. We had two beds, a desk, and a bathroom. It was not an overly large room, but not small by any means. The bathroom was a bit tiny and the lack of ventilation in it, something I find common in the US, was a little suffocating. Outside the room, the hotel had a full service Starbucks that we enjoyed although I think the prices were mildly higher than normal. There was also a restaurant and a lounge that we did not sample. I didn't see a fitness center, though I'm sure one exists. We walked by the pool a couple of times to get to the main hotel - it seemed nice. Never busy due to the cooler climate. Rooms contain internet for a fee, or you can go to the lobby for free wireless. There is also the Sheraton Link in the lobby, which provides free computers with internet for registered guests. At other hotels this area has been packed with people however I rarely saw anybody using them at this hotel. Location wise you are not really around much, but it is still a nice location. The airport is basically next door, so it is convienient if you are using it in conjunction with an airline. The marina is behind the hotel, if for some reason you are headed in that direction. My favorite part was that is was located on Harbor Island (not an island - attached to land). This provided a long Bay-front walking path with fantastic views. A drive downtown was 5 minutes. Overall this hotel was satisfactory to stay at. I wasn't happy with being in the two level outside building, and there were a few expensive add-ons ($22 parking etc.) that irritated me during my stay. But we had good sleeps, the proximity to downtown was appreciated, and we were comfortable. That's enough to earn 3 stars out of me.

<Title>“NICE BAY VIEW”
<Content>I booked it from Expedia for 100 something a day. I didn't know there's actually two hotel one is the Bay tower and the other one is the Marina Tower. We end up in the Bay tower. The room is big with sofa and a little desk table. the bed is really soft but the washroom is a bit small and not that clean. No fridge just a mini bar and it has a sensor on it...don't even open it. We're in the 11th floor and from our balcony we could see the fantastic view of the Marina and Downtown. It was nice after few months of winter in Canada. Transportation: we didn't even rent a car. On the first day we just hop on the trolley come in around 8:52AM and 9:52AM and this will bring you to the Seaport Village. You can also walk but its about an hour to the seaport village. Cab is about $15 one way including tip or a bus Route 992 I believe takes you to downtown. FOOD: we didn't eat in the restaurant, we eat in a small deli located between the two tower it's called papananni's I believe. or we just eat in the Seaport village. You can buy drinks in the delli as well. There's some drinks at the gift shop as well at the main lobby of the hotel. over all it was a great city and we will come back again.

<Title>“Good place to just sleep. Close to airport.”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina with a friend. The rooms were clean, and the bed and pillows were super comfy! Slept well the 3 nights I was there. The fitness center is nicely equipped, but the location was kind of weird to me- had to go outside and walk under the foundations of the hotel to get to it. I found it kind of creepy and scary when I had to go there by myself one night to get to the lone vending machine (which is next to the fitness center.) The rooms have complimentary Starbucks coffee. They also have a mini-bar/refrigerator in room which is on sensors and costs an arm and a leg, so don't even open it up!! (And don't move anything inside it, or you will be charged.) There were no vending machines around to purchase drinks, so you are stuck drinking water from the bathroom sink, or paying for a drink out of the mini-bar or one of the restaurants. (Hint- the fitness center does have a filtered water dispenser, so take an empty water bottle with you, and fill up in there. Run on the super nice treadmills for a few minutes if you don't want to feel like you are stealing! LOL) Showers were warm and felt great. There is supposedly a "spa" in the fitness center. Didn't see it. Think maybe it is just a room where they do facials ($95 for one hour) and massages with appointments. Location-wise: it was very close to the airport, and there is a shuttle that runs from the airport to hotel (and back) every 15 minutes or so. My friend and I were on a tight budget, so we thought we could walk most places from the hotel (the Gaslamp District, Balboa Park, etc are about 3 miiles away), but that's simply not feasible. Luckily, cabs are waiting for you at the hotel, and most downtown locations are within a $10 cab ride. Make sure you take the number of the cab company and a cell phone with you, though, because you can't just hail a cab when you are ready to return to the hotel, since they don't patrol the streets just looking for their next fare. You'll just need to call them, and they'll send out their next available ride to pick you up. The fare starts when you get in the car (not when you call.) Be sure to ask the concerierge where the closest X is before you just get in the cab and go. My friend and I wanted to go to IHOP for breakfast one morning, so we just jumped in the cab without researching the location. $20 cab fare later, we showed up at IHOP. Which, of course meant that we had to pay another $20 to get back. Most expensive IHOP pancakes I ever had! :) We would have been better off ordering room service and paying the $16 for 3 pancakes. I would really recommend renting a car and traveling up to La Jolla to visit Torrey Pines and the coves and beaches there. You can do a 12 hour car rental if you don't want to pay the $22 overnight parking fee. I'm starting to digress here, so let me just summarize with this: If you are looking for a clean comfy place to just sleep and take showers, this is a great hotel. If you are one who likes to use up everything that a hotel has to offer, this will probably end up being a very expensive vacation for you. Either way, it's in beautiful San Diego, and that's all that matters!!!!! Have a great trip~

Great service, clean and cozy rooms, centrally located, and 5 computers with free internet in the lobby! Yes, parking is $22/night, but I've never stayed at a 4-star hotel that didn't charge for parking. I will definately stay here again on my next trip to SD.

<Title>“Great Hotel and Location Don't expect SVO or Gold member perks”
<Content>Stayed one night for a memorial service at Point Loma. Hotel was great and location awesome. Room was clean and comfortable. Only complaint was asked for a late checkout and was told 2:00 pm anything after that would be $10 per hour and I can't offer that either. What ? why even mention the $10 and I can't give you that? My buddy who isn't even an SPG member let alone an SVO owner or Gold member get's a 4:00 pm checkout and I'm offered a 2:00 pm checkout like they we're doing me a favor. Stored my gear in his room instead. Very disappointed in how they treated me as an SVO owner with Gold membership. If you go here don't expect anything different than the non SPG membership, let alone SVO owner would get. Not sure I'll be back based on that alone. Great hotel otherwise.

<Title>“Very average hotel by Sheraton standards”
<Content>It's hard to appreciate the qualities of the hotel when all you see is what they don't have. We arrived in San Diego in the late evening and decided to go downstairs to eat. Normally, there is a folder that has the hotel amenities to include the hotel restaurants. Not there. The next day, we went to Phil's BBQ (Very good), but I wanted to write down the address. Looked for a pad and pen that normally comes in the room. Not there. In the morning I went to take a shower and after I dried myself off, I looked for a towel hanger... not there. Service was very good though. The people were very helpful and made us feel welcome, it's just too bad there was so much to focus on what was missing.

<Title>“Amazing View, Really Clean, Relaxing location”
<Content>I stayed in the Bay Tower in room 771. Wow! What a beautiful view of the bay. The room was really clean, with a very comfortable bed. A balcony that you can sit in and enjoy the sunset. The downtown area can be hectic so this was a geat relaxing location. Also there's a great walking path along the bay in front of the area and two great restaurants at both ends of the street overlooking the water. I would definately stay here again. Stay in the Bay Tower and get a room over looking the bay. There are two towers. The first tower is the largest and has all of the accomadations. Restaurants, etc. The Bay Tower is the second tower and is about a five minute walk from the first tower but has it's own parking. A more peaceful setting and the rooms are larger.

<Title>“Everything was great, until...”
<Content>We spent one night at the Sheraton at the marina in San Diego. We booked the room through Jet Blue vacations and got a lovely room with a great view at a great price. We enjoyed a delicious lunch at the 'casual' restaurant/bar where the service was attentive and the prices were comparable to our NYC area. Back to the room to relax and turn in early--we were headed for the border and a Baja adventure early the next morning. I turned down the bed and was quite distressed to see a BLOOD STAIN on the white sheet. Not terribly large, but quite noticeable, about the size of a dime. I called the desk to request that the bed be re-made, and a housekeeper arrived a while later--with a new sheet. When I asked her how this could possibly happen, she suggested that the morning housekeeper may have cut herself and bled on the sheets. When we requested that the ENTIRE bed be re-made, she provided us with new pillowcases as well. Absolutely no attention was paid to the blanket, mattress cover or the duvet. When we again asked for the entire bed to be attended to, she muttered something about the hotel's policy to save water; and then, when pressed for details, seemingly forgot how to speak English. We were too tired to request another room, had only a few hours before our early morning departure, so I thought that a Trip Advisor review would be more effective than just complaining to the management. This is the second Sheraton "adventure" we have had in the last few years. It will be the LAST.

<Title>“Beautiful hotel with most comfy beds”
<Content>My husband and I took a quick get away to San Diego for my birthday and got a great deal on Priceline for this hotel ($79 per night). We stayed two nights. Check in was a little slow, only one gal working the desk, and she said we were in the far away building but I asked to be in the Marina tower and she accommodated me (I did mention I was a Starwood member but not sure if that helped). Our room had two doubles but that was why we got the $79 price but it was ok. The beds were extremely comfortable. I'm not sure about everyone complaining about the noise and weight of the comforters but I was very comfortable and warm (but not too warm). Our room had a balcony that overlooked the marina and pool. There was plenty of storage in the room for clothes between drawers and the closet. There was a work desk with data ports for working but we set up a bar on the table. The room was a tad tight with the beds and furniture but was very doable for just two in the room. The bathroom was of good size and had a large vanity. The shower had good pressure and plenty of hot water. The amenities were nice. We ate breakfast in the restaurant and it was expensive and the service was very slow and the food was warm. Next time I might eat breakfast elsewhere. We almost had dinner in the sports bar but it was just too expensive for foo-foo-ish bar food so we took the car out of parking and drove to downtown to eat. Self parking was $22 per day, ouch. And being on Shelter Island, you pretty much had to drive everywhere else to eat or have drinks if you didn't want to pay the prices at the hotel. Internet in your room was like $14 or you could go down to the lobby for free wifi or use their business center. We did not use the pool or fitness center. We did take a taxi downtown one night and that cost was about $18 after tip. I really like this hotel but it's too far from downtown. It's really close to the airport, though. If I needed an airport hotel I'd certainly stay here. But next time I think we'll stay downtown.

<Title>“Convienent But Not Impressive”
<Content>Spent 5-days at the Sheraton for a combination trade show and time off with wife. Found the hotel for a good rate. Not disappointed but nothing exceptional. The hotel is right across from the airport. It is on a little island that is mainly marinas and though very close to lots of airport activity, you get a great sense of being away from the hustle and noise. You can see water regardless of where your room is. Our room looked out "front" from the older tower (there are two actual hotels in the complex). On the 3rd floor and we looked right across a small bay at the end of Coronado Island and the Navy facilities. Very pretty and relaxing. We had a small balcony and spent several nights enjoying a cocktail before bed looking out over the water. The area was very good for long walks along the water with great paved trails and landscaping. Great for walking and running. We walked to several local restaurants on the island and always felt invigorated. the rooms are in big need of renovation. We were in the older tower and you could tell. From what I understand the newer tower had just gone through a renovation and the older tower was next. Could not be soon enough. The room was loud and 70's throughout. The bathroom was dingy and needed updating badly. Housekeeping was very good and not saying the rooms were dirty - just older. The location deserves a little better hotel. Staff was very helpful and pleasant. Location is great for any business near the airport or downtown. I had a convention and was within a 15-minute cab ride of the conventions center and the awesome old district downtown. If you can get a cheap rate, this is not a bad place. If you are looking for more upscale, keep searching.

<Title>“Hotel with great views and the most comfortable bed you will ever sleep in”
<Content>We stayed January 8 - 11, 2010 and upgraded to the deluxe suite with a king bed and balcony on the 11th floor for only $20/night. (Not bad considering I only paid $77/night on Priceline for the room). Our view was excellent - We could see the bay, marina boats, airport, downtown, bridge to coronado.... We didn't do room service - not interested in paying the 19% automatic gratuity on an already overpriced breakfast. The bed was SO comfortable that we couldn't help but sleep in until at least 10am each day. It was THAT nice. The only issue we had was when we decided on a late dinner (9:30pm) and were recommended Fish Market. We took the $9 cab to get there only to walk in and find out they were closing for the night. This was very disconcerting -- we were so excited to eat there after both the front desk and the bell hop recommended it. The bell hop even called the cab for us, put us in the cab, and asked the cabbie to drive us to the Fish Market. You would think one of them would have looked at the time and thought enough to advise it was too late for dinner there. Instead we went to Gaslamp for a high end meal which was twice the price but delicious. We didn't have time to visit the fitness centre or any of the three pools because we were so busy going to Balboa Park, The Zoo, La Jolla, Old Town, Gaslamp, etc. Overall I would consider staying at this hotel again. The only drawback is the location. I think I might consider staying downtown next time so the cab rides are cheaper (or unneccessary).

<Title>“Great Views and Fabulous Stay for our Anniversary”
<Content>We got this hotel from Hotwire. After the name was revealed, I came to Trip Advisor, read the reviews and thought my anniversary trip was doomed. Of course, since I could not cancel it, we went and our experience was GREAT! We stayed in the Marina tower and the 8th floor. Our check-in was great! The customer service was excellent. The woman that checked us in told us upfront about the parking fees. She gave us alternative ways and costs to travel, let us check in at 11:00 am, and gave us a room with a great view! The concierge was fantastic. She suggested a great place for us to have lunch outside the hotel. The hotel was clean, beautiful, and quiet. We travel almost every weekend on business, so we know great hotel service. I was very pleased with the Sheraton. They treated us like we paid full price on the top level. I look foward to going back again.

<Content>Stay clear of this dump if you want to be ripped off with horrible customer service. We stayed on Xmas Eve and were hit with a $22 parking fee, even as a guest at the hotel. The hotel is next to a noisy airport so I guess they think all their guests are business travelers who don't care about parking fees since their company will pick up the tab? But we were just regular tourists. So I walk in the room and find an open can of Diet Pepsi inside the mini frig. I called the front desk so I wouldn't be charged and she asked "did you move ANYTHING in the frig?" I said, "Yes, I moved some stuff around to fit in our own snacks from home". And she said we'd be charged for everything that was touched, because it's all sensored. WTF? She insisted with her snotty "tough luck--you will be charged--nothing I can do" attitude until I asked to speak to a manager. The manager said they would waive the mini bar charges. Well gee thanks... A week later, when we checked our credit card, it was all screwed up with charges that weren't removed from the mini bar and charging us twice for parking @ $22 a night (when we were only there 1 night). It took 4 phone calls to correct our bill. Idiots! Another issue was the loud rumbling noise from the airport, not to mention their heaters in the room. It sounded like a freight train. Oh, and breakfast...Their menu prices are outrageous! Two (2) lousy pancakes are $15 bucks!, and that doesn't include anything-no egg, no bacon, no juice--just 2 pancakes. We have traveled the world and stayed at some beautiful high class places, but this hotel truly was the pits. I would never, in a million years, go back. The employees were so rude--maybe they were all pissed off that they had to work on Xmas?

<Title>“Not a 4 Star Hotel....at least the Bay Tower where Priceline guest stay”
<Content>I was pretty concerned about staying at this Hotel after reading reviews from other guest. I was a Priceline guest and was placed in the Bay Tower. The hotel staff offered me an upgrade to the Marina Tower or a higher floor in the Bay Tower for an additional fee which I declined. If youâ€™re looking to be within walking distance to the downtown area or Gaslamp district, this is not going to be your best bet. The room was decent size and nicely decorated but this hotel is definitely not a 4 Star Hotel. Iâ€™ve never stayed in a 4 Star hotel that had carpet stains in the lobby and in the rooms. Maybe they should use their $22 per day parking fees and hire a carpet cleaner for the hotel. Overall this hotel did have a bed, bathroom, and working shower but definitely not a 4 Star hotel by any stretch of the imagination.

<Title>“Great stay”
<Content>I was worried about this hotel after reading some reviews. We booked with priceline and did not have any problems when we arrived. The Marina tower was the first tower you see when you drive up and we did not have to move to the Bay tower at all. The front desk made sure everyone was taken cared of from what we can see while waiting our turn. The rooms were decorated nicely with a nautical theme, a nice touch for the area. But a bit small for family with kids. I believe the Bay tower has larger rms. The lobby was clean and spacious with a great view of the marina. In fact almost everywhere you went in this hotel you had a great view to look out at. Plus with a starbucks on location and a free wi-fi bar , we had made ourselves at home quickly upon check-in. Calling for addtional pillows was easy and quick. We made sure to tip the housekeep for their prompt service as well. The hot water and pressure was good for being on the 9th floor. Parking is $22 a day and can be difficult if there is a function going on. We had to park off to the side in a dirt lot one night, but it was still close within walking distance to the lobby.For the rest of our stay we made sure to walk along the harbour and relax in the hotel. The food served here was quite good too.

<Title>“Convenient to Airport but Not Much Else”
<Content>We booked this hotel a bit by accident, but got a pretty good rate. I reconfirmed directly with the hotel by email, requesting the main tower, ocean view. We did get main tower but view of downtown which was OK. Room was pretty standard with the Sheraton beds, which were a pleasure to sleep on. On 2 nights, the fire alarms went off in the middle of the night - with guests piling out into the parking lots. 25 minutes later we were allowed back in. Fire Dept. took 15-20 minutes to get there. Not so much as an i am sorry from hotel management. Some guests were demanding compensation. The hotel was busy with some Navy function going on and some conferences. We did not eat in the hotel but did stop for drinks in the lobby bar. What we like: the pool and hot tub which we used, a Starbucks on site but too busy with long lines so did not stop, convenience to airport. What we did not like: the parking lot for guests as we must be after thoughts for or the hotel as general visitor parking is same lot. We could not find a stall one night because the Navy guys took every space. Were paying $22.00 a day for??? The lot was gravel where we ended up parking. Overall the stay was OK but we would not stay here again. Other than proximity to the airport it is not convenient to anything and is on the dead end peninsula from the airport. It is not 4 stars no way but is a solid 3.

<Title>“If you are attending a conference here - stay somewhere else!”
<Content>Overpriced rooms in horrible locations for conference guests and poor customer service. Showed no consideration towards me as a lone female business traveller. Paid conference rate (only $10 less than rack rate) and dumped in a ground floor room looking out onto the parking lot with the taxi rank directly outside my window. Asked to move rooms (based on my safety concerns) and was told there were no other rooms available even though there were plenty still advertised online. After much discussion got moved to another room (still ground floor) but at least this time without the taxi rank infront of the window. Requested breakfast to be delivered to my room, waiter refused to leave it outside the door as I had to sign for it, no bathrobes are provided in the room so had to answer the door in my pyjamas. Am glad I hadn't already got into the shower before he came as there would be no way i'd open that door in just a towel. Placed a do not disturb sign on my door, and was awoken by a phone call at 9am from the cleaner asking what time I was planning on leaving so that she could clean my room. The next morning she just walked into my room without even knocking, luckily I was already dressed.

<Title>“Start off your international trip on the right note....book a room at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel near the Airport”
<Content>Traveling to Europe from the West Coast can be very stressful, due to the number of hours you are en route. Most flights out of our home town of San Diego depart around 7:00 am in order to connect to Europe via New York City or other hubs in the East or Mid-West. My husband and I solved the problem of having a sleepless night of worry about getting to the airport on time in the morning. You never do know if traffic will detain you, or if the shuttle or taxi will not show up on time. I think I share the emotions of many readers that you just can't relax before an international trip. Being dead tired before you start that 16-hour+ voyage is definitely not a good idea. This trip to Italy, we decided to book a room at the Sheraton Hotel & Marina, a first-class property that is literally within walking distance of the airport. The hotel offers a complimentary airport shuttle, but you could just as easily walk across the highway to reach the airport, if you are traveling light, as we were. The Sheraton's rooms are spacious, beautifully appointed (see photos), and a night's stay here is oh so very worth the price, all things considered. Spending a leisurely afternoon and evening watching the sun set over the city of San Diego or over the marina at Harbor Island added so much to our pre-trip pleasure. After a lovely seafood dinner, we strolled along the bay, holding hands and relaxing in the glow of a perfect November sunset in San Diego. In fact, we caught the final rays of the sun as we returned to our room, and relished the early morning sunrise that welcomed us the next day. What a wonderful way to begin our memorable trip to Italy!

<Title>“Wonderful Weekend”
<Content>I found this hotel through Travelzoo and booked it through Starwood which I think is the parent company. I got a great deal and was able to pick the Marina tower on a high floor. I read the reviews and I was worried that I wouldn't get what I had booked but that was not the case. The person checking us in was very friendly and helpful! We got a room on the 11th floor facing the marina and bay. It was beautiful! The room was very well appointed and appeared to be recently re-decorated. Some of the reviews had mentioned that they heard the airport noise and people above and below but we did not find this to be the case at all. It was very quiet. We stayed the weekend before Thanksgiving and I had asked how full the hotel was and the desk person said it wasn't full. We had a wonderful time and enjoyed going for a jog along the bay in the morning. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and would definitely suggest the marina tower.

<Title>“Pleasantly surprised!”
<Content>Stayed there again last September for a conference. I was given a room in the Bay Tower this time, and was a little worried because of some not-so-good reviews. My room on the seventh floor was large, clean and had a great view of the Bay. I had large palm trees swaying back and forth right off my balcony, which made it a little more serene. Although I had to walk to and from the main hotel where the conference was taking place, I enjoyed the surroundings and peacefullness.

<Title>“Clean but noisy and shifty”
<Content>I stayed with my friend and toddler over Thanksgiving weekend. We were lucky to get a room in the newly renovated building. The room was clean and the view of the marina was nice. This hotel is very large and on this weekend was playing host to a lot of soccer teams. Kids were running up and down the halls until late at night. Apparently this hotel also allows them to stay in rooms without adults as we had the pleasure of rooming next to a few of them. When asked if they could keep it down we got knocks on our door with the subsequent sound of feet running away a few times. To get to our room we had to walk by the hot tub which, though large, was packed with teenagers every night. We didn't care to use it but if you do this may be important. My biggest concern was that upon my return home I discovered missing clothes from my luggage. Clothes that were packed in my suitcase the day before checkout but prior to the last room cleaning. I did not think to look through my luggage again on checkout day. The hotel couldn't do anything for me when contacted by phone and they did not respond to an email. I understand locking up your valuables when you travel but if a traveler has to worry about their clothes a hotel has a serious problem with its staff. Also, there is a $22/day parking fee. They do tell you this up front but in case you weren't paying attention to the details. All in all, no matter how clean the rooms are or how nice the view is (and that is not guaranteed) the stress of wondering when the kids are going to quiet down is just not worth it. And certainly not at the added cost of missing luggage.

<Title>“Make sure you get a bay view, and bring your own wireless”
<Content>I was lucky enough to get a bay view on the 11th floor, and it was amazing! The view, again, saved this hotel. The room was old, the TV was horrible, and there were less than 20 channels, (not counting the hotels 8 travel channels). As with most 4 or 5 star hotels, you get nickeled and dimed to death, parking costs, valet costs, wireless internets costs, and it's not cheap. My boss was traveling with me, and the valet actually lost his keys to the rental car. They did resolve the problem with the rental car company, but I still don't know if they actually found the keys.

<Title>“Snippy valet and front desk clerk”
<Content>The front desk clerk had an attitude. The valet was condescending and dismissive when I asked him when my car was going to be parked. It was just sitting there and was almost scratched by a big SUV. This occurred at the bay tower. The room had an excellent view of the bay but there is no insulation between floors and walls. You hear EVERYTHING from the people above and the neighbors next to you. This is not a place you would stay on vacation. It's convenient if you have a business event because you are minutes from the hotel. The sofa was dirty and stained.

<Title>“Great front desk staff. Great Location. Great View. Great Value.”
<Content>It's a little far from San Diego downtown, but the views (especially if you can swing a Bay View room) are gorgeous. We preferred staying at the Bay Tower instead of the Marina Tower because it gave us a small hotel feel. The Marina Tower is good if you want ambience for business meetings. Nice, clean, comfortable rooms and a super friendly staff made our stay great. Highly recommended. The one reason to take away any points is the over-priced parking. Sheraton needs to reconsider this unreasonable surcharge.

<Title>“Good value for money”
<Content>All in all a good value for money hotel. We had been travelling for 15 hours straight, so it very nice to know that the hotel was only minutes away. The downside is that you can hear aircrafts taking off from around 6:30am until late in the evening - but I do not think that there are many places in San Diego where you are unable to hear the aircrafts. That aside, the location is actually fantastic. Â½ hour stroll and you are in town. Excellent walking or running along the front of Harbor Island. Not too many other amenities, a couple of restaurants, hotels and some small shops. The hotel itself (Marina) was very nice. The room was an adequate size for the family. The extractor fan in the bathroom could be made a bit quieter though. Good amenities. Excellent room service meals. Good restaurant and even a Starbucks (if you like that sort of thing). Staff were very helpful. Swimming pool was a bit cold for my liking, but the jaccuzi made up for that.

<Title>“Good Priceline value, but not a 4 star hotel”
<Content>I was bracing myself after I booked this hotel through Priceline because reviews indicated that Priceline guest only get to stay in the Bay tower. I booked two rooms under different names and one of us was in the Marina and the other in Bay. When we pulled up to the Marina we asked the parking person which tower is better as we wanted to both be in the same tower. The reply was Bay since it is newer and bigger. We said okay and had the other room moved to Bay tower. The front desk said they upgraded us to a higher floor for the view, but the real reason was probably because the hotel was empty. Bay tower is nice, big rooms no prblems. Liked that they had free internet access and provded printers so print out boarding passes, Pool is just average, but since hotel empty it was like having a pool to yourself. I never made it to the Marina tower so I can't compare. But I do want to emphasize that this is not a 4 star hotel. Not sure who is rating it as such. Rooms need to be spotless and there is some wear and tear and dust in the corners. Bathroom needs to be bigger for a 4 star with more water pressure. The room is bigger than the average size room, but no newspaper every morning (automatically delivered) and no turn down service at night. So the most this hotel could be is a 3.5 star hotel. I paid $80 a night through Priceline so great price for a very decent room. Parking at $22 a night sucks since basically it is an empty lot with half the time no attendent, but that's San Diego or any major city! If lite sleeper than the airport nearby will wake you. But overall I would stay again if the price was right.

<Title>“Sheraton Marina needs to learn the meaning of customer service!”
<Content>My husband and I went to the Sheraton Marina to celebrate our anniversary. When making our reservation, I was told we could check-in as early as noon since the hotel was not full. We arrived at 3:00pm (1 hour before check-in time) and were told that our room was not quite ready yet. At 4:00 I went back to the desk to remind them we were waiting and they again said our room was not quite ready, but we could switch to a room with 2 smaller beds if we wanted. We finally were given the keys to our room at 5:00 after spending 2 hours waiting in and around the lobby! I wished they could have told us the room wouldn't be ready for 2 hours when we first arrived, and we would have left to do something fun. The next morning, I called the front desk to ask for a late check-out and was told that they could not do that. I reminded them that they kept us waiting when we checked in, and they said we could stay 30 minutes longer. I was very surprised that they didn't even give us coupons for a free drink at the bar to make up for our inconvenience. If they gave us a coupon for free breakfast, I would have been completely satisfied, and I wouldn't be writing this! Other than that, the room was nothing special, except that we had an amazing view of the nightly fireworks at Sea World. The breakfast buffet was delicious, but expensive. San Diego has so many lovely hotels that I don't know how the Sheraton will stay in business if they treat their customers this way!

<Title>“Wonderful Hotel, Very nice but $$$ Parking”
<Content>landed a room here for 2 nights from Priceline for $75/night...place was really nice, and i loved having the Starbucks inside...good news we were put on a high floor, with a Marina view but bad news is we got stuck w/ 2 double beds...of course that's to be expected when booking through Priceline, but my wife and I got over it. It was way nice for the price, so no complaints there. The rooms were very nice, but the room we had was somewhat small. Maybe if it was a king bed it would've felt roomier, but compared to our previous hotel it was a bit tight, but not bad for the 2 nights we were there. The hotels in a very convenient spot to the airport, and is somewhat centralized with the beaches just a few short miles away, and the zoo/downtown about the same distance in the other direction. The beds were VERY comfortable I will say. Out of the 3 hotels we stayed at during the week of our vacation, the beds here were our favorite. I gave this hotel a 4 out of 5 stars because: The 3 biggest downfalls for us was the cost of parking, no free Wi-Fi in the room, & no fridge...for $22/day you'd think you'd get valet, but no valet is $28/day. Itâ€™s really pointless to pay for valet when the valet parking lot is right beside the standard lot. I know paying to park is pretty standard in SD, but $22/day is just getting up there. You'd think for that kinda money to park they'd at least give you free Wi-Fi in the rooms, but only place you're getting it is downstairs. For us, using Skype and talking to family on the webcam is quite pointless downstairs in front of everyone! Lol Far as having no fridge, well, you get the mini bar area in the room which costs $$$$ plus it's not even cold so. Not to mention if you DID get caught putting anything in there, they charge a $25 cleaning fee. When traveling I always like having a fridge, but I bought a cooler I brought with me just incase I ran into a room w/o one.

<Title>“Best french fries at Quinns!”
<Content>Stayed two nights here for the DEMO tech conference in September. Room was mid-sized (if size is a priority, try the Sheraton Suites Symphony Hall) but very comfortable. The wired Internet cost $12 a nite and was on the slow side (maybe I'm spoiled with Verizon FIOs at home), which did impede my work. Amenities were great. Each of the two towers has its own, huge gym (very modern equipment) and pool. I had a burger and fries at the bar, Quinns, and I must say they were very good, esp. the fries (fat, creamy, semi-skinned wedges with just the right amount of seasoning). Location is pretty - right on the water near the airport and rental car places - and great if you want to spend a dirty weekend with a sig other and only occasionally emerge to take leisurely walks along the water. You do need to cab into downtown for a broad food selection, though.

<Title>“Very nice and convenient”
<Content>My colleague and I enjoyed our 4-night stay here. Right next to the airport, free shuttle, but no noises. We had very good view of the bay, airport and downtown. Coming from Boston, a walking city, San Diego is even better. Seaport village was great walk enjoying the Midway, artworks, marinas with expensive yatches, shopes and very good, romatic seafood restaurant. We walked the gaslamp quarter with restored architecture of the old buildings, restaurant-lined 4th, 5th & 6th streets sining while people watching. All these for $10 & $15 cab rides from the hotel. Sea world is also $15 cab ride away. Don't do the zoo, we were disappointed. We thought San Diego is whole lot better than LA, San Fran or Sacromento. The hotel Quinn sport restaurant served very good foods. I liked very much the Pacific seafood chowder, baby back ribs and grilled salmon. We were filled at full buffet breafast. Per the rating above, we had problems with the waiter at the Harbor edge restaurant for buffet breakfast. The man had attitude as if we shouldn't be eating any food at all. He acted as if he did not want to serve OJ and coffee. He served as he attempting to kick us out. It's a $21 breakfast buffet after all, not $5. We enjoyed the meal but did not come back for second breakfast.

<Title>“I was checked in someone else's room by mistake and entered while they were there.”
<Content>After entering an already occupied room with my children (that were worried entire trip if this would happen to us) we had to go down with the ONLY working elevator in that wing of the Marina Tower that took about 15-20 minutes. This time we were given another room. When we went up our key didn't work. While we were going down on the elevator we saw our luggages going down too. The bell boy said it's because he was given yet another wrong room number. After spending over an hour of going up and down finally we settled. The room was nice with a great view. However we were so tired of all this that basically we couldn't do much that day. Now I wouldn't be so upset if they offered something to make up for it however no such gesture was made. They did not even apologized properly. We stayed there numerous times for the convenience of water sports and the view. If I was managing this hotel I would do everything to make up for this sort of inconvenience, So great hotel with not very polite staff. Parking is very expensive. Also for a pet friendly hotel it is strange that she was not allowed at the very casual patio style restaurant by the pool. Because of this we could never dine with entire family. By the way the food was so bad (curry chicken) that I got sick to my stomach. At another trip my husband ended up having the same result with anothert dish. It was surprisingly quiet since it was by the Airport. However since our room was at the end of one wing. We either had to walk a long way to get the main elevators or wait for the only working elevator at our wing that wasted a good chunk of our trip.

<Content>After reading some of the reviews here I was very concerned because I had booked through Priceline. My experience was very different: I was given a deluxe room on the 9th floor of the Bay Tower, which seems to be better for leisure, more relaxed. The staff was great and all very helpful. I am glad I didn't cancel my reservation because I couldn't have asked for better at triple the rate. The only improvement I offered them was to arrange for a shuttle to downtown areas.

<Title>“Okay for couples but not families....”
<Content>The hotel was okay but not as great as some of the reviews I've read. First of all, no kids cable channels(Cartoon network, Nickelodeon, Disney) available which made the evenings a little boring for the little ones. Fortunately, we had a room on the seventh floor with a great view of the harbor and the swimming pool. The swimming pool is very nice and the pool area is relaxing. The food in the pool area is surprisingly good but a bit pricey. But hey, you're on vacation. Also, there wasn't an arcade room which my kids keep asking for. Again, not much for kids to do. The complaint I keep seeing is the Parking. Yes, it is expensive with $22/day for self parking or $28/day valet parking. I opted for the valet parking for the duration of my stay (5 Nights). I soon found out that the valet parking was costing me much more than $28/day with the constant and expected tipping whenever you need your car. If you wanna save, don't go this route since the self parking is a very short walk to the entrance. Overall, the hotel was okay. Didn't expect it to be so close (practically next door) to the airport. I would not stay here again when I cime back to San Diego.

<Title>“Do not stay in this terrible hotel!!!”
<Content>This hotel experience was absolutely terrible. We were staying in the Marina tower for a wedding at the hotel. Upon arrival we were put on the fourth floor, which is fine, however the room window faced a brick wall with very limited light and no view - this is fine for a business trip, but not for a vacation at a hotel that brands itself as a "hotel and marina". This was also the only room in the hotel with this view. I went down the the lobby to request a room change and the hotel staff said they would not change it. I asked to speak with a manager and the front desk manager, Lynne, told me that it is against their policy to change people's rooms regardless of reason. I was not asking for a better room, nor was I asking for a higher floor, simply another (equal) room on the same floor. She said that they had none available. That is fine, but there was no offer of another room on a different floor. I asked for the courtesy of being moved to a different floor and was told they would be happy to upgrade me at no fee however they had no king beds available on any other floor for the weekend. I found this hard to believe, so I came back again and asked if I could be upgraded to another room if I paid the difference - suddenly a room was available. This simply revealed a blatant lie by the hotel manager, Lynne, which I do not appreciate. When I pointed this out, she said that she could not accomidate me at the same rate. I very much wanted to enjoy my vacation so I agreed to pay the extra money to move, however when we went to the new room it smelled strongly of smoke (in a smoke free hotel). I asked to be moved again and was told no, and asked for it to be cleaned to get rid of the smell. They sent someone up, but it did not help and the smell did not go away all trip. Lastly, housekeeping did not come to make up the rooms until at least 5pm each day, which is when I called the desk and demanded someone be sent up to clean the room. As a person who spends more than 150 nights per year in hotels, the service and hospitality at this hotel is among the worst I have seen, and the hotel management, especially Lynne, is an embarrasment to the Starwood brand.

<Title>“Spectacular view”
<Content>Upon checked in, they gave us a traditional room wth a parking lot view even though we paid for a water view room through an online third party service. My spouse called CS then eventually went to the front desk & spoke with a manager. After an hour of "this & that," they transferred us to a different tower, and gave us a bigger room with a beautiful view of the bay & marina. We are very delighted. We don't have any complaint about the service since they brought our luggages to the new room, and the staff are friendly & helpful. The only set back was the parking which is $22.00 per night for self-parking & $28.00 for valet. And, also the beverages in the room were pricey, $5.00 for a small bottled water, and $7.00 for a bottle of Gatorade. My suggestion is bring your own beverages. And, most of all, spend a full day or two in Balboa Park. We will, for sure, next time we go back.

<Title>“Really comfortable, great deal, good food. Fab views”
<Content>I stayed here for two nights on a business trip and it was great. I was in meetings around town/ out of town all day, and the hotel was an oasis of calm at the beginning and end of the day. It is also easy to get to the main autoroutes, so great if you are out on the road. Not having to contend with the city centre traffic is a bonus if you are having meetings up at the science parks. The bed was uber comfortable and I think the best couple of nights sleep I had during the whole two week trip. The view was incredible, the boats, the beach, the sunshine. It was a great start to the day. My room was really comfortable with a nice fresh nautical feel to the decor. Makes a change from the usual corporate dull durge of a hotel chain. The room service was good - usual standard fare - I remember a particularly tasty hamburger! The bars had a good atmosphere and I felt quite comfortable sitting on the terrace of an evening reading my book. I did confuse the restaurant staff at breakfast however - they seemed to have no idea what a soft boiled egg was or how you would cook one. They did give it a couple of attempts though before they admitted that they had no idea what I was asking for. I used the gym/ fitness centre. Nice, new equipment, good entertainment system, nice spa etc. All the towels and robes are provided, as you would expect from a Sheraton, so you dont have to hike lots of stuff around. There's a courtesy shuttle bus to and from the airport, which is good I called through beofre hand to check where I would find it. I woud definitely recommend the place. True, I had a great rate from Expedia which helped and made it all the more attractive.

<Title>“Great way to end our summer”
<Content>We got a great rate for this hotel and stayed for 3 nights (August 9-12). We had a low floor room with a partial view of the pool. We initially started with a room facing the parking lot but after a quick stop at the desk, we were transferred on the other side with the pool view. The staff is friendly and corteous. Rooms were cleaned meticulously. Best thing about the hotel? starbucks in the lobby (for sleepless parents like us). We had a great time lounging around in the pool. They also have a great fitness facility with lots of activities for families. They rent out bikes, lend out ping pong rackets, a tennis court and everything you could possibly think of. I was able to use their spa service and had an excellent massage. They offer facials too and all services priced reasonably. Their spa is not really the type of spa that you go in to relax but it has more of the fitness club feel with showers and sauna. Hopefully they have a real spa lined up in the future. The only thing I could complain about is the Harbor's edge restaurant, for some reason, someone overlooked the fact that there are no ramps to get to the dining area. This restaurant is off of the main lobby of the hotel and only has steps to lead down to the tables. The hotel must have been aware of this oversite because all the staff are always kind enough to offer to lift the stroller for you. They also forgot to put down a ramp to access the main pool on the marina tower so you have to go around and take the elevator down. By the way, did i mention $22/day for parking? we didnt mind since it's like that pretty much anywhere in San Diego, for the rate that we got, it's still a deal. Other than that, it was a great stay and we will definitely be back.

<Title>“Can't Imagine Staying Here By Choice”
<Content>I used Priceline for two nights in San Diego at two different hotels. Got both for around $70, one at Hilton Gaslamp (which was GREAT) and one here. First, it has been noted in the reviews that they treat Priceline/Hotwire customers differently. I also found this to be true -- and I think it is a silly way to do business, since we are more likely (in my opinion) to go squawk about our experiences on the internet. But anyway... Yes, we were placed in the Bay Tower, which they called the West. We were on the fourth floor -- which was really the third -- and we overlooked the parking lot. Lovely. Yes, there was some water and city views beyond, but with the parking lot three floors below it is hard to enjoy. Tried to take a dip after check-in at 8:30 PM... all towels gone and the pool a bit murky. The room looked nice, but had a few issues. One, there was no information in the room about the hotel services, cost of internet, location of amenities -- nothing. We had to call to find out about all of these things. Do they charge for the coffee and tea? I still don't know. Though I do know that if you put personal items in the minifridge they will charge you a $25 cleaning fee. Really. Two, and I have not seen this mentioned here before, but the duvet, while attractive, weighed about two hundred pounds. The only way I can imagine sleeping with it would be if the room was ice cold --- which brings us to problem three. I set the air conditioner on the coldest possible setting and it was still relatively balmy in there. Could only sleep with a sheet, and it was very hard to sleep. Four, the toilets flush with incredible force, which is fine... but you also hear all the toilets flushing in all neighboring rooms. All night. Five, of course, the parking is a racket. The existence of this hotel would make me nervous to do Priceline for San Diego again. And finally, I didn't take it seriously, but the Bay Tower really is far, far away from the Marina tower. I think it is disingenuous for them to both be a part of the same hotel since they are so separate. It's misleading and, I think, borderline deceitful.

<Content>The American Society of Civil Engineers Pipeline Division annual meeting is being held here (since Saturday.) 527 registrants. Fire alarm and evacuation yesterday am about 10:00 am, all meeting rooms evacuated, scared hotel guests, etc. Then the fire alarm went off at 4:10 am this am (Tuesday 18th), about the time we had some clothes on they anounced "we have investigated there is no fire", then at 10:30 this am the fire alarm went off for the third time in two days, all meeting rooms evacuated, etc. technical presentations disrupted, Front desk is playing dumb, don't know anything, etc. We will NEVER stay at this hotal again. I can assure you!!! This is the Society's third San Diego meeting in the last twelve years, I doubt if the members will ever vote for THIS hotel again, my wife was terrified here on the 11th floor at 4 am. We are 75 and 76 years young and my wife could never make it down 11 flights of stairs, she is.afraid to go to sleep tonight on this 11th floor.

<Title>“Excellent Experience after some Tweaking”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina for three weeknights in July. We had an awesome experience but only after we did some tweaking of our room location. We booked through Hotwire at a rate of $114 and upon arriving at the Marina Tower (there are two towers - the Marina and the Bay - around the corner from each other) the valet politely informed us we were in the Bay Tower. After reading the previous reviews we expected this as it appears the Bay Tower is used for their Hotwire and Priceline customers. We arrived in the beautiful Bay lobby and were informed our "standard" room was either on the first floor in the back of the tower facing the marina or on the second floor in the front of the tower which was level with the parking lot. We choose to look at the first floor room and found a very large, very clean room with floor to ceiling windows that didn't open, a walkway right outside the windows and a beautiful view of the marina. The second story room, although we didn't go into the room, had a balcony but looked right onto the parking lot and then the bay. We didn't like the idea of feeling trapped with windows that didn't open, the lack of privacy with a walkway just outside the windows or staring at cars so we asked for a room higher up. We were informed we were only entitled to a first or second story room and that we'd need to pay $20 a night (plus taxes) to move up. We decided to upgrade and asked to be moved to the Marina tower. The Bay Tower's rooms are large, the pool is very nice, and there's free wi-fi in the lobby, a breakfast room and a business center. The two towers are about a 5 minute walk around the marina and is quite lovely. Perhaps in bad weather it would not be so pleasant. The Bay Tower is a lot quieter if that's what you are looking for. The Marina Tower is where the action is. Our Marina Tower room was on the 9th floor overlooking the pool and the marina. FABULOUS! The small balcony was wonderful and when we closed the sliding doors we could barely hear the airplanes. The room was large (not quite as large as the Bay Tower), very clean, beautifully decorated, and with a good sized bathroom. We enjoyed Happy Hour and a beautiful sunset at the Shoreline Restaurant next to the pool, then dinner at Quinn's, the pub that overlooks the pool and marina. The pub had decent prices and good food and wasn't dark like you'd expect a pub to be. There were two billiard tables for their customers to use. There are two pools in the Marina tower, the main one which is large and next to the Shoreline and the other is smaller and quieter. There are hamocks to relax on and rocking chairs around a fire pit. Harbor Island is flat so it's great for walking and running. I rented a bike one morning ($7 an hour, 4th hour free) and totally enjoyed riding along the water to the Star of India, USS Midway and Seaport Village. I felt very safe as I never had to be on the road with the cars and it only took 25 minutes to get to Seaport Village. The $20 upgrade was well worth it as we loved our room and the view it offered. The elevators were slow, in fact two of the days one of the elevators was being working on but we didn't mind much. We enjoyed the free US Today newspapers and the Starbucks coffee and tea in the rooms. Parking is $22 a night but it seems to be the going rate in the downtown area. We've stayed at other downtown hotels and have paid that amount and more to park. If you don't have a car taxis are readily available (at least at the Marina Tower, I'm not sure about the Bay Tower). Being right next to the airport would be very handy if you have an early morning flight as the Sheraton has a free shuttle, doesn't feel like an airport hotel and yet you are so close. The only negative thing I can say about the Sheraton was how they initially made us feel since we booked with Hotwire. My husband and I have booked a number of hotels through Hotwire and never before have we been made to feel "cheap" or told " . . because you booked through Hotwire . . ." Our past experience is that if a hotel has available rooms it will upgrade us at no charge and there's never any mention of who we booked through. It appears that Sheraton sets aside the least desirable rooms for their "cheap" customers, in fact the entire first floor of the Marina tower had different lighting and lower ceilings than the other halls. I think the only windows that don't open are those on the first floor on the Bay Tower so that's why they are given to the Hotwire and Priceline customers. All in all, a great experience and we will come back.

<Title>“Very comfortable with GREAT views!”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego for five days in July as a quick summer get-a-way - I do love this hotel because of the location by the marina and it has more of a resort feel. Being close to the airport was no issue at all - I did't hear any planes! Some say it's too far out but it's only a $8 - $10 cab ride to downtown... we had a rental for a few days though too. Room very nice - clean, modern, bright colors and the bed comfortable. We had a room up very high up facing the marina and overlooking the pool. We enjoyed nice sunset while sipping a beverage on the patio. They have a fabulous pool and hot tub and the food was great at the restaurants. We found Quinns to be somewhat "cold" in feel and atmosphere but the other restaurant was great!!! Plus, they have a huge Starbucks on site. We enjoyed some delicous tapa's one night as well sitting a the lobby bar over wine. We enjoyed out stay and would definately recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Title>“Nice place! Attempt to find a great deal using your "Entertainment Book"”
<Content>My husband and I traveled with another couple and their 6yr old son- stay was 7/16-7/19. Staff was courteous, and friendly upon check in- they also worked so that our rooms would be on the same floor, and near each other. Rooms were very clean, and well appointed- we booked a non-bayview room, that overlooked the parking lot. We called upon the concierges service both nights of our stay, recommendations for Pizza to be delivered, and Mexcian food out the other night. Pizza recommended was Ogi's- simple good pizza, with very efficient staff and very prompt delivery. Mexican Food Restaurant recommended was Miguel's Cocina, on Shelter Island Dr- we all enjoyed our meal, around $10 a plate, and a killer Jalapeno Cheese Dip.... needless to say the concierges desk did a great job. The pool was very nice; although there were some great "fire pit" seating areas along the walkway that looked like a great place to sit and watch the sun go down...they were always full... a very popular spot. :o) The only complaint that we did have is the following: Our room was on the 3rd floor, and there were two elevators, of which only ONE WAS OPERATIONAL THE ENTIRE STAY. We waited OVER 20 MINUTES to get on the elevator, when we were trying to check out the morning of our departure. (We had entirely too many bags to be lugging down the stairs.) We'd overheard a conversation during our stay, from a fellow guest of the hotel, that they'd been there since Tuesday and only ONE elevator had been operational during their stay as well...that was a total of 5 days, of which we were aware of. We did advise the front desk staff, and a "Manager" on duty of the elevator issue- they said they'd look into it....(short for that's nice, go away...) I'm grateful that all the guests in our group were able-bodied, and could handle taking the stairs the other two days of our stay... Overall, a great place to stay, friendly staff, and centrally located to many attactions. :) IF YOU STAY IN THE MARINA TOWER ON THE 3RD FLOOR, MAKE SURE TO INQUIRE IF BOTH ELEVATORS ARE WORKING. :O) **ALSO, BEWARE OF THE PARKING FEE- $22 PER NIGHT FOR SELF PARKING, AND $28 A NIGHT FOR VALET.**

We got an $80 rate via priceline. If your there for the 4th of July it cant be beat, FRONT ROW SEATS! The pool was great. My biggest complaint was the out of this world parking fee of $22 per night. Prices for room service and the pub were pricey.

<Title>“Great Hotel on the Marina”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina and enjoyed my stay. I attended a conference in one of the two hotel towers. The rooms were comfortable and had a great view of the Marina and the pool area. The walk in the morning from the tower we stayed at to the one the conference was in was short and was along a beautiful walkway right by all the yachts. The only problem is that it was far from everything and would require a taxi. I took a taxi on one of the days and stoped by the pier to catch the double decker bus for a tour around town, that was fun and very informative!

<Title>“Nice Hotel but Not a Good Location for the Leisure Traveler”
<Content>Although we are San Diego locals, we'll occasionally spend a night downtown and play tourist. We use Priceline to save money and always get right downtown Gaslamp - until now. This time our bid "won" the Sheraton Harbor Island. For our purposes, it couldn't have been a worse location. Not only were we not within walking distance of anything but we had no public transportation options other than a taxi at $25-30 round trip to the Gaslamp. As an added pleasure the hotel charges a $22 to self park. A great example of going broke saving money. Having said that the hotel would be great for the business traveler who just needs an over night stay or has an early morning flight. We stayed in the Bay Tower and our room was clean and nicely updated. We had a harbor facing room which is also the side of the airport. I was concerned the flight noise would be a problem but it really wasn't. I will say though that the toilets flush with such force they could wake the dead! Upon checkin we attempted to get the Marina Tower as it is clearly the better tower in terms of things to do within the hotel but the Front Desk Clerk would have none of that. To her defense, they were full with a teacher's convention but she could have handled our request in a better manner. The Bay tower does have its own pool and fitness center both of which we took advantage. We hit the pool around 4:30pm - the pool attendent was gone as were all the pool towels. The fitness center was capable - the equipment was fairly new and there was enough variety to get in a decent cardio or weight workout. Would like to recognize the Valet attendent who took care of us when we were looking for cheaper parking options. We told him we were not going to park in the hotel and would move the car somewhere else after checkin. After getting settled, we went back down to get the car and he moved it to a free spot that opened up directly across the street. Nice Service!

<Title>“Loved our stay...”
<Content>My husband and I were celebrating our one year anniversary in San Diego and based on reviews on various sites, we decided to stay at the Sheraton San Diego and Marina Hotel. When making our reservation, we let them know we were celebrating our one year anniversary and hoped to get a room in the Marina Tower with a nice view of the marina. Our check-in attendant was kind enough to go above and beyond our request and provided us with a townhouse in the Lanai area which is connected to the Marina Tower. We were SO happy with our stay here. We had a beautiful marina view, the staff was excellent, and the restaurants were great. We enjoyed our stay so much that we did not hesitate to book another night at this hotel after our flight was canceled. It is conveniently located close to the airport and is a short drive to many tourist attractions. Love, love, loved this hotel! Highly recommend!

<Title>“Fine with a special rate - not convinced worth paying more”
<Content>I stayed a night in the Bay Tower, which seemed to be poor relation in terms of facilities, but was quite OK. I had a pre-paid rate of around $100 and would've been disappointed had I paid more or had had to pay for parking, a better view (mine was fine though, from 4th floor across the bay, from a wide balcony) and the other add-ons (see other reviews on this unsavoury aspect). The TV includes Showtime, but a very limited range of other cable channels (presumably to encourage guests to pay for their own movies etc). The room decor was superb - modern red-white-n-blue paintings; long sofa and expansive desk; footstools and coffee table. If anything, there was too much furniture in the room, but the bed positioned on a corner was definitely an interesting feature and helped give the room a different feel. A stray face-cloth from a previous guest and a faulty constantly-flashing message light on the phone [which the front desk tried but failed to correct, and then failed to follow-up with maintenance] were aspects that would have annoyed me had I been paying full rate, as would the absence of a Guest Services Guide (the tv-based version being unavailable). The ground floor pool was disappointing, failing to take advange of the hotel's position on the bay [it could've been anywhere in any city] and the pool area wasn't kept clean.

<Content>The location is convenient and the staff are nice enough. Note that parking is around $20 a day. The nautical decor is very clean an fresh and suites the destination well. A couple issues worth mentioning: there was an unpleasant smell in the hallways... Not sure if it's what they use to clean the carpets or something else. Also, there was only one elevator in operation for my wing of the hotel. It sometimes took 15 minutes to get down to the lobby do to this fact. The hot tub was not hot in the morning... Definitely less than 100F. I would stay again but only with a nice discount.

<Title>“Nice hotel - but room rate is just the beginning”
<Content>The room at this hotel was nice, and the price was right using their pre-paid rate. But that was just the beginning of the costs of staying there. Right off the bat there was a $22 a day rate for self parking. Once inside, I felt like they did everything they could to nickel and dime you. The room has the mini bars where as soon as something is picked up, you get charged for it. Don't want to pay for the mini bar? There's a vending machine where everything from a pack of skittles to a snack bag of Doritos is $1.50. Want to buy your own snacks? No problem - except if you want to keep anything cold. If you remove the items from the mini bar, it's a $24 fee for "restocking". Want to use the internet in the room? No problem - but it'll cost you. Want to get off the ground floor? No problem - for an extra $25 a night. Don't want a room facing the airport? That's $20 a night. I have stayed at really high-end hotels and never felt as nickeled and dimed as I did here. I also found that the ceiling was not very sound-absorbing and we could hear everything going on upstairs.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel---- great location”
<Content>My husband and I went out to San Diego for a week for R&R before he started a new job. This hotel was excellent.. The rooms were very clean and service was exceptional . The staff from the Pool waiter (Rob) to the Breakfast omelet man(Horatio) where very friendly and helpful. The fire pit at night by the bay was very relaxing with a glass of wine. I used the fitness center three times and everything worked and was in excellent condition.We ended up touring every morning, it is only a 10 minute ride to the zoo, old town, mission and ocean beaches, gaslamp,and sea world. We also hiked at Torey pine state park and visited La Joella . One day we drove to the dessert and hiked Palm oasis canyon hike and hike at state park in the mountains where the Ceder fire was still very evident.. The hotel was so centrally located to everything. The only thing we didn't do was go to Mexico.. They said it was too dangerous there for Americans. I would highly recommend this hotel.. now it's back to work in Pittsburgh... It was JUNE GLUME in San Diego but we had a great time.

<Title>“Great Hotel, Great Stay, Highly recommend.”
<Content>Hotel was much more than we expected. Bay Tower is a 5 min walk from main hotel, but rooms are 33% bigger. Our room looked out over the water towards Coronado Bridge, Staff was awesome, everybody very nice and accomadating. Quinns had great food. Hotel was close to all fun things in San Diego. 3 Swimming pools, hammocks, Bar service at pool, computer station, My son played X box in the lobby. We had a great time and will stay there again.

<Title>“Couldn't have had a better stay”
<Content>We visited the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina for the second time (June 20 - 24) and stayed in one of the charming Junior Suites in the Bay Tower. We had a wonderful direct view of the bay and all rooms in this tower come with a balcony and view of either the bay or the Marina. We consistently found the rooms to be maintained well, kept clean, the staff polite, friendly and very accomodating to special requests. This was our wedding anniversary and the Management Staff made it a special event. Now, iff the weather had just been as nice as hotel, this would have been the perfect visit. Be prepared to pay for parking.

<Title>“Request the MARINA tower!! BAY tower = no amenities!!!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton San Diego last weekend (June 5-7, 2009) and thought it was great. First, let me explain to you that they have two "towers" the Bay tower and the Marina tower. The towers are actually two separate hotels connected by an outside walkway. It takes about 5 minutes to walk from one to the other. The Marina hotel is DEFINITELY the nicer hotel and has all the amenities. Second, the hotels are very close to the airport and offer a FREE SHUTTLE to and from the airport. We did not rent a car the entire trip. We were given a room in the BAY tower (so for the purpose of this review, I will be grading the Bay tower), which was nice, but there were no amenities. We were notified at check-in that the pool and hot tub in the Bay tower would be closed until June 14 at least, but that we could walk over to the Marina hotel and use that pool. The room was nice...it had a nautical-themed decor. We had an excellent view of the marina and all the boats out our patio door. The comforter was down or something like that, but it made crinkly noises when you moved or rolled over. Also, there was no public computer to use, again that was located in the Marina tower. We had to go over there to check e-mail because we didn't bring our laptop. I think the Bay tower had wireless internet if you have your laptop with you. The spa and fitness center were also located in the Marina tower along with bicycle rentals and various other activities. The location was great though. There is a shuttle pick up near the hotel that can take you to Sea Port Village for the Trolley tour. We actually walked the 3 miles to Sea Port Village because the weather was nice (or you can rent bikes from the Marina tower). Overall the Bay tower was nice because we didnâ€™t mind walking over the Marina tower, but in the future I will be sure to stay in the Marina tower.

<Title>“Nice place, near the airport”
<Content>Stayed here for 2 nights to end our California vacation. Staff was very friendly. I requested an early check-in, and also requested the Marina tower (thanks to tips from TripAdvisor). Both were granted immediately with no questions or hassles. The Marina tower is definitely the place to be ... restaurant and nicer pool are there, although I did hear others say the Bay tower rooms are larger. Our room was about what we expected ... very clean with a great view of the pool and Marina. The beds were a little smaller than what we're used to however. My kids loved the large pool and hottub ... the pool is much larger and nicer than I would normally expcect at a hotel. It was cool during our stay, so the outdoor heating kiosks in the pool area were also nice. The hotel is also very near the airport. I returned my rental car the night before we checked out. The airport car rental return is literally across the street ... I walked about a quarter mile back to the hotel. The only negatives to this place are the cost of parking ($22/night) and the prices at the restaurant. The breakfast buffet was $22 for adults and $10 for kids. The only other place to eat within walking distance is a small cafe between the towers next to the marina, and they only serve breakfast and lunch. Also, no frig or microwave in the room, so it's difficult to bring your own food. Overall, however, this was a very nice hotel.

<Title>“Great hotel with great price”
<Content>I stayed here recently for a week long conference at the Convention Center. I also brought along my 3 yr old son and a girlfriend. We all found this hotel to be perfectly suited to our needs. We were in the Lanai Tower, which I know many have criticized. We were more than pleased with it. Honestly, the ONLY drawback was the condition of the carpet outside in the halls...but come on, what do you expect when it's open to the elements? Our room had recently been re-done (it was evident) and it was immaculately clean--I'm a complete germaphobe, so this should carry some weight. We also had access to a separate pool and hot-tub, which we all used and enjoyed a lot. As far as getting around was concerned, we did rent a car for the week so that we could visit San Diego attractions, such as the zoo and Sea World. Although $22 a day for parking sounds steep, it really isn't, considering it's $10 an HOUR in most San Diego locations. And a shuttle came promptly to the hotel every morning to go to the Convention Center, so that was super convenient, as well. Would definitely recommend this hotel to a business traveler (nice lobby internet/computer hub, too) or a family traveling with young children. Very, very pleased!

<Title>“Convenient for an early morning flight”
<Content>I got a room upgrade at the time of check-in. Our reservation was for the Marina Tower, lower floor, balcony, with limited view. the room we were given was on the 10th floor, facing the marina, a pretty view. we stayed only one night, mainly because we had a 6:35am flight. The hotel provides shuttle service to the airport that starts at 5am. It was a bit rushed for us, traveling with two young children. The room was nice, bright, and cozy. my main complaint, and unfortunately it would cause us not to stay again is that the blanket is made of some material that you can hear when the person's moving, and my kids' did a lot of tossing and turning, so i didn't get a good night's rest. We had dinner on site, forgot the name of it, it's the casual one. the food was good, so was the service. Even though the hotel is right next to the airport, we didn't hear anything from take-off or landing.

<Title>“Great deal”
<Content>My mother and I stayed in this hotel for one night and I was pleasantly surprised by it. We stayed in a double-bed room in the bay tower (it's really a separate hotel you drive down the road to) and had a great view of the marina. The room was just as it looks on the website, the beds were comfortable, and everything was clean. The only downside was the bathroom: the tub was peeling, the towels were rough and worn out, and the floor was in need of repair. But considering we only paid $99 (plus tax and $22 for parking), I couldn't care less. The airport is directly across from the hotel, but the noise didn't bother us at all. This hotel is a great deal and a short drive from downtown.

<Title>“Bad Customer Experience from Booking Rep”
<Content>I haven't stayed here yet but I decided to book elsewhere because of the bad experience from a booking representative at the hotel (Dena Crump). On the spg.com website, they advertised they will match the price +10% off if their price is higher than somewhere else. I had found a lower price on Expedia and was able to get this deal for a Club Room from spg. However, when I tried to book 2 more Club rooms Dena refused to honor this price, stating that the price on the web site is $99 for a basic room, the price for the Club Room is $50 more, which is the same as the price on Expedia. I repeatedly told her that spg.com states a price of $209 for the Club Room, it doesn't state $99 + $50 for the Club Room. She refused to acknowledge the price posted online. I could have booked the rooms on spg.com and appeal to spg for a price match but I was fed up with this booking representative that I decided to just cancel and went somewhere else.

<Title>“Great Views, close to Airport”
<Content>This hotel is practically in walking distance to the San Diego Airport. The views from some rooms are great, but other rooms have no view at all. To get to some of the rooms requires a long walk and you'll need your key to get back into the hotel. Food is only fair, but staff is courteous. $12 per day charge to park your car.

<Title>“Relaxing Stay!”
<Content>I stayed in the Bay Tower for one night, booked by a travel agent for a conference I was attending. I really enjoyed my stay. I arrived at around 10 AM due to an early flight having worked through the night before boarding the plane. I was planning on just checking my bags and going out to explore the city. Amazingly, they had a room available and I was laying in the bed within minutes of arriving. It was great to spend the day resting. The room does have an interesting layout but it works well. Room feels spacious and was quite clean. One of the unique aspects is that each room has a balcony. Mine faced the marina and airport but I still appreciated the fresh air and sunlight. Loved the pool with the best aspect being that some of the lounge areas are semi-covered in case you do not want a lot of sun. I was able to comfortably nap by the pool without fear of burning myself. It is only a mile or so from the airport but I was not bothered by any noise even though my room faced the airport. If you are a light sleeper, it may be an issue for you. Try asking for a room facing the harbor. This location is not ideal for tourist activity. It is about a $15-20 cab ride to the Gas Lamp District if that gives you an idea. The staff were very friendly and eager to please. They were readily available with dining or entertainment options. I had a great stay at this location and would consider staying there again. However, if I was in San Diego to have fun and see the sights, I might find something a little closer to the action.

<Title>“Staff were disappointing”
<Content>The Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina, is a beautiful place. However, we were very let down by the staff. We checked in late, after earlier ringing them to say that we would be late. Our booking had been made over the internet and on our arrival at San Diego train station we took a taxi to the address on our internet booking reference. This took us to the main hotel close to the Marina. We were ignored by the staff when we rang the bell for service, even though we could hear them saying that they could see that people were at the desk (this is around 1am). We then got told off by the women who greeted us telling is that our booking was for the "Bay tower" hotel not the marina side and that we should have gone to the other hotel. We explained that we had come to the address that we had been provided by the internet booking agency, and she said "well they wouldn't know what room we have put you in" (not very helpful). She did check us in and give us what she said was a great room on the 11th floor of the bay tower. We ended up having to walk to the bay tower (about 6mins around the Marina - not a big deal but rather inconvenient at that time in the morning). Our room was great it had an excellent view of the Marina and provided everything it said it would. The only thing was that it didnt appear to have used recently and we can only assume hadnt been cleaned (dusted and the like) because of that. The drinking glasses were dirty and the above the shower had some mould. (These were both rectified the next day before we had a chance to talk to the staff about them.) We had further disappointing experiences with the staff when we tried to print out our tickets for a tour that we were to do that day, their printer wouldnt work, at the business centre. We asked if it was possible to get the front desk to print the tickets and were told that as we could have booked the tickets through them they wouldn't print them out because we didnt use them to get the tickets. But were were told that they would happily provide us with tickets themselves, if we paid for them again. We also used the pool while we were there - this was great - however once there were know towels left by the pool, so we asked for some and were told that "its not my job, try the gym" after wandering around to get to the gym there were no full size towel provided there only hand towels. The staff could not have cared less.

<Title>“OK Room, Great Club Perks”
<Content>I've stayed at this Sheraton a few other times all in the Marina Tower, after a large charity event I coordinated in May of 2007 and again in May of 2008. The first room I stayed in was a Marina tower deluxe room with a great view of the marina. That was my favorite of the 3 I have been in, especially after the long night before. It was great sitting out on the balcony with a cup of coffee. Stay 2 was a also a deluxe room, and just as nice, although the view of the parking lot wasn't as nice as that of the marina. If you are staying for leisure, I recommend paying the extra for a marina view. I think it's worth it. During stay 3, we were given a club room, but ironically I enjoyed the deluxe rooms better. We originally reserved a king deluxe, but upon arrival were told we were upgraded to a club room. However, they gave us a double bed room. I just think it's strange having an extra, empty bed there. They must have been remodeling as well, which I hadn't seen any signs of in my previous stays. They were redoing the wallpaper on the floor we were on, which is fine, but there weren't any "pardon our mess signs" or taped off areas, so it just looked a little shabby, unlike the rest of the hotel. We did get a chance to have breakfast in the club lounge and that was fantastic. The lounge is beautiful and the breakfast was nice, albeit it being a hyped up continental breakfast. Overall, I've been pretty happy with Sheraton hotels. I recommend getting room service and ordering their seafood melt sandwhich. mmmm. This particular hotel has great catering and an executive chef, and I have been pleased with the large scale events I have held there as well. The staff are very courteous and attentive. Oh, and it's GREAT having a starbucks in the hotel as well. :) I'm hoping next time I have a chance to enjoy the hotel's other amenities.

<Title>“Nice relaxing stay near San Diego airport”
<Content>I stayed overnight at the Sheraton Bay Tower (the smaller Sheraton) which is about a 7 minute walk from the Sheraton Marina. I took the convenient shuttle from the airport which was literally just a 5 min drive to the hotel. The shuttle runs approx every 25 mins. I stayed in room 917, which was a King size room with a large balcony. The room had a pleasant nautical theme with reds, blues and white. The bed was very comfy with white paneling around the bed. The room was outfitted with a sofa and armchair, a table/desk with two cushioned chairs. The minibar was one of those annoying electronic sensor types. There were small touches; grey marble counter tops in the bathroom and leather pulls on the dresser drawers that gave the room a luxurious feel. The balcony looked over the Navy base across the water with downtown San Diego in the distance. The only problem I had with the hotel was that I could hear the toilet flushing from the rooms above and beside mine, granted the toilets had a powerful flush. I noticed a large number of airline crew were staying at the hotel. This was my first time at a Sheraton and I would say itâ€™s comparable to a Hilton but not as nice a Hyatt (which I normally stay). I did enjoy the in-room Starbucks coffee and tea selection. Although I did not try, the hotel did not seem accessible by public transport. I took a quick $12 cab ride to San Diego downtown. Overall, I enjoyed the stay and would recommend this hotel to everyone.

<Title>“Couldn't believe our luck”
<Content>We flew in from the UK to LAX then drove down to San Diego, it took about 23 hours so we weren't impressed when the check-in guy told us we were not going to be in the main building but had to go to the Bay Towers (we had lots of luggage and very tired kids at 4 and 12), but it was the first time I'd booked on Hotwire so wasn't sure what to expect at $90 a night, he told us we had a nice room on the 12th floor with a good view so we repacked the car and drove the short drive to the correct building, we headed striaght for the elevator and were a little surprised to not see a button marked "12", just 1 thru 11 and "P" which we imagined to stand for parking, but we pressed it anyway and were astonished the doors opened on the penthouse level and our "room with a good view" turned out to be the Sunset Suite with a private roof terrace that was even bigger than the room. We could not fault the hotel in anyway, the staff were friendly and enormously helpful and the pool and fitness room were excellent, and all for 90 dollars a night, congratulations Sheraton and god bless Hotwire...

<Title>“Two Hotels in One.”
<Content>All the action, including the fancy pool, the restaurants, the bar, the starbucks, the concierge are in the main hotel. If you are bringing kids or want a lively scene, you must get into the Marina side. 300 yards away is the bay side, which is quiet. Small pool, small fitness room, small gift shop, small lobby, no crowds. I personally liked being able to work out or swim by myself, but it is a matter of personal preference. (And it is not that big of a deal to walk to the main hotel, esp. in San Diego weather.) The food in Quinn's, the hotel bar and pub, was outstanding.

<Title>“Hotel Was Great, Easily Surpassed Expectations Based on Prior Mixed Reviews”
<Content>My girlfriend and I spent 6 nights at this Sheraton property for a conference downtown. The reviews were mixed so we weren't sure what to expect. However, after spending nearly a week there, we had nothing to complain about whatsoever and really enjoyed our stay. First, I'll address the negatives from other reviews. We found the staff to be very friendly. The concierge was very helpful, the front desk upgraded us to a 9th floor marina view even though we got a great deal via a Priceline bid. The restaurant staff was solid too. (Scott, the bartender at the lobby (Tapatini) bar was excellent). Even the housekeeping staff was friendly and had smiles on their faces. The airport noise did not bother us. When we had the balcony door open we heard a few planes during our stay, but not too many and it wasn't that loud. Unless you plan on staying on the property all day, this really shouldn't be an issue. The hotel is right by the airport, so it is not as central to attractions as it could be. We knew this going in and planned on using cabs to get downtown (both for our conference and to eat in the Gaslamp District and check out Seaport Village). The parking rates are high (more than $20/night), so we figured a 10 minute cab ride downtown (about $10)would be worth it and it was. There is a cab stand at the hotel and that way you don't have to worry about parking, etc. We did stay in the main (Marina) tower. The Bay tower is about a 5 minute walk down the marina, so I can understand why people staying there would be a bit inconvenienced, as the main restaurants are in the Marina tower. About two-thirds of the rooms are in the main tower. The hotel was renovated in late 2008 and it really looks great, inside and out. We had a great stay. While the Bay tower might be too far away for some (the PapaNani's deli is a hidden gem for good casual/cheaper food and snack and is located on the path between the towers), the other complaints about this property seemed unfair, at least based on our 6-night stay there. We would definitely come back, even if we had a car and had to pay $20-$25 a night to park it (we are talking about San Diego after all, parking is never cheap in places like that).

<Title>“Comic Con 2007”
<Content>I spent 4 nights at this hotel as part of Comic Con 2007 (Comic Con is a citywide conference which pretty much sells out every hotel room in the San Diego area.) Upon arrival parking was relatively easy to find as it is adjacent to the hotel BUT the parking lot was full, so once we found a parking spot, we went through the nearest hotel entrance we could find and it was a very long TIRING walk to the front desk. The front desk staff was very courteous and cordial and check-in was speedy. We were checked into a room in the Marina Tower (the main tower) and we were VERY disappointed. We had requested a room with a King bed but were checked into one with two beds instead. The room was very basic and it was quite noisy, as well. IF we had stayed in this room for the duration of our stay, I would have been thoroughly dissapointed. The following morning we received a call from the Front Desk stating that if we desired we could move to a room in the Bay Tower. We packed up our things, drove to the other Tower (it IS necessary to drive between the Towers...too far to walk) and boy, were we pleased. The Bay tower has quite the resort feel to it and it is adjacent to the Marina (not sure about the Marina Tower as our room there faced the main street) The lobby was very elegantly decorated and the rooms were very large and cozy and were decorated in a tasteful nautical theme. It was much quieter in this Tower and the vibe was much more laid-back than it was at the main tower. They should be two different hotels!! My advice: Stay at the Bay Tower unless you are there overnight on a layover and only care about the bed... Also for those attending Comic-Con, this hotel is located at a very good location. The Comic-Con trolly makes pickups right outside the main entrance, and the Comic- Con room rate was very reasonable, as well. All in all, I would stay here again (but only in the Bay Tower!! :) )

<Title>“Great location and hotel!”
<Content>We really enjoyed are stay at the Sheraton. We got a great deal though. I don't know that I'd want to pay $200 a night, plus parking and internet though. We stayed in the Bay Tower. It is like another hotel, seperate from the Marina Tower, and has it's own check-in desk. There is quite a bit of distance between the 2 of them. The bay tower is smaller than the marina tower. There was plenty of parking at the Bay Tower, and it was $22 a day, or $28 for valet. The room was nice enough, and we had a great view of the bay, downtown, and Coronado Island. I would say this tower has a better view. The beds were comfy, and they had lots of comfy pillows too. The bathroom was small, but the shower worked well. Towels were not the best. The internet was $11.95 a day, and it was on the slow side. The mini-bar is expensive and if you move something in it, you will be charged, although they did take the charge off my bill, with no problem. Being close to the airport, I did not hear the airplanes at all.

<Title>“Nice view for airport hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed for one night post cruise and were pleased for the one night with a Priceline pick. We needed a place close to cruise terminal, airport and with a nice pool and the hotel filled the bill. It is out of the way for exploring San Diego. We did not have a car, parking cost were not an issue, and a machine for printing the boarding passes for next morning's flight is in the lobby, as are computers that are availabel free of charge of 45 minuits. Came in handy. The pool is very nice, but cement is falling and towels are had in the fitness room. We had fun later the afternoon watching the ship sail by for it s next cruise. Used the balcony a lot, it had chairs

<Title>“wouldn't stay again”
<Content>Very close to airport which was helpful. Checked in at Marina Tower. Young guys standing around that let customers also stand around. Room in Bay Tower which feels like staying at a budget hotel. Scratchy old generic white bath towels. Only enough for one shower (one set each). Nice bath products. Bathroom clean but so crowded. Small bathtub. I did like the bed and there were lots of pillows. View of the marina which was nice. We didn't mind the airport noise because we are pilots of a small plane, but it was frequent and loud. Not sure a non-pilot would be happy with that. No WiFi in the tower. Had to use an ethernet cable with my laptop. $12/day for internet that is slow. Couldn't watch internet videos because connection so slow. That really annoyed me. Restaurants had pretty good food but average service. Overpriced for what you get. Either lunch or dinner always $45 or more without liquor. Conference facilities fine. Long walk between the two towers which is nice for the most part. I will be back in SD for another conference in Oct. and will not plan to stay here.

<Title>“Very Happy”
<Content>I got the room through Hotwire for about over $100 a night. I was a little concerned before the stay due to some pretty iffy reviews on Tripadvisor, but my wife and I both came away very happy. The rooms are very clean and brightly decorated. Someone commented how the color scheme gave her a headache, but I liked the bright blue nautical theme and it fit well with the hotel. We liked the location. The views are great, it's close to the airport and all the major attractions, and there's a walking/jogging trail right outside. Of note, there's FREE internet available in the lobby. They don't seem to advertise it, probably because they want you to pay for it in the room, but it's there. The only negative, which is probably true of all the major hotels in the city, is the outrageous $22 per day parking fee.

<Title>“Adequate”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel for a meeting. The room and the facilities are nice. Be aware though that the hotel has 2 towers and they are NOT close to one another so if you are staying for a meeting ask to be in the tower where the meeting rooms are ( I believe it's the Marina tower). As far as airport noise I didn't hear it. I walked from the hotel to downtown, it's a 45 mins easy walk, there is a nice sidewalk that goes all round the bay, lots of people jogging and riding bikes so pretty safe. Didnt eat at the restaurants or used the pool, but my room was right in front of the pool and looked nice. You can walk to the hotel from the airport, it's right in front of it, 5 min walk. I didn't have any luggage with me so had no problem, but the hotel provides a free shuttle back and forth from the airport, but again it's extremely easy to get to it just by following the sidewalk.

<Title>“Our Family truely enjoyed this hotel”
<Content>We live in Vegas and love checking out the hotels here for a night away. This time we went to san diego for a 5 day extended weekend. The hotel is very nice, and we loved the view. The staff was very nice, and there response to our requests were unbelievably quick. We were disapointed that the hotel we stayed in was actually around the corner and down the road from the pics that we reviewed on their site. Also, my husband became ill and we had to check out on the 15th instead of the 16th. When I went to the desk to check out at 8:30 am I didn't ask for a refund since we had pre paid thru the 16th, instead I was informed that I would be charged 100.00 for early check out. They had the room paid for through the next day and they still charged us 100.00. above that to check out early. I know I am repeating my self here, and I did with them too. they just explained that it was only a hundred dollars. So if you stay and pay ahead of time for the stay, don't check out early. Other than this we love this hotel, and it centrally located to lots of family fun things to do!

<Title>“Very nice hotel, but service levels going down”
<Content>The rooms at this hotel have recently been renovated, and are quite nice. The location across from the San Diego Airport is very convenient, and it is a 10-minute ride to downtown, the Gaslamp District, and to the Convention Center. Also a great location if you are visiting the Navy facilities on Pt. Loma. I have stayed at the hotel a number of times over the past 12 months, and generally have had a very positive experience. The exercise room is terrific based on the facilities found in most hotels. There has, however, been a distinct downgrade in the level of service provided. Specifically, the restaurant no longer offers menu service for breakfast - it is buffet only. The buffet is probably better than average, but it is getting a bit pricey at $21.00 per person. We gave up the convenience and went elsewhere for the ability to order off the menu, and at least attempt to stay within our per diem limits. The hotel has also discontinued the newspaper service, so no more USA Today at the door when you get up. To be fair, free copies of newspapers are made available in the lobby area, but you are out of luck if you like to have a cup of coffee and browse he paper in your pajamas in the morning. I also did not receive a bill under my door at the end of my stay. This may be because it would not fit under the door with the new carpet in the room, or it may be an additional cutback in service. It was unclear to me which. Parking is also getting pricey - $22.00 per day to park your rental (or personal) car. The soundproofing is good. Aircraft departing were not terribly noticeable.

<Title>“The Good, the bad and the ugly”
<Content>Stayed here for a work conference. I was in one tower, my co-worker in the other. We immediately compared rooms. The good: I enjoyed my room in the Bay Tower. Huge comfy bed. The bed was at a strange angle in the room, but it worked. Adequate bathroom. (loved the full size hairdryer.. didnt get to use it tho, since I brought my own) The shampoo/conditioner and body lotion was nice and stocked daily. The balcony to the marina was beautiful.. but bird poop on the railings and chair (i did not sit outside) The airport noise did not bother me at all. Work conference had sessions posted in both towers... so lots of walking (short 3-4 min walk) was nice. In between the two towers was an amazing little deli/store called Papa Nani's. Lifesaver to those on a budget! They offered breakfast, lunch (hot and cold sandwiches) and assortment of salads in addition to sodas/juices/beer, snacks and small toiletry items. Wonderful and friendly staff. They even popped popcorn in their microwave for you to take back to your room! The hotel shuttles were fast and friendly drivers. And the main lobby (marina tower) had a pleasant smell that reminded me of Hollister store - but not overkill. There was even lemonade available when we checked in . The bad: No fridge and no microwave. There was a mini-bar but I did not dare touch anything inside (outrageous prices) There were no vending machines but an overpriced gift shop was available. The solution? PapaNani's (see above) The Ugly: The internet in the business center went down on my final night (friday.) I could not check airport schedules or email family or work. Front desk responded by saying, "IT went home at 5, they'll be back monday morning." So basically internet down all weekend? The front desk staff did offer to check on airport schedule for me. And there was a computer in lobby which allowed for guests to print their airline boarding passes. Overall, my stay was a great one. I did not have access to a car, but you can take free shuttle to airport to board the city bus #992 (i recommend a $5 all day pass) and make as many transfers as you like to get to where you want to go. The concierge was helpful in helping me get to Coronado for the afternoon. I did not eat at hotel.. since conference provided some meals..but for snacks I definitely recommend Papa Nani's deli. Thanks for a great stay!

<Title>“Bad location, def NOT 4*”
<Content>We got 2 rooms from Priceline. Since PL group downtown and harbor island together, we got this hotel which is on the harbor island, middle of no where. If you're looking for a downtown SD hotel, don't book thru PL. By the time we got there, they told us our rooms are in Bay tower. It's even farther down away from everything. The rooms are decent, with the marina view, which is ok. The Bay tower doesn't have anything in the lobby, except for a small sitting area. It definately doesn't feel like a 4 star hotel. Like everyone else said, $22 for self park is too much. We had valet, which is nice cuz they kept your car there at the front the entire stay we were there. We were bothered by the airplane noise, it's actually quite loud. Don't book this hotel unless you want to be next to an airport and nothing else.

<Title>“It was so much more than I had expected.”
<Content>I came with my boyfriend, and my two best-friends for a nice night away on January 31. We stayed in separate rooms (my boyfriend and I in one, and my best-friends in another). I read the reviews online, and saw several bad reviews on the Bay Tower, so we requested the Marina Tower. It was absolutely gorgeous. My best-friend's room was room 625. It overlooked the city, which was a very beautiful view. There was also a small view of the bay to the right. There were no problems with being by the airport. They said it was great watching the planes pass by, and they had absolutely no problems with sound. My boyfriend's and my room was 932. It was a water [bay] view, which cost a little bit more, but it was all worth it. The hotel room was peaceful and clean although we could hear our neighbors walking in and out of their room. Our view was perfect. In front, we oversaw the port in which there were hundreds of boats docked. Below us we could see the pool. We ate dinner at Harbor's Edge located in the hotel. It was nice and romantic with splendid food of all sorts and wonderful service. All rooms have their own, private balconies. The sliding glass doors are wonderful because you can see out of them, but no one can see in. The only flaws I would say there are include the size of the rooms. They are pretty small, and so are the bathrooms. And also the parking fees - $28 per night for valet, and $23 per night for personal parking. We used valet, and it all worked out find for us.

<Title>“Great value at $99 a room. Beautiful room and view.”
<Content>If I'd read the reviews on this site I would never have stayed but having missed my flight, I just wanted the closest hotel until the next day - and at $99 I thought it would be average. I got a beautifully appointed room and very nice bathroom. Great bed, desk, flat screen TV, coffee maker and a beautiful view of the marina. Despite other reviews, once the sliding door was closed, I couldn't hear the aiport. At the $99 rate I got which was available on their website as well as hotels.com this was a killer deal and I was very happy. Shuttle to and back from the airport was good also.

<Title>“Better than expected”
<Content>My boyfriend and I wanted to get away for my birthday, so we chose to go to San Diego since we had a great time there on our anniversary. After booking our room on Hotwire, I read a few reviews on the Sheraton Hotel and Marina on Yahoo, Hotels.com, and here on TripAdvisor, and was filled with great remorse for agreeing to book a hotel without knowing the name of the place, so I must admit we had low expectations for our stay. However, as soon as we stepped out of the car, we were treated with respect, which was surprising since we are in our early 20's and aren't ever taken seriously, and the staff was very friendly and professional. The front desk was very slow and very busy with a whole line of guests, but the receptionist was kind enough to upgrade us to a Deluxe Room in the Marina Tower, which had a beautiful view of the marina and the city lights surrounding it. However, the walls were so thin, you could hear the conversations in the hall and in the room next door. Despite this, and the fact that the airport is a half mile away, I very rarely noticed the noise of the planes, unless the balcony door was left open. Our room was smaller than I had expected, and the color scheme of dark blue and bright red gave me a headache, but as mentioned before, the view was beautiful. It seemed like the hotel was understaffed, especially since it was a weekend. We called for room service, and were placed on hold for at least 5 minutes. It then took over a half hour for them to just send up tea, and about 10 to 15 minutes for towels, and when we called valet to prepare our car, they did not answer the phone a good portion of the time. The pool area was beautiful. We went swimming during the night, when there weren't any pool attendents, but that didn't bother us. What did bother us was the fact that the bottom of the pool was falling apart. There were little pieces of plaster that would stab your foot, and big chunks of plaster missing from the ground. If you plan on going out of the hotel to sight see and what not, then this hotel is just fine. But if you want to actually stay in the building to relax, this might not be the best place. Sometimes it would reek of chemicals in the middle of the night, mostly in the hall, when there wasn't any cleaning going on. And despite the slow service, the staff was consistantly friendly and professional and very sincere about any of the delays they were having.

<Title>“Beautiful view of Bay - great hotel.”
<Content>We arrived on a cool, windy, crisp day for a three day stay - the sky was gray blue and we were able to upgrade in the bay building to the 10th floor (the view of the bay was incredible from the balcony). The main restaurant and gym is located 5min away in the marina bldg - exit the hotel and it's a strait shot along the marina/water/boats which was a very pleasant walk. The harbors edge restaurant had great food and great waitors. The only issue I had was when we first checked in and was given the choice of valet parking and "self parking". The staff made self parking out to be free, and unfortunately we found out on our last day that "Self Parking" is $22 a night. This was quite a deflator, as our long weekend at the Sheraton had been perfect to that point. I would understand a flat fee for parking, but robbery is how i feel this played out. When i asked the customer service lady about the charges she tossed away all responsibility by saying "the parking service isn't a part of the sheraton". Maybe this should be the first statement out of their mouths when a guest checks in so they can find somewhere less expensive to park. Or maybe the Sheraton should just offer free self parking.

<Title>“Clean rooms, poor internet connection, poor $ management”
<Content>The facility itself was very nice and the location is ideal: very close to the airport (noise didn't bother me) and the marina. I was there for business and had major problems conducting my work given their very poor Internet connectivity. They never resolved the issue in my room and could only offer to change my room. The connection in their lobby was poor: very slow and then they would block your computer after one hour. Even their computers were slow. When their "engineer" came to the room (unannounced), his call to a 1-800 number was charged to our room ($2)! I was also irritated when after I checked out, all Internet access for me was blocked within 2 hours (my last name didn't match the current visitor to my room). Couldn't they just extend the Internet access for a couple of hours?! Another co-worker had to change her room due to a water leak. This is a lot for $240 per night. I have no inclination to return.

<Title>“Husband and I enjoyed our stay”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here for one night. We upgraded to a club level room and thoroughly enjoyed the complimentary club floor appetizers in the evening and the buffet breakfast the following morning. We had a room overlooking the pool, marina and bay - it was fabulous. Our room had recently been remodeled and it was great. The bed was heavenly - very comfortable. The hotel is right near the airport, but it must be pretty well sound-proofed, because we were not at all bothered by air traffic noise. We would stay here again.

<Title>“Two hotels on property - not equal in quality - be aware.”
<Content>There are actually two hotels on this property - one is the Bay Tower and one is the Marina Tower. I was unfortunate enough to stay in the Bay Tower. Stayed three nights. Checked in just before midnight the first night. I got stuck on the ground floor to begin with. Then, I was not notified that there would be an additional charge for parking a car during my stay. After fumbling around in the the parking lot, I finally had to go back in and ask and found it was $20.00 additional per night. That was my first disappointment. A 4 start hotel and you have to pay for parking? After I got to the room, the bathroom floor was filthy. Covered with hair - disgusting. This is a 4 star hotel? We got up the first morning to some wonderful in room coffee, left a tip for the staff and went about our day. We got back late that evening and the room had been cleaned. All's well. We needed to connect to the internet to check e-mail. It was a $12.00 charge per day! We got up the next morning to discover that our coffee had not been replenished. Not a good way to start the day. We returned around 6:00 in the evening and wanted to sit by the marina and have a cocktail. We found out to do that we would have to walk 5 minutes to the other hotel or walk 10 minutes the other direction to a resturaunt. This is a 4 star hotel? We did our thing and went out for dinner and returned later that evening. I wanted to get soda from a machine only to find out there were no soda machines in the building - you had to call room service or take one from the mini-bar - a 12 oz can for $3.88? I could by a half a case of 12 oz cans for that. Got up the next morning to discover that the maid neglected to replenish the soap in the bathroom. And, did I mention that this is a 4 star hotel? Save your money. Holiday Inn Express does a much better job for less money. Over priced but still available soda machines, usually free parking, free high speed internet, clean rooms always replenished. This place is a HUGE rip off. Did I meantion that this is a 4 star hotel? They did comp me the $63.88 for the parking and soda from the mini-bar, but I will not be too quick to stay in a Sheraton again any time soon.

<Title>“Burglary in the parking lot. Sheraton takes NO responsibility”
<Content>My car was broken into at this Sheraton property. The cost for repairs was over $2500. Sheraton employees acknowledged that this is a 'high crime area.' And they knew that a rowdy bunch from a wedding party were causing trouble that night. Yet they provided no security to prevent the burglary. Although the lot has a Sheraton sign, and the parking is paid on the hotel room bill, Sheraton claims the lot is owned by a company called 'Mile High.' After repeated inquiries, both Sheraton and Mile High have failed to take any responsibility for my loss.

<Title>“Not bad-pricey for what you get”
<Content>Stayed 5 nights attending a conference in mid-Sept. I was lucky enough to get a recently renovated room but travelled with a colleague who wasn't - less than impressive. My balcony overlooked San Diego skyline and the bay which was nice. Room was clean, comfortable but drastically over-priced...this is not a resort by any means. Mini fridge would have been nice. My biggest problem here, and for all you Canadians out there READ THIS!! Let me set the stage here...Now I was on a business trip to Phoenix last April for 8 days and of course you call home (especially with wife and 2 young kids). Work pays for some but I knew I would have to cover some costs...total for 8 days of phone charges in Phoenix was $220 which to me, was reasonable. So here I am in San Diego, granted a bit further West but not that much. Of course I call home from my room 2-3 times a day for a few minutes and this for 5 days..not 8. The night before checking out I go to the front desk to get my total....are you ready for this? $656.00 in long distance charges!!! Work ain't paying for this one. Most of my calls were for 2- 5 minutes. I have 4 charges of $19.19 for calls I made where I got the answering machine, almost $80 and I spoke to know one. So $20 for the first minute and $5 dollars/min thereafter. I found my old Phoenix bill to compare and I had spoken 22 minutes more on that trip which, may i remind you, only cost me $220 in phone charges. Not sure who is making a killing here but someone is!

<Title>“Awesome Experience”
<Content>My friend and I stayed here while attending Comic-Con this summer. I was apprehensive, because I had heard horror stories regarding hotel rooms booked through the official Con site, and our flight was arriving at 10 AM, a whole 5 hours before check-in. We decided to head to the hotel early anyways, to see if they could at least hang onto our luggage for us. I really shouldn't have worried. Even though I arrived at eleven, they were able to check me right in. They even let me change the room to two beds instead of one! The room was gorgeous, overlooking both the pool and the ocean. It was clean, it was trendy, and it had a minibar which was a fun perk. My only complaint would be the scratchy towels. At one point, I actually opted to air-dry. We ate in both the pub and the Harbor Side restaurant. The food was excellent in both places. It was a little on the pricey side, but that was to be expected. The pool was great, too. I don't know if it was open all night, but I was down there about midnight and nobody bothered us. We stayed five nights altogether, and I was so bummed to leave. I would love to go back sometime.

<Title>“Run-down and noisy - Beward the "Club Floor"”
<Content>Expect smallish rooms that are badly in need of remodeling. Shower is just a trickle, carpet is worn, TV is ten years old, etc. I paid extra for the club floor, on the top two floors of the hotel. However, my room overlooked the service area for the tent they had erected for a conference. There was noise of forklifts and trucks all day. I went to sleep to the sound of backup alarms every night. The club itself is physically attractive, but quite a rip-off. Don't expect free self-service drinks as in most such places. Everything is brought by a waiter. Alcoholic drinks are at regular hotel bar prices. Non-alcoholic drinks are free, but then they make a big show of presenting a zero bill on which you are supposed to include a tip, so unless you want to be a jerk you end up paying a high price for your free drinks. Breakfast and evening snacks are sparse and tired-looking. The location of this hotel is great. There's nothing here that a little demolition wouldn't fix.

<Title>“Nice view, 'average' Sheraton”
<Content>We have been to San Diego many times and tend to stay on Shelter Island - but things were pretty booked, so we opted for the Sheraton on Harbor Island. I had been there before for business conventions (just during the day, but was not booked into the Sheraton) and it had been fine. We stayed in the 'bay' tower, which is a bit of a hike from the main hotel [You may want to ask which building you are in prior to arriving]. The room was 'ok', a bit worn ... slightly noisy when the neighbors got loud. The view was wonderful, but make sure you get the bay side, not the marina side. We arrived real late (due the the flight) around midnite - major disappointment was that there is no room service between midnite and 6am, so we had to scrounge the fast food places a few miles away for dinner. There is a small restaurant and bar in the building, but they did not seem to be open late either. We did try room service prior to leaving - the waiter was extremely nice, the food was average. Staff was nice, but sometimes the 'operator' would take 2 minutes or so to answer, even during the daytime. Could be due to the fact that they were having a large number of weddings there for that weekend, which may have absorbed all of the staff time. Maybe the main, vs. the 'bay' hotel property has less issues. Although they have one free computer in the lobby for internet (it worked about 90% of the time), it was a drag to have to pay $11-$12 per day for internet access in the room. Seemed that there were a number of 'per day charges' (parking, etc. - which they seemed to waive for us as we are Sheraton club members - bet we did pay about $10/hr 'late check out' charge [it was our choice to stay later, due to a late flight back and they were very up front about the cost]). Although the hotel is right across the road from the airport, we did not notice a lot of airplane noise, which was very surprising. As we left, the staff even brought our car around, even though we did not 'valet park' - a nice touch. We might stay again, but would if our preferred hotels on Shelter Island were not available.

<Content>We arrived at the hotel and check in was very quick. We booked a regular room with a minimal view, but we had guests visiting us from France and the hotel employee gave us a free upgrade to a room with a view of the Marina. He was a very nice man and the hotel was great. The view was very beautiful. I would definitely recommend staying here. We did not hear any noise from the airplanes even though the airport is right next to the hotel. We enjoyed our stay very much!

<Title>“Careful”
<Content>Booked a 3 night downtown 4 star hotel via Hotwire at the Sheraton. Arrived late in the day after traveling from the East Coast. We were shuffled into the bar as they were still "preparing" our room ? Eventually the bar closed and we moved to the lobby area still waiting, only to eventually learn at 1 AM (4AM our time) that there was no room being prepared and there were no rooms available in San Diego?? In fact our only choice was to drive 35 miles to another Sheraton property in Carlsbad for what was left of the night. Not a great start to our vacation and we felt we were misled (if not repeatedly lied to) and taken advantage of as our trip was prepaid via Hotwire. We kept Hotwire informed and they made contact with Sheraton and have worked out compensation. Kudos to Hotwire!. Sheraton needs to work on their process and management teams communications. We will avoid Sheraton in the future. We did return to the hotel for nights 2 and 3 as we had prepaid. The hotel is nice enough, close to the ariport and a huge marina sits along side the hotel. Hotel is a car drive or cab ride to any downtown locations. Pool area was nice and the Sheraton did attempt to recover witha nice marina view room and breakfast. Be careful when booking this hotel and actively confirm and verify your arrival. If you really desire a downtown hotel near attractions this is not the hotel for you.

<Title>“Sheraton is average”
<Content>In general, this hotel is OK. Tim Clark and Michael (outside) and Stacy (at the concierge) were the most helpful and friendly!! They deserve a raise :) The room was average, I was in Marina tower, 5th fl. The shower curtain liner was had mold spots (gross!!), the wood on the sink was peeling off, the trim around the closet had many black scuff marks and the carpet in front of it had a few stains. The bed skirts had white stripes that were not part of the pattern -( almost like when you do your laundry and paper is in there and it sticks to your black shirt out of the dryer). The telephones did not ring- (yes, I checked, the ringers on BOTH phones were on high) and the bedside phone allowed you to hear a person, but the person you were [attempting] to speak with would not be able to hear you. I tried to tell someone about this EVERY day for the 4 days I was there...they sent someone up to my room at 9pm on the last day- just as I was falling asleep. I called the front desk to ask what the deal was and they stated "we tried to call you, but when we got no answer, we thought something was wrong" - ya think??? How many days had I been requesting the phones to be fixed????? Geesh! In the bar, the bartender Chandra was either having a bad day or was just overwhelmed with the amount of people trying to get drinks or food. SUGGESTION: get her someone to wait on tables!! They offer free internet, but after 3 days of being unable to coneect, and again, talking to the front desk - rather than trying to fix the problem, they kept referring me to the business center in another part of the hotel. I was assured each day that it would be fixed...on the 4th day, Stacy from the concierege desk actaully came over and watched me log in. She then worked a little magic and within under 1 minute, I was good to go. The conference I was there for was great and the ball rooms and meals during the conference were a perfect setting for the function. In general, good venue for large groups and the rooms are simply a convenience - I would not stay there on a vacation, though....

<Title>“Not worth the $$”
<Content>I was anticipating my two night stay here at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina, but now regret my decision to stay here. I generally enjoy my stays at Starwood hotels as I am a Platinum Preferred, however, I will never spend a night at this particular hotel. First the good -Plenty of on site parking -Free airport shuttle -Friendly desk staff -Great views of downtown from the 7th floor balcony Now the bad -Poorly maintained room (missing granite piece in bathroom, filthy light fixtures, hole in the wall near door (not caused by door). -Parking, not mentioned in my itinerary is $20/night, $26 for valet. -No WIRELESS internet, you can connect to the all but high-speed for only $12.95/24hrs -Half eaten items leftover in the "Refreshment Center" For the rate I paid, the room left quite a bit to be desired, if you don't need to stay near the airport, less expensive alternatives should be considered

<Title>“Fantastic hotel”
<Content>We had a lovely room overlooking the marina. The staff could not have been more helpful, open and friendly. At the concierge desk they gave us consistently good advice about what to see and how to get there. San Diego itself is a wonderful location. The light and the flowers and cleanliness of the whole area is amazing. We had been in another hotel the previous week and had been caught by the sensor in the mini bar (not that they charged us when we explained we had only opened it to put something in there, although getting the bill at 5 am on the morning of our departure was a bit of a shock) but this time we asked for a fridge and they provided it no trouble , to save any misunderstanding with the mini bar.

<Title>“Failed to deliver!”
<Content>Waited in a very long and slow queue at check in (only two desk opens) only to find they had 'deleted' our reservation (made months ago) and could not provide the interconnecting rooms requested . Eventually got rooms allocated only to find that one of them had a flooded bathroom (from a leaking toliet - nice!). Moved rooms (with an apology) to then be woken at 4am with a fire alarm (and evacuation) apparently caused by a leak. it was quite clear staff did not know what to do which was not reassuring and there was no communication. We actually had an enjoyable stay in spite of these factors but you were definitely left with the impression that this was a hotel failing to deliver on the basics and one where client care was almost non existent.

<Title>“Nice hotel in good location”
<Content>My boyfriend and I recently stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed our stay. The staff were lovely, check in was very quick and the hotel itself is well presented and clean. Our room was average, exactly what you would expect from a Sheraton, lovely big comfortable bed, adequate bathroom but spotlessly clean and a small balcony over looking the harbour and downtown San Diego. The pool is lovely and not busy at all as this seems to be mostly a business hotel. We didnt hear any noise from the airport at all. There isnt a great deal else on Harbour Island other than the other part of the Sheraton, a Hilton and a fantastic restaurant called Island Prime which is always pretty busy so book first, it has excellet views across the bay of downtown. We went into the gas lamp quarter in downtown 2 nights as it is only a 10 min taxi ride and there are some great bars and restaurants there. Try The Ivy Hotel, it has a rooftop bar with huge fire pits where you can sit outside overlooking the city. Back to the Sheraton though where there are two bars, one is Quinns which has pool tables and tv's etc and the other is the main hotel bar which is nice an relaxing with the most friendly bar staff. You can take your drinks outside by the fire pit which over looks the harbour, its so relaxing. Overall a lovely hotel in the ideal location as its only 10 mins drive to Seaworld, La Jolla, Coronado and Downtown. Finally.....you must visit Hotel Del Coronado because it is beautiful and has so much history, plus they serve an excellent lunch, in fact if you have more money just stay there instead!

<Title>“Nice Stay”
<Content>Okay, as a San Diego native, there is no question that the Sheraton still retains that California feeling. In fact if you take your self (Walking) outside of the hotel and to the East you will see an amazing view of downtown that even I did not know existed. In fact, you usually have to go to to the other side by way of the Coronado Bay Bridge to enjoy such a view. Minutes from the very best of San Diego: Balboa Park, San Diego Zoo and Gaslamp Quarter. I find at times that the hotel transported me to circa 1970's, but the pool and grounds more than made up for this. I do agree with the other reviewers: For a grander experience, the Marina Tower has exceptional service and closer to the middle of all of the action.

<Title>“Got a great deal”
<Content>I booked this room without knowing its identity, on Hotwire - only paid $129/nite plus the $20/nite fee for parking-still quite a deal compared to their published rates-after I got the name of the hotel, I quickly checked reviews to find some negative comments about the hotel - I called the hotel directly- and worked with them on getting the Bay Tower - which the rooms are Larger ( or so I am told)-----and honestly, they gave us a Bay facing room on the 7th floor - we watched three sets of fireworks on our patio the night of the Fourth, and it was a great view......I would say to just be sure about which building you want to be in when you make the reservation...for us, a larger room was more important than the larger pool area that the other tower offered....the experience was a lot better than I expected, given the online reviews that I had read in advance of getting there - yeah, their computers were not working when I tried to check in, but , that wasn't so bad - we just left our luggage and checked in later.

<Title>“Tricky Tricky”
<Content>Upon arrival at the Sheraton which looked beautiful as we pulled up to it, we realized that since our room was booked in the Bay Tower, we were not staying at the Hotel we pulled up at. We were to continue down the road to another Sheraton. The Bay Tower wasn't too bad but definately not as nice as the main sheraton. The front desk seemed very excited to tell us about the beautiful view of the Bay from our room, which it's true, we could see the bay...but the ugly parking lot was in between us and the bay. The room was clean but didn't seem to be up to par with other Sheraton's we've stayed at prior to this trip. On our confirmation email, it stated to please enjoy the Continental Breakfast which at any Best Western or any other cheaper hotel/motel...translates COMPLIMENTARY! Wrong we were, The set up was like that of a help yourself complimentary station with the typical muffins, fruit, oatmeal, and coffee. EXCEPT we were charged $3.00 for a coffee that we poured ourself ( had we known, we could have just made coffee in our room with the provided coffee pot). There was a starbucks at the main Sheraton but we would have had to walk quite a distance or get in our car just to get a cup of coffee. The muffins were $3.00/ea. and the banana's were $1.50/ea. Which seemed like such a rip off...I mean we were spending $200/night and they had to charge us for a banana! On the day of Check out we got our bill slipped under our door and it had five (5) addit'l. charges. We inquired what these were at the front desk and they said that we ate the food out of the mini fridge. in the room, which we didn't. It was over $30.00 in charges that kind of just looked like service/tax fees had we not looked into it. They quickly got rid of the charges without any questions. Interesting enough our friends who were staying at the hotel too recieved charges from the fridge. which they had not even opened either. What a scam...had we not questioned it...they would have made an extra $30.00 off us...for nothing.They obviously do this often for they didn't even question our us about the additional charges they just removed them. I'm very dissapointed in the Sheraton, I thought that name stood for QUALITY ....this one proved that wrong. We also wanted to grab some food and a drink and since the bar at our Bay tower was closed at 9pm on a Friday night, we had to drive over to the Main Sheraton ( kind of a pain) we went to the little lounge and ordered drinks which took over 35 mins to get from the time we ordered...seriously are they trying to drive business away on purpose? We had some friends with us that had children , which the lounge said it was acceptable for them to stay until 11pm. We ordered food (which was okay...not bad but not fabulous) we then sat there waiting and waiting for our check. Our server was nowhere in sight, we finally asked a different server if we could please get our check, all of a sudden our server appeared with the check and told us that we needed to get out of there because it was past 11pm, well we would have been out of there by 10:30 had she not dissapeared on us. That was very poor service and unprofessional on her part. So to sum it up...we woudn't not stay there again. There were way too many scams and things that kind of blind sighted us. Perhaps the rooms at the Main tower were nicer but that's a chance we're not willing to take. If you decide to stay here....beware!

<Title>“Pretty average”
<Content>Better than a Motel 6, but not by much. Like most people, I stayed here for a conference. Had my company not been paying for it, I would not have chosen here and would not return here. I also would encourage my company to choose another place in the future. The room was pretty basic, not uncomfortable. It looked a little worn, but was clean enough. It's pretty obvious that a large amount of people come in and out of the rooms for big conferences. There was nothing outstanding, worth mentioning about any of the rooms (I saw several) or the hotel in general. It's right on the bay, and literally across the street from the airport. Despite my expectations I did NOT hear the airport, armed services or bay while in my room. My understanding is that may be a unique experience. The bay might have been a nice view, but it was very cloudy the entire time I was there. A lot of the rooms had pretty big holes in the wall from fixtures being moved or removed. Many walls had stains and a lot of the furniture was pretty scarred. This was stuff you had to look for, but it was apparent they had made no attempt to cover most of this. I had trouble with my bathroom door not closing tightly. Pretty basic room, modern decor with a comfortable enough bed. I'd recommend not going here, and if you are doing a conference, try to find another place.

<Title>“better than the previous reviews”
<Content>Arrived June 27 and stayed until July 3rd. Based on previous reviews I was a little apprehensive. Rented a car at the airport and parked in the main lot, no problem there. Walked in 3 hours before check-in and our room was ready. Our room was supposed to be on the concierge level but that was booked. They did however give us the privileges to the club and our room was in the main hotel. I had a rate of $229.00 for a convention I was attending. $20 a day additional to park in the lot, with in and out privileges. Information desk was very helpful and gave us directions to anywhere we were heading. Bartenders nice inside the main hotel. A few minor things for improvements. Walls were a little thin and could hear kids in the next room only one day. One elevator kept breaking down. Bathtubs with mildew around the stopper that needed just a good scrubbing. Club level has one computer for all business people to share. Unfortunately the days I was there, children were always on it making it impossible to check e-mail during my breaks from the convention. 4 computers down in the lobby for everyone else to share and they always were being used. They did give a 30 minute limit. Pool area was clean and perfect temperature. Plenty of chairs so that you did not have to fight for space. Workout room attendant was very nice and the room was clean. Machines seemed in good working order. Beautiful walking paths across the street. The pool does rent rafts for kids and adults and that is a definite plus. Beautiful views front and back of the hotel. Fireplaces outside to sit around in the evening and talk to other guest. Wait staff around pool was slow and bartender for the outdoors could have been a little friendlier. Check out was very smooth and fast. I would definitely stay here again. This area was central to everything we wanted to do. I would say this was a 9 on a scale to 10. Close to the airport but not too loud.

<Title>“Sheraton --Bay Tower”
<Content>We came for a Conference with a discounted rate, so I'm not sure if the two towers command the same room rates. The Bay Tower worked very nicely for us, but it does look like an older property re-branded as Sheraton. Our room looked onto the Bay and North Island-a very excellent view, no noise from airport. Between the two Sheraton towers is a good outdoor deli that serves the boat marina. It gets all the Sheraton guests for breakfast and lunch at cheap prices. Restaurants: The restaurant at the Bay tower is almost nonexistent. The restaurants at the main tower are deluxe, with terrace dining. Pool: Not too special at the Bay tower. The pools(two) at the main tower are deluxe/ resort oriented, with live entertainment and waiter service to the pool chairs... Lobby: At the bay tower, nothing special. At the main tower--Wow! lots of activity, fancy. Room: clean, good bed, couch, tv, mini-bar--don't touch it., bathroom clean. Parking: We got a special rate, but any charge is too much. After spending much time on the balcony soaking up the view, we would have been happy, but then we walked over to the main tower----WHAT is this !!... Is this the same hotel !!? The main tower has activities, live entertainment at the pool, lounges, Starbucks --I hope they charge less at the Bay tower! On the island, there are several restaurants within walking distance---besides the deli next to the hotel, there is the Boathouse restaurant with good prices, and Tom Ham's lighthouse, and Island Prime restaurant. By car, the Star of India/ Embarcadero/Coronado Ferry and Harbor Excursion is about 5 minutes away.

<Title>“Great Experience”
<Content>I saw a lot of negative reviews on this hotel and knew that it was built many years ago, so we were dreading having to deal with a run-down property in dire need of a facelift. We decided to make the best of it because we were attending an event that was within easy walking distance. I have to say that we were very pleasantly surprised. Everyone on the hotel staff -the front desk clerk who gave us a harbor view room, the chambermaid who went out of her way to chase down an item I needed, the waitress in the huge dining room - was courteous and professional. Our room, though not particularly large, was nicely decorated in a subtly nautical theme in warm wood tones, navy and cream. Of course, the little balcony and view of the pleasure boats moored below helped a lot! The spotless bathroom was well-lit, and had a granite countertop with a basket of toiletries and a curved shower rod, indicating it had been updated fairly recently. The only meal we had in the hotel was breakfast. The food was okay, but personally I don't think a totally basic breakfast for two should cost over fifty dollars. The only other amenity we used was the wi-fi in the lobby, which was available to hotel guests. Much appreciated. We liked the location, which is near Little Italy and other attractions of downtown; we didn't notice any noise from the airport which is very close. Although the hotel is large and shares many features of a corporate chain, the warm welcome and pleasant attitude of everyone we dealt with gave it a very personal vibe.

<Title>“No Guarantees Here!”
<Content>I reserved a room with a view over the phone and was promised a nice room one month in advance. Upon arrival we were told, "we can't guarantee rooms, but you can have one on the other side, the view of the airport is beautiful". Maybe someone should remind these beautiful minds what the definition of a reservation is! No effort was made to accommodate us, and our trip was ruined. I hope this doesn't happen to others, they are taking advantage of people who don't want to look like schmucks and complain!

<Title>“Good location/price ratio”
<Content>We were quite pleased when we arrived at this hotel in San Diego, after a terrible accomodation experience in New York City and a very bad flight. The price was definitely worth it and it was actually much cheaper than we thought for such a location. The rooms are clean and the beds are very confortable. We stayed on the ground floor and we had a very good view of downtown San Diego. The hotel was very quiet, even though there were many guests around, but most of them stayed there for business meetings or weddings. You could use computers free of charge in the other tower, which was just 2 minutes away from our tower. The staff was helpful and nice. There is nothing around the hotel (stores, restaurants, bars), but the complimentary shuttle service to the airport made it easy for us to reach the city. Buses to downtown run very often from the airport, but the service stops at approximately 12:30 am. If you are planning to experience some nightlife, than you should count on the cab on your way beck. It is approximately $15. However the nightlife ends pretty much around 1:30 am. It was a bit disappointing for us as we are used to the European style. You can ask for some booklets at the reception as San Diego and the sourrounding area offer lot of nice places to visit and there is a variety of tours offered. If I was to go back to San Diego I would choose this hotel again.

<Title>“Not new but definitely OK”
<Content>Before my attending a meeting at this Sheraton, I read the reviews posted on this site. After being there for 5 days, I have a better understanding of what it is about. As a disclaimer for this resort, I learned that it has been here for 40 years. With that said, you can look at areas of the hotel and see 40 years, and then others are as new as what you would find from a new construction hotel. This is how I break it down: THE LOBBY AND EMPLOYEES The lobby was beautiful and spacious with all the amenities you would expect from a finer hotel. There was a bellman stand and staffed concierge. The employees are top in serving your needs. Good hires that work with sincerity. There is a bar and restaurant in the lobby area that are both nice. ROOMS: This is a problem. There was a constant joke about the rooms being similar to a road side lodge. They are small. The bathrooms have been updated and were clean, as were the linens. The beds are comfortable and the room was satisfying overall, just nothing fancy or trendy. Be advised, not all rooms are interior corridors. You might need to be specific if you donâ€™t' like your door opening to the outside. Some colors and dÃ©cor are showing age. EXERCISE ROOM: I have yet to find a hotel/resort exercise room than can accommodate everyone that is trying to exercise at 6 AM. It could have been larger. All the exercise equipment was tops, just limited. There was plenty to do to get a full workout. It is San Diego and the weather was beautiful. Many, including me, ran along the coast on concrete path. POOL: I believe there were three total. I saw two. Both of which were very nice and bigger than normal. There were plenty of chairs to satisfy anyone wanting to sit by the pool and bake. The pool was even depth all the way across. MEETING ROOMS: It was evident that when this resort made upgrades it was done to the meeting facilities. Really nice in every way. LOCATION: This was good and bad. If you are flying into San Diego, you could walk to and from this resort. Literally across the street. The resort sits on the water and there is a very nice running path that is next to the water. The Sheraton is to two separate buildings. I was in the main building but guess it is a good 10 minute walk to the other. There are a couple restaurants within walking distance, but it is a 10 minute cab ride to the Gas Lamp district. Overall I would stay here again. I am big on service and effort and this property exceeded my expectation on both. I guess it depends on what your plans are. This was my fourth trip to San Diego in the past 4 years. With that said, I have stayed in 4 different properties. The other three were in and around the convention center. If you are looking to get away and simply relax with comfortable amenities, then the Sheraton is good enough. If you want to go to San Diego and walk to places, you should choose another place.

<Title>“DO NOT STAY HERE!!”
<Content>We stayed here for the Rock & Roll marathon. It was the worst experience ever! OVER PRICED AND DIRTY! On our way up to our room after checking in, we got stuck in the elevator for an hour (3 adults and 2 kids under 4 years old). My wife and my son did not want to get in the elevator again. We asked to switch to a room on ground level the next day and they said we were supposed to be checking out, but we had one more night left. It was even written on our room key that our check out date was the next day. Finally got that settled. They were supposed to credit my sister-in-laws room $50 for the elevator incident, but charged her $50! If you rent a car, $20 a day for parking in a dirt lot with not easy access to the hotel. Each day we had to talk to a manager, each time a different manager. NOT WORTH IT! The Hilton in La Jolla is much better!

<Title>“Just OK”
<Content>I was at this hotel for a large conference so I was able to see several of my coworkers' rooms in both the Marina and Bay Towers. Before arriving, none of us had a clue that the two hotels are entirely separate, and a good distance away. (Walkable but not fun in high heels for the conference events.) Although directly across from the airport, I never had an issue hearing planes inside my room. The Marina Tower building is the very large building you'll see on the hotel website. The lobby was very nice, receptionists very helpful. The rooms on this side varied - I saw one room on the lanai side which was kind of hidden at the very end of the hotel, and set up like a motel with the doors all facing an inner, outdoor courtyard. That room smelled very strongly of smoke (this is a non-smoking hotel room) and was dark and a bit run down looking. My own room was on the 10th floor, view was just OK - alot of the views are of the neighboring Coast Guard area or the airport, not exactly the beautiful marina and harbor you might be expecting. The room was clean, furniture a bit warn. The rooms over at the Bay Tower are larger (30% according to the front desk clerk) but the views aren't necessarily better. These rooms seemed newer and cleaner, with a Tommy Hillfiger type of atmostphere - lots of red and blue in the rooms. To anyone planning a large conference - don't dare let them stick your conference in that giant "Pavilion" room - it's a tent. A giant tent. With no bathrooms. And you'll hear every single plane and Coast Guard helicopter, every couple of minutes. People in the back of the tent could hear nothing at all. Add to that the wind blowing the whole thing the entire time, it literally sounded as though people were banging pots and pans outside the tent while speakers attempted to finish their speeches. Overall, I was happy with the room comfort and service staff but would never book this hotel for myself on vacation. You can find much better rates in the Mission Valley area (same distance from downtown as this hotel) and much better rooms in the downtown area.

<Title>“Nice hotel, but noisy and fridge taboo”
<Content>I stay at the Sheraton in May 2008 at the Bay tower. The hotel locates in a very beautiful location with a fantastic view. There is a nice path for jogging/walking and that is very nice and enjoyable. However, the nice view has a price to pay as it is far from downtown. There is no store nearby to buy personal items. No easy public transportation is available, except taxi. The parking fee at the hotel is quite high, about 20 dollars/day. It is also very noisy as the San Diego airport is nearby. You can hear them almost all the time. If you are a light sleeper, that could be a problem. The hotel has internet connection but for a fee if you use it in your room, but you can work at the lobby for 1hr free of charge. The one that I dislike the most is that you cannot use the hotel's refrigerator for stocking your drinks. The hotel will throw your stuff away and charge you 25 dollars each time for the rearrangement of the fridge. We pay 300 dollars/night and cannot use the fridge. Saying that, I really enjoy San Diego. The city is very beautiful and is a good place to visit. Next time, I would choose the hotel inside downtown that I could enjoy so many beautiful things nearby.

<Title>“Nice Location”
<Content>Stayed there for one night with my then 10 yr old son in between visiting Sea World and Legoland (!!). We got a good deal thru the Sheraton rewards program. Check in was very quick and easy. Front desk staff was very helpfull. The standard room was a little small, but it worked for the two of us (would not work for the whole family of 4, however!). Nice view of the harbor - several stories up so that we did not get much noise from the pool area. Very comfy beds! GREAT POOL FOR THE KIDS!! Shallow, warm with lots of statues spurting water! Inner tubes and floaty things available pool side. Drink service from the pool bar very slow. Room service was fast and tasty. Lots of kid friendly pay-per-view movie choices, but pricey. The Disney channel or Cartoon network would have been nice. The breakfast buffet looked a little exotic(and pricey) for my 10 yr old, so we opted for the local Denny's instead. Overall, great for the one night stay.

<Title>“Nickeled and Dimed”
<Content>We stayed here for Gator by the Bay which is located right outside the hotel, so the location is great. There were about ten of us from the same area staying there. The room was fine but customer beware of charges that sneak up on you. A member of our party rented a car through the hotel, was not informed of the need for a parking pass, and the hotel tried to charge him $40 to get his car back out of the lot the next morning. He refused to pay it, and they sold him the (ridiculously priced) $20 a night pass they should have told him about in the first place. It costs $12 to hook up to the internet in your room and you can't use wifi because the hotel has somehow blocked access to unsecured networks. You can see them on your laptop, but can't connect. A salad with moldy tomatoes wasn't taken off the bill in the hotel restaurant until we went back and complained, even though the waitress had been handed the moldy tomato before the bill was produced. The bottle of sunblock that costs $10 at the deli down the road costs $15 at the hotel, Miller Lite is over $5 a glass (Miller Lite? Good grief!), and don't take the offer of a refill on your soda unless you want to pay full price for another one. The front desk is understaffed. The airport shuttle is great and, strangely enough, free? What were they thinking? I think I'll probably skip Gator by the Bay and just go to other festivals. This was too much like being a captive money machine for the Sheraton.

<Title>“Below average stay at the Sheraton”
<Content>This hotel was below your "standard" Sheraton. It is old and in need of a remodel. The room was okay, but noisy. We could hear the room next door flushing the toilet and showering. The bathroom was average too. The service was below average. We reserved two rooms with King Beds, and were told that they did not have any and that our reservation was a â€œrequestâ€� and not a guarantee. As Starwood Gold members we expressed our dissatisfaction with this news and 5 minutes later we got our rooms. We only stayed here because we used our Starwood points, and we would probably not stay there again.

<Title>“Some highs, some lows -”
<Content>The hotel is a bit outdated and needs refreshing, but the room was quite comfortable and the view wonderful. Obviously being near the airport has some advantages and quite honestly we didn't hear the planes at all. Our biggest complaint was the $12 charge per day for the Internet. That was outrageous. When we complained we discovered that our convention had a deal on the Club rooms with complementary breakfast and afternoon snacks with free Interent for about $20 extra. Given the $12 charge this was the right deal for us on this trip. However, I agree with another writer that they should be specific about the parking cost and the Internet and include it in the price...it was simply ridiculous and started us in a bad mood upon our arrival. The staff has been quite cordial and the Club Floor a delight. I'll check out the pool and facilities tomorrow. By the way, our Club Room was no different than the original room we were offered. If you want to be near the action, this is not the place to be. It is quite far from the Convention Center, Gaslight area etc. We rented a car so it wasn't a problem for us.

<Title>“Pretty View, Close to Airport”
<Content>Had a lanai room that overlooked the marina which was really nice. The HVAC system is the type that comes on only when you are in the room so getting it warm enough when you arrive late is a challenge. The hotel seemed to be very heavily staffed with people to answer direction questions which was handy. Service in the restaurant is very slow, they seem to bring things then disappear and the restaurant wasn't very busy. Didn't get the chance to use it, but there was a lovely pool. Plenty of sidewalk and walking areas for a good walk and there were tennis courts. The meeting facilities were very good for the conference that we attended although the rooms were generally kept very cold. The exhibit hall in the basement felt a little cramped. This is out near the airport, not near downtown. It is about a $15.00 cab ride to the Gas Lamp district.

<Title>“Long on Price. Short on Service”
<Content>Understaffed check-in desk at peak time (7 pm) $20 self-parking includes very poorly lit parking lot and a long walk (the hotel was all too quick to point out that it wasnt their problem because the parking lot is managed by a third party). Valet is only $6 more (plus tip). Ignored by wait staff when attempting to order in the sports bar in the lobby. In their defense it was understaffed for the number of people in the bar, but they did wait on someone else first who came in after I did. The room was clean and comfortable althought the "lanai room" I had was downstairs and had no view. Avoid these rooms if possible. For the price ($189 per night) this could have been better.

<Title>“Club Room”
<Content>I had to travel for business and wanted to stay in San Diego before finishing the drive home. I decided to get a club room for the snacks and drinks. The room was worth the extra few dollars. The club was on the top floor (if I remember correctly) and had stunning views of the harbor and the city. The food was GREAT and the club was large and very well decorated, including fire place, flat screen and waiters if you needed mixed drinks. We stayed one floor below the club and didn't mind taking the trip up. I would have liked to have been on the same floor but I wasn't going to complain to the front desk. The room was great for the extra-large bed and great comfortable chair. The room was very high up in the tower and had a balcony. It was a great view. No fridge but it was the club that offered the food we needed in the evening and morning. We played ping pong for fun in the evening and took a nice walk around the marina. There were people staying on their boats and the noise from the Marina was loud at night, as we stayed on a Friday night. In fact, the noise from the parties on the boats was booming until the wee hours of the morning. This is a drawback since the room was 18 floors up. For the cost, this was a great deal and met all the Sheraton standards in the room.

<Title>“Caveat emptor (let the buyer beware)”
<Content>I travel several times a year to medical conferences. My husband and I selected this property because we wanted to take our dog along and I wanted it to be in proximity to the hotel that was hosting the conference. This place was bad enough that we might have to leave the dog at home next time! First, the buildings are tired and decrepit. There was a crack in the sink, the light fixture in the bathroom took two or three minutes to warm up enough to provide light, and one of the bedside lamps required a phone call to maintenance on our first night there. Some of the staff were nice enough, but several were downright surly. When my husband went back to the front desk to find out why we were only given a AAA discount for one night of our stay and why we had been charged twice for one movie, the desk clerk tried to rescind the discount for the one night we had received it! We did have a nice, albeit expensive meal seated out on the patio behind the lobby. However, none of the staff could figure out how to light the propane heaters during our meal so I had to go into the gift shop and buy a jacket for each of us for dinner. There is a charge for the internet in your room and for parking. Corporate America's mantra these days seems to be to hook you with the promise of cheap prices and then burn you once you commit. In Corporate America's mind, the old bait and switch still works. Charging $20/day for a guest to park at your hotel is an outrage. What did they think? That we wouldn't be bringing a car? Tell us the real price of staying at your hotel and charge us that price and then we'll leave satisfied. However, tell us one price, load on the extra charges and we're not likely to return. It must be something about the Starwood properties...I haven't had a very good experience with any of them. I should have stuck with my initial plan of staying at the Omni downtown. For an extra $60 a night, we probably would have had a dog friendly room with much better service.

<Title>“very nice hotel, good experience”
<Content>Stayed here for one night as the Westin Horton Plaza was booked and I also wanted to be close to the airport. This hotel is literally across the highway from the airport, a 5 minute cab or shuttle ride (although the shuttle takes time waiting for others). They have constructed the hotel so that all rooms face the bay or marina and none is facing the airport. I heard absolutely no airport noise. Check in was fast and friendly, stop to greet the numerous and fabulous fish in their tropical tank. I felt the hotel was in pretty good, if not excellent, shape. The room was nice and spacious with a little balcony with a table and chairs. All standard SPG amenities are to be found as well as Starbucks coffee pods for the automatic brew. The shades are perfect for blacking out the room and the bed was standard (i.e. excellent) SPG sweet sleeper. I had a beer and empanadas at the bar, nothing special, in fact the empanadas were a bit dry, but I didn't complain since I was tired arriving at 9pm from NYC. The hotel restaurant and lounges were plenty busy and people were smiling, not sure if it was the Final Four or the food. There were plenty of weights and machines in the gym and it was not crowded for a Sat morning when there aren't too many people awake at 0700. The pool was nice and heated and would be very nice on a hot day. Signage to the gym could be improved as they get you in the right direction and then cease to exist, leaving you (me) wandering the floor hoping to trip into the gym. The location is good if you want to be close to the airport, but I can see how it would be a pain for those hoping to see San Diego. It's only 5-10 minutes to downtown, but this means a $10 cab ride each time you go in and then have to return. Walking would be a nice choice if you have 30-40 minutes, but there's a sidewalk along the bay with a great view.

<Title>“Cockroach in our room”
<Content>We just came back from staying here because we had too. First, we tried to cancel our room and move but note that you have to cancel a week prior to your stay. The hotel charges you for your whole stay a week prior to your stay. Second my husband was speaking at a conference there at the hotel. I should of know at that time this will be an interesting stay. It started out that I thought they had 24 hour shuttle service to the hotel. They donâ€™t!! We got in late waited for the shuttle as instructed when I called to confirm my resevation. They did not bother to tell me that it does not run after midnight. They were aware that we were checking in late. We took a taxi over to the hotel. No big deal it was 7.00 with tip. It took less than 5 min. We checked into our first room at 12am and it smelled like a bar with horribly stained carpet. Looked like someone spilt bleach all over the floor. My thought was to try to cover up the smell of a bar. We moved at that time to another room on the 12th floor. Security was nice and helped us move. We moved to the "new" room instantly and there was a cockroach in the bathroom. Security was still there and took care of the cockroach but they could not move us again because of the conference was taking up the whole hotel. We tried to move hotels but we would still have to pay 250.00 a night (we were there for 4 nights). The next morning we woke up to another cockroach in the bathroom. We let them know they explained that happens at times. Yuck!!!!!! We are paying how much a night!!! Housekeeping can in a great job of cleaning and we did not see another one. The third night the whole room filled up with cigarette smoke at 3am. Someone down below us was smoking in the bathroom and because at night the circulation slows down the cigarette smoke went into our room through the vent in the bathroom. Again called front desk no one came up or even got a call from anyone that they even cared that we could smell smoke. My husband is sensitive to cigarette smoke and it was irritating. Again when we check in they made us sign that we will not smoke in the hotel or on the balcony but no follow through. The next day during the day I went down a spoke to one of the front desk people. He stated he would give us a comp day for the unconvinced of the cockroaches and smoke. An hour later he called and could not comp a whole night so he credit our portfolio with just 100.00 credit and a pass to the club house for Hordâ€™oeuvres and breakfast. That was really nice of them but we had dinner and breakfast at the conference provided for us. I donâ€™t think this was fair but what else you are going to do except let everyone else know that it may look clean but know this hotel has a problem with cockroaches and let others make the decision to stay here. If you do make a reservation check out that you cannot get out of your reservation if you do find a cockroach. The positive thing is the pool was really nice.

<Title>“Yikes”
<Content>Sadly, I must agree with many of the postings on this site. What an odd stay. I was first given a room on the bottom floor of the Marina building. There were glasses with drinks on the patio that did not belong to me. I hoofed it back to the front desk and they put me on the 12th floor--much safer. Overall, the hotel does not seem clean or designed well. A few points: - Someone else's dry-cleaning was put into my room. - There were divots on the toilet seat & shower and the faucets were installed backwards - Stains on the bathrooms walls & splashes on the coffeemaker - The curved shower rod made the bathroom door unable to open all the way, so you'd sit on the toilet with the door between your knees - Deep creases in the bedspread. The bed was so poorly made, it was almost as bad as if I had made it! - The iron was so worn that you could not tell the setting The good parts were the Starbucks and Tazo tea that were provided (intermittently). Beware the long line at Starbucks in the morning, especially if there is a conference in the hotel. The free shuttle from the airport was another nice feature. It really was a peculiar stay: far away from San Diego proper, odd room, extraordinarily loud lobby with a strong perfume scent. I asked a bellman what it was and he said that it was Sheraton's proprietary aroma system. I'm glad that I was there for a conference because the nightly rate was far higher than I thought the stay was worth.

<Title>“Stay here only if you have no other choice”
<Content>I am writing this as I sit in my dingy hotel room waiting for my TV to "warm up" so I can catch the news/weather. I turned it on about 20 minutes ago and it is still not playing. I am in the Linai section of the hotel - which is probably the older section of the hotel - if that is possible. My room is available to anyone that wants to walk up to it becasue my door leads to the outside. I asked several times for a room change but the hotel is booked becasue of the conference that I am attending. I explained to them thaht as a single female I feel very unsafe. The staff was nice but unable to change my room which I can also hear every plane that takes off. Make sure you pack your sleep aid! I was really excited to see San Diego but the hotel is so far from downtown that I might as well be in middle America. If you have to stay here - try to stay in the main section of the hotel - it might be a little nicer. I am stuck here for a conferenc with no other choice.

<Content>Very convenient for the airport and easy access for the city bus lines if needed. Great views of the bay and the sail boat harbor. Sort of out of the way for the city proper though as its too far to walk. Room was perfect. No complaints. There are really two hotels here or at least two distinct buildings. Enjoy yourself.

<Title>“Not the best choice in San Diego”
<Content>I recently went to a conference at this hotel and found it adequate but not inspiring. As others have pointed out, this hotel is very isolated. It would definitely not be my first choice if I were in San Diego on vacation. The cab ride into town is about $12 each way. That adds a hefty price to the cost of a meal. We took the cab on the first night but then explored Harbor Island on foot the second day. There are 3 other restaurants on the island - one is exorbitantly priced and the other two are average quality seafood restaurants (the Lighthouse at the very end and the Boathouse). They are an easy walk from the hotel. Regarding the quality of the hotel: We stayed in the West Tower (the smaller of the two) which was a 7-10 minute hike from the conference facilities. The walk was pleasant, along the marina and provide a little exercise at the start of the day. The first room we were assigned was facing the airport (marina side) and that's where you could hear every plane take off. We quickly changed to a room facing the bay side, which was much quieter. The view from the balcony was quite nice and peaceful; you could see the Coronado bridge and downtown San Diego. In the room, the furnishings were typical but the bed was not comfortable. After 5 nights, we couldn't wait to get out of there. The bathroom toilet flushed with a very loud noise (kind of like the newer toilets on an airplane) - not a big deal until your neighbor flushed there's in the middle of the night and you heard it in your room. The other complaint is the inconsistency of the shuttle bus. It was great to have a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel; but, the shuttle was supposed to take you from one building to the other. There was no schedule so you could wait quite a while for it. Generally we walked but later at night, we didn't want to walk in the dark along the water so we waited and waited.

<Title>“Okay Only If you're not paying for the Room!!”
<Content>I was in San Diego for a conference at this hotel, so thankful I did not have to pay for my stay. The advantage to being so close to the airport is also a major disadvantage with the noise factor. And as mentioned by other reviewers, the low flying frequent helicopters in the area were quite disturbing, especially if you tried to walk outside to enjoy the marina. I stayed in the east tower and was given a room on the first floor with a parking lot view! I was foolish not to ask for a better room, thinking that it wouldn't matter since I would be in meetings the majority of my time. Little did I know that the hotel would be the site of several wedding receptions that went late into the night. Imagine trying to sleep with the sound of loud celebrants outside my window, car fobs continually chirping as people returned to their cars, and car alarms going off without end! The room was well worn and partially for that reason didn't seem quite clean. I did appreciate the coffee maker in the room, but since it only brews one cup at a time, I can only imagine the negotiations that must go on between couples for the first cup! This hotel also boasts their huge internet center in the lobby. They have about 8 to 10 computers, but that is not helpful when all but 2 of them have "Out of Order" signs on them. I desperately wanted to print my airplane boarding pass since I had an early flight, but the 2 working computers were being monopolized by people that felt no sense of courtesy. Yes, there is a Starbucks inside the hotel. No, they will not honor any Starbucks gift cards that you may have. I did not dine in any of the restaurants, but the meals prepared for the the conference were wonderful. My room didn't have any hotel information books or maps so I have no idea how many restaurants were available or what they offered. I did consider room service one evening, but when I couldn't locate any menus, I gave up and bought a pastry from Starbucks. I was concerned because my return flight left at 6:30AM. I inquired and was told the Hotel Airport Shuttle would start running at 5:00AM, stopping at the other tower before heading to the airport. This concerned me because I am accustomed to flying out of Atlanta and you really need to allow time to get through long waits at security. I arrived to check out at 4:40AM. Although my room was covered, I always like to be sure that nothing has been put on my credit card. There was a gentleman checking out ahead of me and he was having huge issues. He went back and forth with the receptionist. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a Hotel Airport Shuttle pull up, load 2 passengers and take off! I looked at my watch and it was 4:50AM! The gentleman behind me looked at me and we both screamed in unison! Another shuttle arrived shortly after 5:00AM, and I climbed on not a minute too soon! All of us thought that since every seat was full that we would go straight to the airport and not stop at the other tower. WRONG!!! Can you believe that we had to try and load more passengers (who had to stand) and their luggage on an already filled to the max shuttle?? By this time I was so nervous that I was going to miss my flight, especially since we had to stop and unload passengers at each terminal. Mine was last. I really prefer to write good, positive reviews, but I appreciate the people that share their unpleasant experiences also. Maybe this will help someone make a better plan. I did not have a choice about where I stayed this time. If you are planning a vacation, please research other hotels that are better situated and better maintained than this one. You will be so glad that you did!

<Title>“Major Disappointment”
<Content>I was assigned a room in the Lanai section of the hotel. It's not in the main hotel building. The rooms in that section are old and gross. The first room that I was assigned had a really loud fan in the bathroom and the room had not been cleaned. I checked in at 9pm. The shower had been obviously been used and there was still trash in the room. The second room I was assigned had been cleaned, but the bathroom walls and ceiling were moldy. The vanity was stained and chipped. I stayed at the hotel for 4 days for a conference. During my stay, I found centipede-like bugs in my room twice. For the price the hotel charges for these rooms, I would have expected something nicer. The only thing redeeming about my stay was that the staff was nice. I would definitely not recommend this hotel.

<Title>“great staff, dirty hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at this hotel for business reasons. The hotel staff was fantastic, although the girl at the front desk who checked us in wasnâ€™t the friendliest person--she wasnâ€™t too bad. The bellhop who helped us with our bags was really nice, and later during our stay my friends and I used the concierge several times and were treated great. They were very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. Also, the valets were great--giving us bottled water every morning to take on our sightseeing trips, great ideas on where to shop, etc. I loved the lobby, there was a Starbuckâ€™s (a real plus for me), a nice gift shop, and there was a beautiful aquarium, also a really nice area for businessâ€”computers, etc. All in all the first floor is great. Now on to the guest rooms--the rooms were a bit shabby. The bathrooms were small. Everything was in need of paint and wallpaper, and they really need some new soft beds. Ours was as hard as a rock! So while we were not too impressed with the rooms, on the plus side--they had Starbuckâ€™s coffee in the room, also a nice little balcony with 2 chairs so that depending on which side of the hotel you were on, you could enjoy either a beautiful sunrise or sunset. We had a city view and loved it. Be advised though of the airport noise, it canâ€™t be avoided, but it does stop between midnight and 6:00 am.

<Title>“Signs of aging”
<Content>Stayed a total of 4 nights. For over $200 a night, i expected more. Room that i stayed in is showing signs of overuse. Could use some renovation. Furniture looks a little worn. At least it doesn't look/feel dirty. I can find similar conditions hotels for 1/2 the price.

<Title>“A Joy Ride for your Expense Account”
<Content>My husband had a business meeting in San Diego and asked me to join him and make it into a mini-vacation. Arrangements were made by his associates at a special rate; hence I can't quote the usual price of this room. However, I would consider it to be run-of-the-house and standard. That said, it was fine. This should be considered a business hotel, rather than a vacation property. The Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina is one of two in the area in close proximity to Lindbergh Field, the San Diego International Airport. It is so close that one could practically walk there from the airport. We rented a car, though the hotel provides shuttles. The drive to the airport from the hotel is probably no more than five minutes. Though the location makes for a convenient launching point for San Diego activities, visitors should keep in mind that planes fly low over downtown San Diego creating a frequent roar of jet engines up above. The airport appears to close about midnight and not reopen until an early, but not unreasonable time the next morning. The planes are heard and seen from the hotel but didn't create a problem for us; they might for some. The hotel has over 1,000 rooms, all having balconys. Our room was what I would consider of an average size with two double beds and was comfortble enough for our adult daughter to spend two nights with us. It was tastefully decorated and all furniture, bedcoverings, etc. were crisp and clean upon our arrival. However, the view from this room was so enchanting that even a lesser appearing room would have gotten a thumbs-up here. The hotel faces San Diego Bay and our room had a glorious view of the city skyline and a great expanse of the bay. The room's small balcony with its table and two chairs was a class spot to enjoy your morning coffee while viewing the many sailboats and other vessels passing by. And as if to complement the daytime view, the San Diego night time brought on the city lights and a mad search for the proper camera exposure to capture them. The room was equipped with a television, clock-radio and a very simple little coffee maker that was fine for tea but questionable for coffee. For that ,management apparently wanted us to go into one of the hotel's restaurants. The room was also Internet equipped and the user would be connected for $11.95 a day. There was a stocked refrigerator in the room carrying sodas ($3.00), small waters ($3.50), Rice Krispies Treats ($4.00) and the like, "all prices subject to a 20% restocking fee." We passed on this little Sheraton moneymaker. We were all thankful for our cellular phones here because Sheraton fiercely guards outgoing calls from its rooms. They charge $2.00 for access per local call, up to 60 minutes per call with .10 per each additional minute beyonyd that first hour. Toll free calls will set you back the same as above. Want operator assistance, or making a credit card call? It's all the same to these folks. If you need to call long distance your prices will be that much higher. Bring your cell! The hotel has a few restaurants and we dined at Quinn's, a casual sports bar offering adult sandwiches (no pb&j on the menu, though I am certain they would oblige if requested) such as the marinated skirt steak on a ciabatta roll which I had and a very fat pastrami sandwich selected by a friend. They had a wide assortment of appetizers and some nice main dish salads and the requisite soup for a seaside community, clam chowder. Prices were about what you would expect in a city hotel, with the chowder at $8.00 for an average sized bowl. Food was well prepared. As a full-service hotel, in-room dining is also offered, but be prepared for the food prices to be pumped up with Sheraton's version of thinking of its patrons' comfort (tongue in cheek here). The in-room menu reads "For your convenience a 19% service charge and a $3.00 delivery charge will be added automatically." However, if this is not a determent then a very nice selection of foods is offered. Aside from a bank of computers in the lobby available to guests without charge, we did not use any of the other commercial offerings, but I did investigate what was available A "Smart Office" is set up with a computer, printer, speaker phone, scanner, fax etc. at $75.00/hr. This room is described as being appropriate for small meetings and interviews and has a capacity for up to four people. They have a spa and fitness center for a $10.00 daily fee for hotel guests. Various spa treatments are available and the center is equipped with cardiovascular equipment and body machines. Neither a hair salon nor manicurist was in the list of services. There is a small store selling the usual hotel merchandise and snacks but don't expect to find any semblance of solid nutrition (a bagel, for instance) there. Again, they want you in their restaurants so they can sell that bagel for $6.00. Everyone we met at this hotel, from check-in personnel, to wait staff, to maintenance, was extraordinarily nice. Apparently Sheraton takes the time to select and train its people and it shows. No complaints there! Beware of their parking arrangement. They charge $20/day for hotel parking, more for valet. An adjacent open lot charges $4.00 per hour and the charges just keep accruing. Check before you park so you won't be surprised. In conclusion, this is a pleasant place to stay, especially for the business traveller. The property is smart, food is good, and the location is great.

<Title>“Excellent! Superb service.”
<Content>I absolutely loved my stay here. Some have noted the proximity of the airport. This did not bother me. What makes this hotel one of the best i've ever stayed at? it's the people. the service was beyond compare. for example, i arrived after 24 hours of travelling to find that i hadn't booked to arrive that day but the next day. however they assured me they'd take care of me, and gave me a room - at the special conference rate, which they didn't need to do as the special rate actually only started the next day. everyone referred to me by name, and when i returned from sightseeing or shopping, the concierge would ask how my day went. little touches. my wish was their command (or so they made me feel)... there was a one cup brewer in my room to make a cup of starbucks coffee if i wanted. there was a beautiful airy breakfast room, with a view of the harbour, and the friendliest staff starting your day with their smiles and upbeat service. to me this matters a lot. i never take the US style customer service for granted - if you've lived or travelled in europe you'll understand. the bed must be mentioned. i have never slept on such a comfortable hotel bed before - with a choice of pillow types and the most comfortable linen and duvet. i took a taxi downtown, but figured out how to use the bus and trolley system for getting around and back to the hotel... which saved a lot of money. i attended a conference here which was great fun and the hotel, once again, made it memorable.

<Title>“Liked this Hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina from 12/25-12/31. In general, we were very pleased with the hotel. From the outside, it looked very nice. It was very close to the airport, so that was convenient as well. We did frequently see and hear planes going overhead every few minutes. It didn't bother us at all, but others might be more sensitive to that. The plane noise never disturbed us during the night either. The hotel room was nice. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The rug seemed a little bit worn, but that wasn't a big deal. We had a balcony over looking the pool area. In the evening, they often had hot cider in the lobby. I thought that was a nice touch. The only thing I didn't like about the hotel was the computer availability. It was great that they offered free internet use, however, they only had about 6 computers for hundreds of guests. Most of the time they weren't even all in service. That was frustrating! Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel. It was clean, conveniently located, and affordable. If we head back out to San Diego in the future, we will definitely consider staying here again.

<Title>“Great views, close to airport”
<Content>I recently spent one night here after disembarking from a cruise. For what I was looking for, the hotel was perfect. It is just a few blocks from the airport, and is convenient for folks heading out of town. The location on Harbor Island is very pretty, and there are gorgeous views of downtown and the marina from many of the rooms. When we arrived, our room was dirty but we were quickly upgraded to a Club Level room. The room itself was nice, if not spectacular. The continental breakfast that is one of the "Club Level" perks was great - no complaints and pretty much a real breakfast. We paid $105 per night on Priceline for the hotel. If you are staying in San Diego for an extended period of time/vacation, I'm not sure I would recommend this hotel, just because of the location. You can't really walk to anything, and if you are running around the city, cab fare would probably add up. That said, you would probably do fine with a rental car here, since most of the downtown attractions are very close.

<Content>I just spent a few nights at the Sheraton Harbor Island and had a very nice time. The Hotel lobby was very nice and the staff VERY helpful. The rooms were nice, but could use a little updating, but overall quite nice. The pools looked great, we only ate at Quinns, the food was good (its like a sports bar) but it was quite loud. Overall we had a great time and would definitley go back.

<Title>“Awful”
<Content>I just got back from four nights at this hotel, and it was terrible. When I checked in, the room I was sent to was not clean. It clearly had not been vacuumed in some time, and there were shoe prints in the dirt on the bathroom floor. The woman at the front desk was very nice, and I switched to a different room. It turns out the second room was on the "airport" side. Clearly the noise would have been less had the sliding door to the balcony sealed, which it did not, letting in breeze, noise and airplane exhaust. When I asked in the morning if I could switch to the other side, I was told I had been moved up to a "deluxe" room, as though I was lucky to be there. (It was the same size room, two floors up. "Deluxe" must have meant "vacuumed".) The burger I ordered medium well from room service was completely raw inside, the shower only gave lukewarm water, dishes piled on carts in the hall remained there all day, and the room was never vacuumed through my stay. If I had not been staying for a conference, I certainly would not have stayed. It is a shame- I have stayed at the same hotel several times, beginning nearly 20 years ago. It is a nice property, but there if I wanted a hotel where you feel you have to wear your shoes all the time, I would have stayed somewhere cheaper.

<Title>“Don't stay here - too noisy!”
<Content>Horribly noisy hotel. You would think that a hotel across the street from the airport would have noise remediation but the walls were even thinner than usual. The decor is nice, and the staff is friendly and efficient, but you will not get any sleep here. The views of the harbor from both sides are utterly destroyed by the noise of the airplanes. You also hear everything your neighbors are doing (I mean, EVERYTHING). Not pleasant. My room smelled of body odor that wasn't mine. I was not able to get any sleep at all. Most egregious was the energy-efficient thermostat. You could only manually get the fan to blow on high for five minutes, then it switches automatically to "auto." So, no hope for white noise to drown out the other noises.

<Title>“We loved this hotel!”
<Content>We stayed at this property because of the proximity to the starting line for the San Diego International Triathlon, which we had friends participating in. I am a Starwood Preferred Member and at arrival I was told by the Starwood Rep that I was the Guest of the Day. I was given free parking and an upgrade to the Club Level which included a cocktail reception and free continental breakfast. This was just an added bonus. The hotel it beautifully decorated, the staff was friendly and helpful. The room was very comfortable. The hotel is very close to the airport but noise was not a problem. This would make it convenient who may have a layover. I would definately recommend this hotel. We couldn't have had a better stay!

<Title>“Outstanding!!”
<Content>Stayed four nights for a conference. The hotel is directly across Harbor Drive from the airport. There was some airport noise, but from my room it was minimal. I highly recommend that someone planning to stay here sign up for the Starwood Preferred Guest program as they seem to provide a whole floor for members. I really liked getting the two liters of complementary water every day--beats paying the normally exhorbitant prices! They also had coffee and tea in the elevator lobby on this floor. A nice touch. I stayed in the East tower in a corner room furthest from the airport, which partly explains the low aircraft noise. I had a balcony overlooking San Diego harbor and was able to watch the sun set over Point Loma as well as watch ships coming in and leaving from the Pacific. Pretty cool. Beds were very comfortable, the cleaning staff wonderful and the downstairs staff very friendly and approachable. Parking is a bit steep, but I believe it is true anywhere downtown. Took five minutes to get to the freeways, maybe ten to get to Gaslamp Quarter. Overall a great stay and I highly recommend it!

<Title>“"This is not a soccer hotel" our daughter said!”
<Content>Our family travels to San Diego frequently for Club soccer tournaments. Usually, we stay in "Hotel Circle", since we usually are travelling w/ 16-20 other families & those hotels usally offer the best group rates. THIS year though, we were fortunate enough to get a competitive rate here at the Sheraton ($120 a night + tax) and loved it! Some of our team had the cottage style rooms facing the small marina. This is great. for those families that don't like the feel of a large hotel. We were lucky enough to have a room on the 7th floor with fantastic city views, views of Coronado bridge, the cruise ships, the harbor, the aircraft carriers, and incoming planes! yes, there was some slight noise from planes taking off but since we usually stay in chaotic hotel circle, this noise didn't bother us & our 9 yr. old daughter was entertained for hours watching planes land and take off. The front desk was very helpful. The concierge was even better! The girls there helped us find a nearby restaurant that wasn't over run with tourists & could handle a crowd within an hour. They called ahead & made reservatiosn for us twice, were very knowledgeable about locations & streets and were quick to hand us detailed maps & highlighted our driving directions. We highly reccomend the main restaurant for breakfast especially...that was the only meal we ate there & it was really fresh and worth the hotel price. It felt very decadent over looking the marina. Served on contemporary dishes, it made the toast even look gourmet!! It was great tasting, very fresh and the service was friendly. We definitely will return to this hotel in the future. Tcleary

I was very surprised...first of all, they put us in the West Tower, which is farthest away from the airport. The room had a beautiful marina view, and the furnishings were great. The bed wad very comfortable and the room was good sized. I would definitely stay here again, especially for the price.

<Title>“Excellent hotel”
<Content>I stayed here three nights after a cruise. Was given room 5207 in the Lanai area. This is a four storey building connected to the East Wing and has its own pool and hottub. This is a very nice hotel. The gardens and pool areas are beautiful. You have the marina on one side and the harbour on the other. A free shuttle takes you to the airport and from there you can take the bus downtown. The walk to the airport only takes 5 - 10 minutes. I paid US$119 per night for single occupancy (total $402.86 including taxes) . Lobby has free internet computers. Buffet breakfast was $21. Expensive but excellent. I would certainly stay here again. andrew

<Title>“All around great hotel”
<Content>My husband and I just returned from a four night stay at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. We had no trouble locating the hotel shuttle bus at the airport and were assisted with our bags by a very friendly and helpful driver. Upon reaching our reserved room in the east tower we discovered that we were not given the king bed we had requested. A call to Thomas at the front desk was all it took to be reassigned a beautiful 7th floor room in the west tower. My husband and I expected a certain amount of airport noise but we were delighted to find that the room was actually quiet and peaceful. The room was very clean, updated, and comfortable with a fantastic water view. One morning we enjoyed the delicious breakfast buffet overlooking the harbor and met with friends in the evening on the outdoor patio for drinks and a light supper. Service seems to be a priority at this property, both in the restaurants and the hotel itself. The shuttle drivers were exceptional, very informative, and cheerful. The desk staff and even the housekeepers always greeted us with a smile. We felt as though we were special guests during our stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>we stayed here for 5 nights [tue to sunday] in oct07 and loved it. got a room in west tower on 7th floor. had a view of the bay and planes landing [no the noise was not that bad!] staff was GREAT in every way. internet in lobby free for 45 minutes each time you log in, lots of people use it. pool and hot tub were very clean,etc and felt great. ate at the sports bar a couple of times and service was very good and the view of the boats was nice. ate breakfeast at a local deli called Papananis between West and East towers every morning with the "locals". Very good food and good prices. Was a great way to start our day. Parking was $20/day with in/out access. The parking was billed on our room bill. Booked thru Expedia and room rate was discounted a LOT because we stayed 5 days. We were VERY pleased with the 5 day rate! Hotel is so close to attractions that driving was never a issue as in 20 minutes we could be to most trourist spots. We would come back anytime!!

<Title>“Not quite what you pay for”
<Content>Just finished a 3 night stay here for a conference. My room was clean, very comfortable bed, a work desk and a small couch. Nice but really not that different from, say, a Courtyard Mariott. Yes it is near the airport and you can hear the airplanes, but it didn't bother me. Shuttle bus runs every 15 minutes or so to the airport, but if you are travelling light, the weather is good and don't mind a 20 - 30 minute walk that is actually dooable. I jogged each day around harbor island and that was great - there are numerous park benches to sit and enjoy the views of the bay and downtown. The gym is in the East tower, and is a good 5 minute walk from the west tower where I stayed and is an extra charge, even for guests. They call it East and West tower, but really they are pretty much 2 completely seperate properties. Internet access is extra, like $11 or so a day. In summary, a good hotel with convenient airport access in a beautiful location, but in all a little pricey for what you get and typical of full service hotels, you have to pay for extras like gym and internet access (no free continental breakfast here)

We were automatically upgraded to a suite overlooking the marina. Our room was spacious, the bathroom was on the smaller side & we had a flat screen TV. The room was clean & staff was courteous. We didn't experience too much airport noise even though it is in close proximity. If we'd paid more I would have expected a lot more.

<Title>“They should rename to Airport Sheraton”
<Content>I stayed two nights at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. They should rename this hotel to the Airport Sheraton because you are RIGHT NEXT TO THE AIRPORT. Don't get me wrong, the hotel was nice inside, but if you are outside by the pool or restaurant, you hear the planes taking off every couple of minutes. I mean LOUD! They had a jamaican band playing by the pool to drown out the airplane noise but it still was LOUD. Not very relaxing by the pool. And if you have your balacony door open (which I like to sleep with the door open at night instead of air conditioning), then expect the noise from the airplanes. The hotel lobby was nice, the bed was very comfortable and the concierge level was nice too. Not excellent but just nice. I wouldn't stay here again. It would work more as a business hotel close to the airport but definitely not a weekend pleasure trip.

<Title>“Not what I had hoped for.”
<Content>We stayed at this Sheraton in Aug 2007. I do not think it is as nice as other Sheratons we have stayed in. The place is huge and upon first entering our room everything looked clean and very nice. After taking a shower I was disgusted to find I picked up hair balls on my feet walking from the bathroom to the bed. Quite a chunk of hairball, I might add. Sometimes a "rotten egg" odor would come from the bathroom and hang around for about 15 minutes. I assume the order came from the sink drains or bath drain. We could hear every word the people in the adjoining rooms were saying. Oddly, we could not hear the typical banging of hotel doors. The elevators worked very well. This is a huge hotel and whoever takes care of the elevators should be congradulated. The self parking worked ok. I believe it is $20 per night. The parking attendants let you in, then let you out. This is fine in a location where parking fees are normally steep anyway. The hotel looked very clean and we had a balcony room on a high floor with a good view. A few days after we checked out I received a master card charge for about $4.50 for a bottle of drinking water we did not open in the room. All in all, I will go back to staying at the Best Western on Harbor Drive. The parking there is free, the quick breakfast there is free, there are balcony view rooms, I can pick up the same hairballs on my feet, and I have never been charged for services I did not order. And the Bestwestern is probably half the price.

<Content>Nice nautical decor in the West Tower. Beds very comfortable, but only double size. The room was very spacious and had a perfect view of the harbour. Of our 2 week trip of travelling, this was my families' favorite hotel. The pool was warm and big enough to handle several visitors. The hotel staff was very helpful in recommending and finding some restaurants we wanted to go to.Check out the Boat House Restaurant in walking distance of the hotel (near the Hilton). They have daily specials. For example, the lobster dinner is $11.95 on Wednesdays. We got a great deal on our room through San Diego Central Reservations at 1-800-434-7894. We were flying home from San Diego, so this hotel was in a great location. You couldn't get much closer to the airport than this hotel - a 2 minute drive. Surprisingly, being this close to the airport was not a problem. Did not notice noise from the plane traffic. We would definitely, stay at this hotel again.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>I have stayed at this property several times and each time my stay has been great. I have not had any trouble with airport noise and the accomodations are far superior to what I would expect of a Sheraton. Every hotel staff person that I encountered was friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel highly. If you are not traveling for business, the location is a bit secluded and you will need to take a cab into the downtown area as it is several miles to walk there and you would need to walk on a busy street. If you rent a car, the parking fees at the hotel are a bit steep as well. Overall, excellt experience!

<Title>“Nice stay”
<Content>The Sheraton Hotel and Marina was a wonderful hotel. It is located close to the airport so it was quick and easy to get to after our flight. There were planes flying overhead, but it didn't bother us. The hotel is in a great location. Downtown is 5 minutes away and the 1-5 is 5 to 10 minutes away so you had quick access to all the major attractions (ie Sea World (great) and Coronado Island (lovely)) The rooms are well designed and maintained and the best part is the Sheraton sleeper bed.

<Title>“Customer Service Lacking, lovely hotel grounds”
<Content>This hotel is perfect if you're traveling for business and attending a conference. It is far from perfect if you are traveling for pleasure/vacation. My boyfriend and I were visiting San Diego for a wedding and decided to book through hotwire.com. We landed the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. I had read reviews on trip advisor that the west tower had bigger, updated rooms but was further from the action and that the east tower was closer to everything but with smaller "lanai" rooms. When we arrived at the hotel (east tower) we were told that we were actually staying in the West Tower. I asked to be switched to an East Tower high room but was told that the hotel was overbooked and I should be happy I even have a room! (Nice, right?). So we drove over to the west tower, parked the car ($20 per night!), and unloaded our bags to find out that we were actually staying at the east tower. So we had to gather our things back to the car and drive over to the east tower where we were basically ignored to find our way to our room without any help with our luggage. The lack of organization and service was very disappointing. There was a large Enterprise convention going on at the hotel and it seems the staff was too busy helping those on business to help us out. We were given a subpar Lanai room on the 2nd floor with a less than stellar view. There is no safe in the room and water is $4.00. The room itself was standard. One of the restaurants was closed while we were there for the Enterprise convention. A cab ride to the Gaslamp district was about $15.00 with tip. The pool at the east tower is really nice. We never had to worry about finding a lounge chair and the view of the harbor is beautiful. At check out we were charged for 4 nights of parking even though we only had a car for one night. Ultimately I felt that the money we saved by booking through hotwire would have been better spent on a hotel closer to downtown. I will not stay here again and do not recommend it to travelers. I would recommend the hotel to people looking for a conference spot.

<Title>“Wonderful Experience(Don't uderstand the bad reviews!)”
<Content>First of all I want to say that I cannot believe some of the totally negative reviews that have posted recently. It's almost like these travelers were staying at a different hotel... My husband and I took our two kids (12 & 14) for a 6 night stay at the beginning of July. We love San Diego, and this was our 4th stay at The Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. My 14 year old son chose to return here for his Middle school graduation gift as he & his sister always have a great time. I had actually contacted the hotel in response to the general---We looking forward to seeing you--- email that you receive after booking on the Hotel website. I addressed the email to Robert Cartwright, the Hotel's General Manager telling him that we would be returning and the reason for our visit, and to request a Marina/pool view room. I had booked a Club Level room in the East Tower as we truly enjoy the Club Lounge and the great views that it offers. I actually prefer the rooms over in the West Tower as they are larger, have a bigger balcony and I like their nautical theme, but there is no Club Level in the West Tower. After sending the email with my room request, I received a l reply from Mr. Cartwright.I was truly impressed by this very personal touch, but that was just the beginning! I checked in at the Starwood Preferred Guest check- in area, while my family waited outside with the car. I was told that we had a 2 rooms reserved for six nights, and I said there must be some mistake as I had actually only reserved one room. As it turns out, Mr. Cartwright really took great care of us. He gave us 2 adjoining rooms on the 9th floor, and while the 9th floor is not on the Club Level as I had reserved, the rooms are basically the same and we still had access to the Club Lounge. My kids were over the moon that they got there own room! It truly made our stay so much more comfortable to have that extra space for the week. We were also given complimentary valet parking for the duration of our stay! Now, I know some of you are probably thinking, of course after this special treatment I am going to give the hotel a great review, but if you knew me you would know that would not alter my judgment in anyway. It wasnâ€™t just the way that Mr. Cartwright made us all feel that made this such a great trip, but also many other members of the staff, from the front desk, to the wait staff, the concierge desk, the valet parking staff and bell hops, the gym staff, the bartenders, even the housekeeping and maintenance personnel. Every single hotel employee that we encountered were happy, friendly and truly accommodating people. And in my opinion, it is the people that are employed by a hotel that truly make a difference between a wonderful hotel stay and a so-so experience. You can be in the most luxurious hotel suite, in the most incredible location, but if the service and hospitality are not 5 star you are not going to be happy! We never had a bad meal at the hotel. The kids loved room service and food from Shoreline. the poolside restaurant. My husband and I liked Tapatini, and we all liked the Sunday brunch at Harborâ€™s Edge. Some meals we charged to the room and some we paid cash for so the hotel bill didnâ€™t feel quite so bad at the end of our stay. But like the MasterCard commercials say â€œQuality time with your family, Priceless!â€� We took some great walks along the harbor in the morning, but my favorite part of the day was sitting on the balcony with a glass of wine just gazing at the sunset over the marina. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone just based on the staff alone. We will definitely be returning to the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina on our next trip to San Diego. p.s. Another wonderful thing about this and many other hotels in the Starwood hotel group is that they welcome small dogs; but please if you are going to bring along your pet, only do so if you can trust your pet to be well behaved, that it wonâ€™t make a â€œmessâ€� in the room, wonâ€™t bark at all hours and you as the dogâ€™s caretaker take full responsibility for cleaning up after their walks. It is a privilege to be able to have your dog along, please donâ€™t abuse that privilege!

<Title>“Best Hotel Experience Ever”
<Content>Long story short I loved my stay so much this is what I emailed to Sheraton directly: I recently stayed at your hotel for a 5 night 6 day conference that was taking place at the San Diego Convention Center. I must say that this hotel is the best hotel I have EVER stayed in my entire life. I've stayed at a many places in New York, Rome, Chicago, Florida, Newport etc everything from the Millineum in Manhattan to the Ritz in Sarasota. From the moment we got there by the Sheraton airport shuttle our stay was magnificent. I brought my girlfriend with me on this business trip because I had a feeling it would soon turn to pleasure. Everything about your hotel is fantastic. The gigantic pool(s) is amazing and the courtesy of the serving staff out there is impeccable. Particularly a guy named Steve working at the Shoreline resteraunt. That guy had the whole place smiling and laughing. The Harbor Inn Resteraunt breakfasts were some of the best Ive had in awhile. Quinns was excellent. The best martinis and the food was great. The room was perfect maid service perfect. The ladies at the Concierge Desk were the most polite people I think Ive ever met! They were such a great help! Overall, my girlfriend and I could not believe the outstanding service that we were experiencing for 6 DAYS IN A ROW. Everyone of the employees was so nice from the gyms guy giving me towels to the wait staff at Harbor Inn to the front desk. Even the security officers asked us if we were alright and needed anything. If I was a freaking millionaire I would live at your hotel. When I come back to San Diego I am DEFINITELY staying at your hotel. Freaking amazing. Your star rating should be waaaaay over than what it is on some of these websites. Thank you for such a great experience. I will never forget it...END MESSAGE. Overall if youre going to San Diego and you book a room here be sure you book it in the East Tower on a high floor. Once you get that covered trust me you'll have no worries the whole time you're there. This hotel is awesome.

<Title>“Great Hotel!”
<Content>Took husband and teenagers to LA for vacation and visited San Diego for 2 days as a side trip. Got excellent price $119.00 night through Sandiego.org....but you have to call into their 1-800 number to get the rate. Stayed in East Tower which was very convenient to everything....The West tower requires a shuttle to get to everything. Beautiful pool area. Was worried about how close the airport was but did not notice air traffic at all. You are not within walking distance to anything at all; that is the only draw back but you are only 3 miles to downtown, gas lamp, etc. Room was very nice...but they do not have refridgerators or microwaves....kind of bare basics but didn't mind for the rate that we paid. Would definitely stay there again and all common areas were beautiful!

<Title>“Never Again!”
<Content>This was quite possibly the WORST stay I have ever experienced and I've stayed in some crap hotels that had a friendly and more knowledgeable staff than this joke of a hotel, not only was our room not ready when we arrived at 6pm, I was treated rudely by the front desk clerk and then he dismissed me to help someone else who got into their room right away. For $509.00 (tax included) a night I expected better service. When my room was ready my room key was tossed on the counter and we weren't even told how to get to it which tower or anything. We then called for a vending machine location were sent on a wild goose chase, never did find it. We called the concierge for a taxi and were told they had them on call and one would be, well we ended up driving our own vehicle, no taxis were available. The laziness of this staff was astonishing! No one at this hotel seemed to be friendly, willing to help or even apologize for their lack of quality service. I will never return to this hotel until changes in staff manners & knowledge of the facility are finally a part of this hotel.

<Title>“Isolated Hotel”
<Content>The hotel is a stone's throw from the San Diego airport. If your room faces the marina, you will hear the planes taking off and the balcony is of not much use due to the constant noise. However, the sliding glass door does a good job of shielding the noise. The lobby decor is in the marine theme and is very inviting. But, the arms on the chairs look pretty dirty even though the fabric was dark blue. I changed my room because the bathroom smelled and the paint was peeling on the bathroom ceiling. The second room was better. Decor is in blues and white with a touch of red. I attended a meeting with work and the food supplied by the hotel was very good - everything they served was tasty. Front staff was friendly and helpful and what you'd expect. The location of this hotel is not the best. It's on Harbor Island and it is very isolated. There is nothing else around there that is interesting. You have to get in your car to really enjoy the San Diego experience. There are a couple of restaurants down the road. I went to one and it's just not very lively around the hotel area. If you're looking for isolation and want to stay on the property, this place is OK if you don't mind jet noise. I'd stay somewhere else in the future that has places to eat, drink, and shop within walking distance, like around Seaport Village. This hotel does the best with what it has, but it can't change its location.

<Title>“Nice place for a vacation.”
<Content>Pretty decent overall. Very attentive staff. The room condition was great...everything was nice and neat. I had a lenai room but it looked directly at a fence surrounding the tennis court. Self parking is $20/night which i thought was steep. Hotel is not within walking distance to anything so it is somewhat like a resort for someone who wants to hang out at the hotel pool and see other San Diego sights by car. The property has a very large feel to it as well.

<Title>“Nice place overall”
<Content>We stayed in a lanai room in the East Tower and it was beautiful.....better than I expected. We were close to the pool and marina - nice view from our balcony. Walking by the water was nice, although you can not walk to "town" or another restaurant. The only negatives for me: can not buy wine/beer in their little gift store, no room safe, had to get in car to go anywhere ($20 a day parking).

<Title>“Like a Resort -- near the airport!”
<Content>Great hotel with a wonderful location. Hotel sits on marina right near the airport. Airport noise is not noticeable though as the hotel is off the flight path. Marina is beautiful with sailboats, yachts, blue water and palm trees. Other side of hotel faces the bay and great views of Coronado Island and passing Navy ships. Room are spacious and comfortable. Rooms seemed newly renovated with nice furniture, tvs and comfortable beds and bedding. Very clean and quiet. Got a very good price on Hotwire. My only negative comment would be in the food category. While the hotel is situated nicely for views, ease to airport, downtown etc. if you do not have a car, you are captive to the hotel restaurant. Prices in the hotel for food were exhorbitant, though food was good. If you have a rental car, this should not be a problem -- just eat elsewhere. Overall a wonderful stay. Pleasantly surprised and would definitely stay here again!

<Title>“Nice Hotel Close to the Airport”
<Content>I attended a conference in the East Tower but chose to stay in the West Tower for the larger nicer rooms. Our room in the West Tower was indeed very nice and quite large, with a nice view of the harbor. The walk to the East Tower is not bad, but it gets kind of old after the second day. The East Tower has larger and nicer pools, dining, and bars, so I would probably stay there in the future, although the West Tower was very quiet. Best part of the hotel is a 5 minute ride (actually less) from the airport. Also nice is that it is a great place for a morning jog around Harbor Island. Worst part is that the on-site restaurants are very expensive and you have to take a cab to go anywhere off the island (actually the city bus passes right in front of the hotel if you are really trying to get downtown cheap).

<Title>“Fine, if you know what you're getting”
<Content>I bid on a 4* hotel on Priceline and received this hotel. Like other reviewers on Tripadvisor, I agree that it is a 3*. We had a room in the East Tower on the 10th floor. The view of the harbor was very nice. The hotel is full service, with several restaurants and a very nice pool. The location is ok. You can't walk to anything, but it's a short drive to many of the attractions in San Diego. However, the room was definitely 3* quality. It was very basic. The toilet seat was peeling, and there were stains on the carpet in the hallway. We were given a club level room with access to the club lounge, which was very nice and elegant with great views. It is located on the top floor and offered breakfast and evening hors d'oevres to club level guests. However, even there, the fabric on some of the chairs was peeling. If you come here expecting a 4* hotel, you will be disappointed. However, if you expect a 3*, it's not so bad.

<Title>“Very good stay”
<Content>After getting this hotel via a Priceline bid and reading the reviews..I was expecting to hate the property. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Originally assigned to the West Tower (told this by the shuttle driver)..I decided to ask for the east tower based on the comments here. I went to the SPQ desk at the east tower and was given Room 706 . It was on the smallish side..but clean with a great marina view. I felt the staff was professional and accomodating and would not hestiate to stay here again.

<Title>“Would Not Stay Here Again..Definiteily Has Its Problems”
<Content>I booked this hotel through Priceline and got a rate of $105/night..That is likely the only positive to my hotel experience at the Sheraton. The con's first -Location (Literally next to the airport..Noise, traffic, and there isn't anything to do in walking distance from the hotel, i.e. restaurants. Like the others before me said, it's a good $15 cab ride one way into 'town') -Parking ($20/day to park in a dirt lot. It wasn't very lit and our car was covered in dirt when we checked out. Also, the lot isn't covered. For $20/day I expected more) -Lack of Clealiness (Hotel wasn't clean..The carpet in the hallways was worn, dirt on the walls, dirty sheets with holes and the bathroom was the worst..There was a TON of black hair in the shower. The vents in the bathroom were coated in a heavy layer of dirt) -No free Wifi or internet in the rooms (They were charging $14 for a 24 hour period for the internet..Ridiculous) -Restaurants (Food wasn't great and was extremely expensive..$14 for eggs in the morning??!!) The pros: -Pool (Pool was nice and they served drinks poolside, located next to the harbor which was great) -Price (If you shop around, you can get a good rate I'm sure..We did on Priceline)

<Title>“Business Hotel”
<Content>I stayed here on business and saw many other business travelers on a conference. I would not recommend this hotel for a family vacation spot. It is literally located 5 minutes from the aiport by shuttle, so you will hear the airplanes landing and taking off all day and night. If you stay here ask for a room with a pool and marina view if not you will be facing the main street with a parking lot view - not pretty at all! I would also ask for a renovated room - the pictures on their website are not like the room I stayed in. My room was very outdated, the rugs needed to be change - dirty and stained. The bedding felt old and the room had very bad lighting. This hotel needs a lesson on cleanliness. I found hair on my bedsheets and in the tub. Also, some type of bug was crawling in the bathroom - yuck! This hotel is also about a $12 cab ride to downtown San Diego where all the shops and eateries are.

<Title>“nice hotel”
<Content>Stayed here for a conference, so my company paid for it. It was great for that purpose. The bar at the hotel was a fun hangout, and the place had great views of the marina. If I was just here for a vacation with my wife we would have stayed somewhere by the beach since my wife likes more boutique style places (and we did actually move to a hotel in la jolla after the conference was over). The reviews here seemed very accurate. pros - big chain hotel, great amenities. I got lucky and had a great view on a high floor of the bay. location wasn't bad, about a $15 cab ride to gaslamp district where most of the nightlife and restaurants are, $15 cab ride to old town for some authentic (in a touristy way) mexican exploration. i think they charge 15 or 20 bucks to park or something like that, but i didn't have a rental car. the hotel has a shuttle that runs to/from the airport. that was nice. cons - i asked for special request of hypoallergenic bedding. they offered to remove all feathers/down and put in an air cleaner in the room. when i got back they had switched the pillows on just 1 of the 2 beds, and stuck the comforter in the corner behind the chair. there were several feathers on the carpet in plain view. well, at least they tried! another thing that bummed me was no free internet and i couldn't get wireless in my room (well, company paid so no big deal) oks - right next to the airport but i didn't hear any noise (i'm sensitive to noise).

<Title>“Most of the stay was good, however...”
<Content>First off, if you book through Hotwire or Priceline, they'll try to put you in something called a "Lanai" room. From all I've heard, you'll want to avoid these rooms...so I called and pleasantly asked to be moved to the west tower....and I was accomodated. That was definitely pleasant. Not pleasant?? 20 bucks for parking. Any great deal you think you're getting because a little less great after that. Overall, the room was nice. The main issue was that I could hear people talking in an adjacent room until after midnight. Since the walls to adjoining rooms were concrete, I have to assume it was a person either above or below me...either way, it was distracting and limited my sleep. We STILL paid 110 bucks for this through Priceline...and if I would have had earplugs, it'd definitely be all worth it.

<Title>“4-star price for 2-star quality”
<Content>I stayed in the West Tower during a 4-day meeting I attended in early June, 2007. Check-in was smooth. My room was spacious but dark. The only light switch controlled a single low-wattage bulb by the door. I had to stumble around in the dark to turn on individual lamps. There were black and brown stains on my sheets when I checked in. I requested that these be changed, and they were replaced with sheets that merely had brown stains and were torn and threadbare. In the bathroom, there had been a leak in the wall behind the toilet, and the wall was moldy with the wallpaper peeling off the wall. There had been no attempt to fix the wall. There was hair in the sink. My impression, based solely on walking through the lobby and attending my meeting, is that the East Tower (a completely separate building) is a much nicer, cleaner, and more updated building. (Note that I did not actually see any of the hotel rooms in the East Tower.) There are many more restaurants, bars, meeting rooms, and business facilities in the East Tower than the West Tower. If I had to attend a meeting at this hotel again, I would stay at the hotel only if I were not personally paying the bill and if I had a room in the East Tower.

<Title>“Pleasantly Surprised”
<Content>Based on previous reviews, when I discovered that this was the hotel assigned to me by Priceline...I was scared! However, I was pleasantly surprised. Check in was smooth. Stayed in a room in the east tower adjacent property. The adjacent section seemed to be a little older then the main lobby building but definitly nicer looking then the outside of the east tower. Room was not extravegant but clean and modern looking. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Sunday brunch was amazing! I'd go back just for the brunch. Walked all around the hotel and the grounds are very nice. Tennis courts, two pools, work out room and a game room kept my kids busy. I actually wished we were staying more then one night so we could enjoy the facilities more. Hotel is right on the marina so you get to enjoy the boats and the water. Excellent location, easy to get to Zoo, Gaslamp district, ect. I would definitly stay here again.

<Title>“OK Stay”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton for 5 nights in May. I was able to book two rooms via Priceline for a good price. When we pulled into the front of the hotel, a valet had a list of all reservations & directed us to the West Tower. This was helpful, as the East Tower's self parking lot is a dirt lot located about a 5 minute walk from the hotel entrance and it would have been an inconvenience to take the kids & luggage out & back in. The West Tower was about a 3 minute drive and located in front of the Marina & Harbor in the back. The check in went smoothly. The staff was helpful and was able to accommodate our need for connecting rooms (one room w/ handicap access) & waived parking fees since we had a disabled car sign. We were given a newspaper every weekday morning and not charged. Both rooms were clean and decorated with the nautical theme. Although the West Tower is away from all the amenities, it had it's benefits...such as larger rooms for the kids to run around, less foot traffic then in the other Tower, further away from the airport , beautiful views & parking (on pavement not, dirt) located in front - never had trouble finding space. We took a look at the East Tower and were annoyed that we couldn't find a space and then, had to park in the dirt lot. It seemed the majority of their guests stayed there since there was a large influx of people going in & out. For us, we didn't plan on using the pool or eating at the nicer restaurants so the West Tower better meant our needs. My only complaint was there was no laundry facility at the West Tower. I would classify the hotel as a three star only because there were standard features missing. Both rooms secondary locks were not working as well as a peephole that had a paper rolled into it. One of the sliding closet doors was not secured at the bottom, which caused the door to swing. For some reason the message light kept blinking. Overall, we enjoyed our stay there and would return. Just a helpful hint for those looking with families looking for a quick meal, you may want to drive to Point Lomos neighborhood (around Nimitz Way & Rosencrans St) about a 10 minute drive to find McDonalds, KFC, Vons, Dennys,Walgreens & cheaper gas stations. We were driving downtown in the evenings for food and encountered traffic so it would take as 20-25 minutes to get downtown and finally, stumbled on this street.

<Title>“There are better hotels in the area”
<Content>This hotel was troublesome from the beginning. Not everything that went wrong was their fault, but they couldn't make anything right. I went there with a colleague to attend a conference. This is a large property and we were put in rooms at opposite ends of the complex. A walk from one end to the other took 17 minutes, mostly outdoors. This wasn't a hardship because the weather was beautiful, but it made it tougher to meet up for breakfast or classes. The problem was that when we checked in, they couldn't find two rooms for us that were closer. The complex consists of several buildings. The East Tower is the most centrally located. There are Lanai rooms that are at one end, and then far away in the other direction is the West Tower. The rooms in the West Tower are bigger, away from everything else, and non-smoking. The conference center was closest to the East Tower. The rooms weren't particularly clean. My colleague's room had a nasty-looking stain on the bedspread. My room had a big stain on the carpet. The rooms that I saw didn't have safes or refrigerators but they did have coffee makers. There was noise from the nearby airport but I expected it to be worse than it was. The staff were uniformly friendly and smiling, but generally not helpful. As a second example, the person at the desk in the West Tower offered to make a dinner reservation for us at a restaurant in the Gaslamp district on a Friday night, but she told me that the restaurant was sold out. We drove down there anyway expecting to find another restaurant, but the restaurant that we wanted was happy to seat us right away. As with so many things, they might not have been responsible but it seemed like they had a hard time doing anything that was actually helpful. None of the doors which were supposed to automatically lock at night ever actually locked. Guests have an odd habit of defeating security measures and maybe that had something to do with it, but apparently the locks weren't working. In reality, we didn't suffer at the Sheraton. The food was good, the drinks and tapas at the bar were generous, and the staff was friendly. But there are so many nicer places to stay in the area that I'd pick someplace else unless there was a really good reason (for example, a conference on the property) to stay at this Sheraton.

<Title>“Not Impressed, expected better from a Sheraton”
<Content>Although the hotel is only a short free shuttle from the airport and the bed is soft and nice, overall I was not too impressed with this hotel. At $250/night (conference discount rate not including tax), the accommodation was only so-so. My garden room was in the Lanai section of the East wing, a very long walk from the lobby; it faced a fence and with the door open you could hear the planes overhead. The door was supposed to be double locked but I could not find the 2nd lock. When I arrived, the problems in the bathroom made it seem like no one had been there for a while: a couple dead bugs on the floor, 2 vials of shampoo but no conditioner, a broken light, the bathroom fan sounded like a rusty helicopter, and low shower pressure-- lots of water came out the bath faucet instead of the through the shower head when the diverter was pulled. It also seemed they were trying to squeeze a dime out of their customers for everything. Examples of the extra charges, which many lower-rate hotels provide no charge or have much better value: - My electronic check-in sheet declared that I would be charged 75 cents for a copy of USA Today outside my door each morning-- and to refuse the paper I should notify the front desk. Despite this notice, I actually never got any papers or charges. - The wired internet charge from the room was high-- if I recall it was ~$8 for 30 minutes and $~14 for 24 hrs, yikes. - To use the exercise room/health club is $10 per day. - Breakfast items in the restaurant are at a high premium. - Bottled water in the room-- if you partake in it, charges you $4/bottle. My friend was staying in the east wing upper floors and she found her room was out of date and the amenities quite chintzy for a hotel that charges $275/night.

<Title>“Four stars? I don't think so”
<Content>I was checked in on the West side building instead of the tower building. The lobby looks more like a 3 stars trying really hard to look nice. The ground floor king bed room that I was given looks old and tired. One of the lamp does not work and while the room is spacious, there are not enough furnitures to fill the room so it looks a bit empty. Asides from the amenities, it is not much better than the average Four Points. The Westin Horton Plaza is a better value and location.

<Title>“We enjoyed this hotel”
<Content>We stayed here for three nights as a family of 4. We were located on the 11 floor of the main tower. Yes, the room was pretty small by most standards, but we managed just fine with 4 people and 4 suitcases. We were living out of the suitcases as we were changing hotels 3 times in total for this trip. The beds were very comfortable. The view was of the marina and the pool - very lovely. The airport was RIGHT there. My husband was bothered by the planes one morning, but we didn't notice them other than that. It was a very convenient location for touring SeaWorld, the Zoo, Downtown. The club lounge was one of the best I've experienced at a Sheraton. The staff were VERY friendly and attentive. We went for breakfasts, but not in the afternoons. We ate at the bar when we arrived the first night - the fried calamari was excellent! Service was very good and friendly. We really all enjoyed our stay here.

<Title>“ok place”
<Content>Stayed for over a week here on business in February 2007. The hotel is split into two towers. Most of the activities are in the East and unfortunately I was in the West. There is only a short walk between them though. Hotel is very very close to the airport and as a result, I found it quite noisy because you could always hear airplanes taking off. Room was fine, a good size and was clean but looked like it could do with some renovation especially in the bathroom. Room service was good and the staff were generally very good.

<Title>“Great Bed!”
<Content>Arrived after midnight with a reservation for the north (remote) tower. Was not looking forward to shlepping our bags over there, etc but no problem. The very gracious desk clerk (lady from upstate NY) changed our room to the main tower. Awoke to a brilliant sunrise and view of downtown over the hotel parking lot. Room had a small balcony. The bed was extremely comfortable and big. Nice soft comforter and plush linens. When I phoned the front desk to advise the shower was only lukewarm, they reversed the parking charge. Enjoyed the upscale breakfast buffet - waited a few minutes on a Saturday a.m. for a window seat and felt we were dining at a yacht club. Impeccable service - a great start that left us fueld for most of the day - a v. good value. Conceriege was lovely with dinner recommendation and reservation. Valet had car up front with luggage loaded after breakfast, ready for us to take off to our destination. It's a great location - didn't have to hunt for it after arriving on a late flight - right across from the airport - and it was a good value at around $200 for the room. Paid a lot more for a lot less in other places. I'm definitely staying here again.

<Title>“Staff was helpful”
<Content>The hotel was a nice hotel in a good location between the marina and San Diego Bay. The hotel should do a better job, however, in letting people know that this hotel is actually divided into two separate towers which are almost a mile away from each other. The room I stayed in was clean and well appointed. The bathroom was a bit dated, but otherwise it was a good room with a balcony overlooking the marina.

<Content>I stayed with my Dad on a quick visit to see my son in the Navy. I booked on-line $109 + tax and was trully surprised at the hotel. It is a 3 star and really nice. The pool area is wonderful and ALL the staff were so nice and pleasant. I would highly recommend this hotel and would book it for my next stay in San Diego. We were given non-smoking and 2 double beds with lots of pillows and a small balcony over looking downtown San Diego. The parking was $17/24 hr, but I was expecting this. They do take pets less than 70 lbs for no additional fee and my dad has a 7 lb companion, so it was great!

<Title>“You get what you pay for!”
<Content>My family and I have just returned from a five night stay at this hotel. I made the mistake of booking this hotel using one of those discount internet services. First and last time I'll do that again. I had put in a request for a 4-star accomodation thinking I would be given a reservation at either the Omni, Hyatt or Intercontinental hotel as shown in their example. But , no...it was the Sheraton Marina and Harbor instead. I was both surprised and disappointed. First of all, this property is NOT a 4-star accomodation, and this booking service should not be falsely advertising it as such. We arrived at almost 1am after a late flight. I had previously called the hotel to request a late arrival guarantee. Don't know if it was the late hour or the fact that I had booked through a discount broker, but the room we were given was on the ground floor. Not only did the noise of the airplanes from the nearby airport wake us up througout the night , but there was also heavy foot traffic outside our door in the busy hallway. One night , we had to listen to noisy teenagers out by the darkly lit pool area off our patio until midnight. Ditto on the self-parking situation. I think that $17 is ridiculous! (To valet park, it was $24 per day.) The lot was dirty, far away and very poorly lit. We were also double-charged by the hotel for the entire stay. Someone else with the same common last name must have gotten free parking! You had to give the lot attendant your room number along with your last name each time you left, so I'm not sure how the mistake kept getting made. Even as we left the lot for the last time, it happen again! Back to the front desk to clear it up. Lastly, the condition of the room was not that impressive. Certainly not 4-star standards. Ants in the bathroom and NEVER enough towels. Three out five nights I had to request (by note and phone) more towels and toiletries to the housekeeping staff. I reminded them that there were four in our party and not two. No newspaper on the first morning as well. San Diego and its weather was great however! The kids had a blast visiting all of the attractions. Also, note that there didn't seemed to be any reasonably priced restaurants on Harbor Island. A Von's grocery store was also a few miles away. Note there's no refrigerator or microwave in the room either. The location of the Sheraton worked for us, but the entire trip I felt deceived by the fact that I had basically stayed at a 3-star accomodation but thought I was paying for something much nicer. I guess in this situation the old adage, "you get what you pay for" holds true. Next time, I will book my hotel directly and not blindly through a discount hotel broker.

<Title>“Convenient Business Hotel”
<Content>It's been about 10 years since I last stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. The good news in the Starwood Brands are starting to merge and Sheratons are starting to feel more like Westons. As a Starwood gold member, I was upgraded. My bed was great and the room appeared to be recently refurbished. For the business traveler, it's hard to beat the convenience of the hotel - although getting anywhere requires the shuttle, a car or cab (and SD cabs are pricey - it's about $10 to the convention center). The staff at the hotel was great. Friendly and very helpful. I called the concierge about a rental car and the Enterprise bus was picking me up 5 minutes later! (another benefit of Enterprise is you can return the car at the hotel - just hand the keys to the front desk). For runners, especially those of us from land-locked locations, the scenery along the island and bay is great. The "north tower" is a bit isolated.

Location - near airport - is convenient for the business traveler, but the beautiful views of downtown San Diego and Coronado make it a great place for holiday makers alike! My room was very beautifully equipped and decorated, bathroom was nice. Really, me and my girlfriend really enjoyed our stay there! Complimentary internet is offered in the lobby, which is great! Pleanty of restaurants and there's also a pub! Three swimming pools, one heated, gym and tennis fields. What could you ask more from a hotel? Maybe not the best hotel in San Diego, but a good 4* indeed! Rating? B+

<Title>“Not as good of a deal as you think...”
<Content>If you are looking for a good deal costwise, don't stay here! We stayed at the hotel during the first weekend in March because got a good deal on Hotwire.com ($134/night). The biggest problem with this hotel is its location. It is located directly across the street from the airport-at times it was difficult to sleep because we could hear planes flying overhead. Its also located away from all of the major attractions, so if you don't have a car, you end up spending a lot of money on cabs. If you do have a car (we rented one for the weekend), you end up paying $17/day to park at the hotel. After paying for transportation, it didn't seem like a good deal at all. The room we stayed in (in the East Tower) was clean, but extremely bare. It clearly had been updated in several years. We did use the spa, which was small, but the service was great. All of the employees we encountered at the hotel, from the front desk to the concierge to the spa staff to the staff at the main restaurants were exceptionally friendly and offered prompt service. The staff was the best part of the experience.

<Title>“Great service!”
<Content>I was thoroughly impressed by my stay at this hotel. The location was very simple to get to from the airport (I could see it upon exiting) and our room had a nice little view of the harbor and boats. It was right off the main street that skirts the harbor and made for easy access to downtown (we had a rental car) and Rt. 5 (the highway that seemed to take us everywhere we wanted to go). The service was impeccable. From the woman who checked us in, to the woman who brought the room service, to the bar tender, to the concierge, to the woman who served us during our business lunch... everyone was friendly and efficient. They brought me things before I knew I needed them. Having the sports bar downstairs was a welcome addition when we came back after a full day and wanted a quick beer. The bar tender allowed us to sample the 2 local beers we were trying to decide between. The room was clean and large enough for 2 of us by far. The internet access in the lobby was also helpful for a quick email check.

<Title>“Isolated but comfortable”
<Content>I stayed here for a meeting. The hotel is close to the airport, but a bit isolated. If you are going here for a conference, it is probably so the organizers want you to stay put and not travel around too much. The hotel has two towers, one about a 1/2 mile from the other. The airport shuttle is convenient and free. Check in was courteous and professional. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I am a Starwood preferred guest, so I received a larger room on one of the top floors. The room was decorated very beachy, and the view of the Marina is great. My room was clean, and I received 2 free bottles of water upon check-in. The free soaps and shampoo are of high quality. I ordered room service one night. It was delivered within 15 minutes and probably the best gnocchi I have ever eaten. You will have to take a cab from this hotel to see any sights, but the hotelâ€™s shuttle will drive you down the street if youâ€™d like to get dinner at one of the pricier restaurants. The hotel bar and restaurant is very expensive, but good. Room service tacked on incredible price hikes. Overall, I enjoyed it. I wouldnâ€™t stay here if I was a tourist though. A hotel in downtown where you could walk around would be more fun. I did, however, enjoy a mile long run along the ocean in front of the hotel.

<Title>“Lovely common areas, dirty rooms”
<Content>This was one of the worst hotel experiences in my life. This hotel has two separate buildings, the east and west towers. When I checked in at the west tower, the clerk was uneducated in the hotel's computer system. As the west tower is the less busy of the two, there was no one to help him and we had to wait about 30 minutes to complete the check in. This would have been nothing more than an annoyance, but the check in was not correct. When we drove to the other building to go to our room, we discovered that our room was in the old section of the hotel, about a 1/4 of a mile walk through a maze of hallways in the hotel complex. I am not exaggerating. I counted steps. I booked my travel through Priceline as an experiment, a mistake that I never will repeat. This hotel was listed and promised as a 4 star hotel. The hotel clearly treats Priceline customers like second-class citizens, but Priceline does not warn you of this fact. When we finally arrived at out room, the carpet was dirty, not just worn, the bathroom was rusty, vents were missing from the closet doors and there was one bed, although the check in clerk had supposedly booked in two queens. The room was a step down from a Motel 8. To the bellhops credit, he switched our room to an "upgraded" room for free, and he at least tried to help. We moved rooms to the main tower and were greeted by dirty (stubbed out cigarettes) hallways and our room was again dingy with beaten up furniture, a desk that was literally falling apart, lamps that had no working bulbs, etc. After settling in and unable to find a floor vending machine for a bottle of water, I decided to pay the $ 4.00 for the hotel's room bottle, only to find that the bottle had been previously opened! Yuck! I called the front desk to assure that the water would not be charged to me, and she comped me another bottle, but the fact that the bottle was not checked should tell you the level of cleaning in the hotel. In addition to the gross room, and I swear to the big G on this, our toilet actually backed up. I believe that the hotel maintenance staff knew that there was a problem with the toilet before we checked in because the lid was not fully on the toilet when we got in the room. All in all this was a disgusting experience. If the room had not already been paid for through Priceline, I would have switched hotels. I WILL NEVER STAY AT A SHERATON AGAIN.

<Title>“A pleasant experience all the way around”
<Content>When we arrived at this hotel, we were pleasantly surprised. We had just come from the Westin Bonaventure in L.A. and after staying in that run-down hotel for the majority of out California vacation, we wished we had stayed in San Diego the whole time! The lobby is nice and fresh and the check in staff was very helpful. At first we were put in a room without much of a view and all it took was a friendly call down to front desk and they happily moved us (we did check in on a weekday so it may not have been very booked). The view wasn't perfect because of how the hotel is angled, but it was nice. The room was clean and the bathroom wasn't huge but it was nicer than at the Bonaventure. I can't remember what the name of the room was, but it was on one of the top two floors, so it came with access to the penthouse club, which served breakfast in the morning and hors d'oeuvrs before diner (but get there early!). The internet access seemed a little pricey at $15, but I think there is free access to internet in the penthouse club. The bar there is nice and friendly. I met a lot of nice people while staying here and I had a blast.

<Title>“Very pleasant first time stay”
<Content>The hotel is located directly across from the airport. Parking choices are Valet $24/day or Self-Park (uncovered and short distance) for $17/day...both can be charged to your room with in-n-out privileges. We checked in very late - and our options were 2 beds in the "main" tower - or - a king (what we requested) in the other tower. We were tired - we took the 2 bed room in the main tower. It worked out - our room had a balcony that overlooked a harbo where MANY boats are moored (sp?) It overlooked the outdoor pool and walking trail or sidewalk. It was a very nice view. I think we were in room 1034. Our room had a connecting door to the next room - you could hear people loud and clear in the morning. I'm not sure if they were extra loud or the walls were paper thin (or the noises came through the clearance below the door). The bed was SO comfortable - it is my 2nd favorite bed behind the "Cloud 9" Westin bed in Oklahoma City. Bathroom was up to date and clean. We didn't try internet access. The magazines in the room were helpful - it even had a coupon for Harbor cruises that helped. The concierge (sp?) also has coupons and maps - stop by to see him/her. We stopped by the bar for one drink - it seemed nice. We didn't use any othe shop/cafe/restaurant in the main tower. The "other" tower was just 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile down the road - I'm sure it would have been fine. We did not use a taxi - but the concierge mentioned that it would cost @ $10 to go 4 miles (one way) over to the Marriott hotel (where our friends were) by the convention center. There are some parking meters near the tourist spots - they tend to run $.25 for 12 minutes - and there is a parking garage by the Nimitz aircraft carrier museum. Just thought I would toss that in in case you are trying to decide whether to rent a car or whether to take a taxi to your locations. We would definitely stay here again. We felt like we got a good price for the type of accomodations we received.

The city in the background and the sail boats in the harbor. The walk to the East Tower is nothing. We love it here and when we visit San Diego again, we will stay here. We got our room direct with the hotel and used our Entertainment card.We paid $179 a night for a Deluxe room, High Floor, Harbor View. You can't get a better deal in San Diego!

<Title>“Definitely deserves a return visit”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina for a 5-night stay during a conference held at the hotel in October. The hotel is located on Harbour Island and comprised of 2 towers: the East Tower being the larger and original tower; the West Tower being the smaller but newer tower. After reading the review on Trip Advisor, I made sure to request a room in the newler West Tower. (It turned out to be the better choice since the conference was held in the same tower!). Here's a run-down of my experience: Shuttle - very prompt and efficient. The shuttle runs regularly between the 2 towers and the San Diego airport (5 minutes away). I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the shuttle also drives guests to nearby restaurants on the island and if not available, the bellboy will drive you in the hotel's fleet of Town Cars. Check in - I arrived at 11am on an early flight in and was expecting to have to stow my luggage in storage until the standard check-in time of 3pm. They, however, had my room ready and upgraded me to a larger deluxe room on a higher floor. Staff were very helpful and courteous. Room - paid $259 USD / night which included the buffet breakfast (more on this later). The room had 1 king bed, a sofa, and desk. The room was extremely spacious but the washroom was a little cramped. Room was spotless and had a balcony overlooking the harbour. Housekeeping came daily and was finished before 11am. West tower - newly renovated but while it was the farther tower from the airport, you could still hear the planes coming and going. The West Tower has only 1 restaurant and a small gym but it is much brighter and quieter than the East Tower. The East Tower is a mere 5 minute stroll along the marina or a 2 minute bus ride. Seriously, people who say the walk is long must not get much exercise! There is also free WiFi access in the hotel lobby but you must have your own wireless-equipped laptop to use (otherwise, head to the web bar in the lobby of the East Tower) Gym - very small but was never crowded. Equipped with 1 elliptical machine, 2 treadmills, 2 exercise bikes, free weights, and mats. Water cooler provided, too. Breakfast buffet - trek on over to the East Tower for the buffet. It's well worth the $$!! Plenty of fresh fruits, cereal, hot foods, and a made-to-order omlette bar. Location - very convenient...a 10 minutes ($15 USD) cab ride away to Horton Plaza in the downtown core. Beautiful views of the downtown skyline and marina. Overall, I would return to the Sheraton. Excellent service, great quality, and not outrageously expensive prices.

<Title>“worst starwood service on west coast”
<Content>booked for a precruise stay 2 doubles on clubfloor on a weddingpackage at 269 usd ++.it consisted of cheeseplastter wine breakfast and clubfloor/loungeacces. at checkin, fastlane for spg members still took 15minutes. room average/old but nice view no cheese/wine or whatso ever in the room. after complaints to 2 managers we find met in the elevator, they would do something about it. they never heard about this so called new package (even asked are you married...??yes in the netherlands 2 men can....) but who cares you guys are selling this package or... Cheese arrived at 9pm.and yes there is free wireless in the clubfloorrooms. however the hotel is so outdated only fiited with uspluggs/outlets. get yourself an addapter right. sure thats 9 uss.....service?/renting....no/goldmember/clubfloor??? Well lets do a relaxing drink in the nicely decorated lounge. offcourse you will find some louzy snacks but all alcoholic drinks are charged. 3 cocktails at 40uss.....first starwood lounge where you are charged for drinks... needless to say that the parking at 16uss was charged on both rooms, for 1 car. oeps... 1 good thing to mention breakfast is great and service by brian perfect. never again. such a calculating hotel. i guess its just precruise/postcruise and some conventions. make quick cash.

<Title>“If you are looking for quiet, don't look here”
<Content>I am a local San Diegan and had planned a birthday Saturday for my husband. We rented a sailboat out of the Harbor very near the Sheraton. The plan was to go to dinner after sailing and spend a nice evening at the Sheraton. A friend of mine had worked there for years when it was called the Sheraton Grande. I attended her wedding there years ago and it was lovely. Apparently they hotel forgot to upgrade. We only spent one night, but believe me that was enough. It was difficult to book only one night, Saturday night. So when I got a rate of $259.00, I took it. The hotel is an older style and must be at least 45 years old. The ceilings are not very high and the lobby is modest for a Sheraton. Approaching the front entrance, loud pop music was playing. Almost like the hotel was going for a Las Vegas feeling. Our room was modest and it appeared all the rooms had a nautical theme, which was fine. The room had a magnificint view of The San Diego Bay. The trouble started when we found our room and noticed we were located closed to the elevator. The hotel being so old, every time the elevator went up or down, we heard it. When the elevator stopped on our floor, a bell rung. That was't a problem until we wanted to get some sleep. We went to bed about 11:30 p.m. but did not sleep. Apparently there were three or four funtions at the hotel. From around 12:00 until 2:15 a.m. the functions ended and throngs of people got in the elevator and went back to their rooms. When they stopped on our floor, the bell would ding and drunk loud guests would proceed to exit the elevator and yell and sing right at our door. I woke up at least ten times. At 2:00 am, we almost packed our bags and went home, since we live locally. The Hotel is so old, you can hear when anyone in the area flushed their toilet. The toilet sounded like an airplane toilet, does the job great but you'll know the habits of everyone in rooms around you. If you can avoid the hotel do it. Even though the view is spectacular, you'll have to catch up on your sleep it you don't.

<Content>Expected more from Sheraton. The room did not have a fridge or minibar and in general the room was very basic. No facilities to get changed at the swimming pool and could not find a shower either. For a 4 stars hotel I would expect more.

<Title>“Nice Business Travelers Hotel”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel in Mid-September for a conference. Arrived on a beautiful Saturday afternoon well before the 3PM check-in time and was able to get into my room immediately. I found the rooms in the West Building to be very nice and much nicer and larger than those of the East Building. The room & bathrooms were clean and well laid out. Although you have to walk a short distance to get to any conference events, the views of the city and bay more than make up for it. It is also much quieter in the West Building. I did notice that if you leave your sliding door open or ajar that it will effect the operation of the air conditioner. My wife and I thorougly enjoyed our stay.

<Title>“Overall A Good Value.”
<Content>We booked our room through Hotwire. When you do that they automatcally put you in the East Tower. While the East Tower seem larger we were told by a friendly reservation rep that the West Tower was newly remodeled and much nicer. Our room was fantastic. A nice size with a king bed and balcony. It had a couch and desk as well. we spent little time in the room but when we were there we always had the slider to the balcony open to expose the great Marina view from our window. We had a slight problem with the TV not wanting to stay on any channels for more than a few minutes, making watching a futile excersize. Housekeeping did forget to restock our coffee and towels one day but they quickly brought what we were missing. On checkout the frontdesk offered us a $25 discount on our stay for the TV situtation. We paid $150/night through hotwire and we felt like we got a deal. What really irritates me is how much hotels are charging you to park now. It was $22 a night with valet service or $18 without. Since there is no other parking available what choice do you have? Overall we enjoyed our stay and had a great time In San Diego!

<Title>“It's a Corporate Hotel!”
<Content>My wife attemded a conference here so I tagged along for the two night stay. Once you accept the fact that this is a corporate hotel and that it's close to the airport for a reason you can enjoy it for what it is. It has three nice pools, good restaurants, a beautiful view of the harbor, a nice walkway between the two towers, clean and comfortable rooms, plenty of outdoor seating, good service and it's close to downtown. What's not to like?

<Title>“Avoid this inhospitable hotel at all costs”
<Content>Worst hotel experience ever. A security guard came to our room for a noise complaint. So, we closed the balcony door which had been open to allow fresh air to come in. Next thing you know, no less than FOUR Harbor police cars are dispatched to the hotel. Apparently our next door neighbor complained that we were shuffling cards too loud. We were not loud at all. We are not partiers! The lobby has music blasting at all hours of the night and due to the location of the hotel, airplanes flying nearby from not only the San Diego International Airport but also North Island Naval Station in Coronado across the bay, and a friendy game of cards gets us kicked out of this hotel! We were in the west tower (you have no choice when checking in which tower you get) and the guest rooms in this particular building must have paper thin walls (which is a shame because the hotel itself is pretty nice). To add insut to injury, the front desk refused to move us to a different room or refund our money and we couldn't even check out properly because their "system was down". Fianlly, I contacted the Guest Experience Supervisor and while he was courteous, he said there was nothing he could do for us.

<Title>“Pretty Good!”
<Content>My partner and I stayed at the Sheraton during the middle of the week while a major conference was going on at the hotel. Our room was on the tenth floor of the East Wing looking over the Marina towards downtown. Pluses: 1) Spectacular view of the San Diego skyline and wonderful location along the marina! 2) Very comfortable beds. 3) The lobby is very nicely designed with a feature called Yahoo Link. PC workstations are clustered in groups around comfortable chairs and tables. High speed broadband service is free along with wireless access if you bring your laptop. Yahoo Link adjoins the Aroma Cafe where snacks and beverages are available. The idea is to create a place to "meet and greet" and hangout. 4) The fitness center is equipped with all new Lifecycle treadmills, bicycles, etc. The facility is spotless and well air conditioned. 5) The lagoon style meandering pool is very nice and in certain places very compatible with lap swimming. Minuses: 1) Room decor in the East Wing needs to be updated. Furniture isn't bad, but the table and floor lamps look like something out of the Victorian past. Previous reviews refer to a nautical theme in the West Wing--hardly the case here. 2) High speed access is $11.95 in the guest rooms--it's still a mystery why upper scale hotels charge for internet access and value hotels don't. 3) Parking is expensive everywhere and no less so at the Sheraton. Overall, I would definitely stay again!

<Title>“The beds were comfortable... and the view was nice”
<Content>Well the subject about sums up the good points of staying at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. First for people who have never stayed there, the hotel is broken up into 2 buildings an East and West side located about 200 yards apart from one another. If you're staying in the west wing, most of the hotel amenities are located in the east wing. If you're staying in the east wing, well there is more airport noise to deal with. But either way they absolutely nickle and dime you for everything. You're afraid to even get comfortable in your room due to over inflated hidden charges. And I'm not sure if anyone else experienced this but every 5 minutes our TV would switch back to the premium channel guide to purchase pay per view movies. The water in the room was $4.00 per bottle (if you drank it) $2.00 sodas, 19% add on plus $3.00 for every room service call, internet $13 dollars a day, parking (self parking) $16.00 a day and the onsite "Bistro" was ridiculously way over priced. The staff was cold, corporate and unhelpful (except for the bell boys... they were pleasant). We'll never come back to Sheraton/Starwood brand hotel again after this experience. We paid way to much money for this room to realize once we're checked in that there is a surcharge on breathing their air. Not really, but why not... they may as well charge for that too.

<Title>“Not worth the money, even if you get a bargain”
<Content>We got a great deal on the hotel for labor day weekend and the best part about the experience was the view. We got an awesome view of the marina and the lanai pool. However, only 1 elevator out of 2 was working the whole weekend and we either had to take the service elevator or walk all the way down the hall if we wanted to go up to the 5th floor. Otherwise, the wait was like 10 mins. Totally ridiculous. The internet is NOT part of your stay which is so cheesy because the Days In gives it to you for free. We argued with them because when you log in it appears you don't have to pay by entering your hotel room number but we got billed $12 a day for the internet and we only logged in for total of 3 hours over 3 days. Finally, the valet guys were all really nice but the parking was sooooo expensive. $16 a day and we did self parking and husband would drop off/pick up in front of the hotel and the valet guys were really nice about it. We didn't know there was a fee for parking and you are not close enough to park anywhere else so totally not worth staying at this hotel. You can do so much better for the price. The bedding was comfortable and they have nice goose down pillows and comforters but that was it. Shop around..don't come here if you don't have to.

<Title>“Not bad for a Priceline find”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the West Tower from 8/24-8/28. The hotel had a large, recently renovated room with a nautical theme. Overall, the room was comfortable (esp. the bed)..however the bathroom could have been cleaner...the floor of the tub looked dirty. The other thing was there was no safe in the room...which I found to be odd. I normally like to place my valuables in the safe while I am visiting a city...it just makes easier for me. The room was facing the bay and it was definitely a beautiful view. We did not get to try any of the restaurants while staying here. The parking charge was ridiculous...$16 for self park and about $22 for valet..The one night they had a sweet sixteen and a weddding...therefore the self parking was full to capacity and the valet parking had a really looong wait. As for the airport noise, I did not hear even one while at the West Tower. However, the one afternoon we went to the East Tower and I noticed the airplane noise there. The front desk was helpful and friendly...but there was always a wait...I think they need to hire more people. It seemed as though the front desk was dealing with quite a few unhappy guests (one customer was being overcharged and another was a bride and groom who had made a reservation for five rooms and they messed up their reservations.) On our second night there, we had a problem with the bathtub...after showering, the water was not going down. We called the front desk and they sent someone up. After a half hour of using a wet vac to un-clog the tub (which caused the room to smell like a sewer from some reason), the man said it was fixed and that he would send someone up to clean the mess made in the bathroom from the wet-vac. My husband and I waited a half hour and then needed to call the front desk to find out where the cleaning service was (he still needed to shower as we were trying to make our dinner reservations), they assured us someone would be right up. We then waited another fifteen minutes...but there was still no cleaning service. Once again we called the front desk and they assured us someone was on there way...a few minutes later someone arrived to clean the bathroom. However, after my husband showered, the tub was clogged again. Since we did not want to go through what happened again, we asked for a new room for the next day. The front desk was more than happy to move us to another room. However, in this room the main light wasn't working..but it was not a big deal...the bahttub still looked a bit dirty. Overall, the hotel experience was okay for the price we paid on Priceline....if I had paid full price for this hotel, I would have been furious.

<Title>“Enjoyed my stay”
<Content>We just came back from our 4day trip to S.D. Our stay at the Sheraton was good. I checked in early to get a good view, but since we requested two adjoining rooms they could'nt accomodate us with a better view unless we separated (understandable). We stayed at the east tower. All the restaurants and the main pool are at the east tower, just nice. The pool side food is typical of hotel food pricey and not that great. The hotel has updated its look in some areas and some are desperatly asking for help like the arcade. My sister stayed in the west tower. Rooms are renovated and seem larger. If your not traveling with family, stay there its more quiet. Overall we enjoyed our stay, Im not a big winer.

We were awoken every morning at 6 am by the airplanes taking off. The hotel itself is lovely and comfortable, but Location, Location, Location. We ended up leaving early because we couldn't take the disruption anymore.

<Title>“Nicer than expected”
<Content>My partner, son and I recently stayed at this Sheraton. As I fly often out of San Diego Airport, I often had seen this hotel which is located just across the street from the airport. From that distance, to be honest, it looks like a big 1960-ish (not too attractive) building. So, I must say that I had low expectations of the hotel when I decided to stay there. I thought it would just be a cold airport hotel where people would stay only for the convenience of the airport - not as a destination hotel. I am happy to write, however, that the hotel is much, much nicer when you are in it than how it had seemed from a distance! The service was very good (the valet parkers, the registration, bell-hops) and the views from the windows on the seventh floor were really beautiful. From one side you see the skyline of San Diego and from the other side you see the boats in the harbor/marina. The food there was also very good. My only complaint was that the overnight parking fee is quite high. We didn't hear any airplane noise, even though we were just minutes away from the airport. We just had the basic room, so that's what we got. It seemed like it had recently been renovated and was very clean and nice. The square footage seemed a little sparse (the room was kind of narrow shaped). Had a nice little balcony from which we could see the boats too! All in all, a fine place for a night or two.

<Title>“pleasant stay”
<Content>My wife and I stayed with our one year old daughter for five nights August 2006. We booked through priceline and were very pleased with the hotel. We were placed in the west tower in a second floor room overlooking the swimming pool. The room was clean and a good size, with a small balcony. The hotel is very close to the airport and anybody wanting an early night or a long lie in might be disturbed by airplane noise or the noise from the swimming pool-which was quiet after 10.30pm. The hotel is on Harbor island - it's easy to go for a stroll from the hotel along San Diego Bay with lovely views of downtown. It's too far to walk downtown, but it's only a five minute drive away. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant one morning- it's a fairly standard breakfast buffet and relatively expensive at $19 but was done well. Car parking is $14 a day. I called the hotel to request a crib the night before we arrived and was told that availability could not be guaranteed. However, on arrival a crib was available and there was no charge for this. In summary the hotel is a good choice for a family vacation in a good location as long as you are not upset by a small amount of noise from about 7am until 11pm

<Title>“Had a great time at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina”
<Content>My family and I just returned from our San Diego vacation where we stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. After reading some of the previous reviews, I had mixed feelings going into this trip. However, once I arrived at the hotel, all my concerns quickly disappeared and our stay was completely enjoyable. We stayed in the West Tower and even with 2 children (we had a king room with a rollaway and a crib) were were comfortable and had ample room. Our room faced the bay which was the best free entertainment. My 2 year old had a blast letting us know anytime a helicopter or airplane took off from North Island or a large ship was passing by. We could also see the Coronado Bridge, downtown San Diego and Point Loma from our balcony. We were also treated to fireworks being setoff near the bridge a couple of nights. The hotel has 3 lovely pools, a small one at the West Tower (with bar/food service), the larger "main" pool and another small pool at the East Tower. The "main" pool has poolside dining with waitstaff service. The food was good although typicaly priced for hotel food. It arrived quick, hot and with a smile from the server who checked on us frequently to make sure things were good. They also accomodated substitutions for the ingredients (ie: chicken for shrimp on the salad). They also allow (and sell) pool toys which was great for my kids. The walk from the West Tower to the East Tower was pleasant, with beautiful views of the harbor. There's a great little deli (Papanani's) along the way which was open for breakfast, lunch and dinner until 8pm. They serve the best tasting ice cream! Also, another poster stated there wasn't a game room/arcade as advertised but there is one, tucked away off the "main" pool, near the spa entrance. The one downfall I found at this property was the $16 to self-park your car (you really need one, the hotel's not downtown or walking distance to public transportation) in the parking lot directly in front of the hotel. But. there are no other parking options available so as a hotel guest, you are stuck with the fee. Overall, this hotel was comfortable, roomy and very accomodating to my family and we would definitely stay here in the future.

<Content>We recently decided to splurge on a nice hotel in San Diego to celebrate our 25 anniversary. We were very pleased with the "Stay 5 nights, get a night free" with a guaranteed view room at the San Diego Sheraton's West Tower. We stayed in a beautifully refurbished room overlooking the San Diego harbor and skyline. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. It was pricey, but worth it!

<Title>“The WORST for the money!”
<Content>Our experience at the Sheraton was terrible. We had upgraded to a "deluxe" room when we made our reservations. Our family of four was put into a cracker box size room ( told "all rooms are the same size") with a Motel 6 bathroom, no, sorry Motel 6.... worse.. ( cracked toilet, mold in the grout line of the bathtub and not just a little! A sink that when you turned it on the faucet would break off and again, small, small) The AC was not working, the fan made a terrible noise. They nickle and dime for EVERYTHING...local calls $2.00 a minute, internet usage fees, parking $16.00. They even wanted to charge $25.00 to put a frig in our room) At $200 a night...are they serious? What made it all worse was the insincere smiles from the maniquins at the front desk who could have cared LESS about our experience. Needless to say after one night ( booked for four) we checked out. Found a LOVELY Best Western. The Island Palms and for the same rate checked into a beautiful marina side queen suite, full kitchen, huge bathroom, seperate bedroom. No fees for parking, free wireless, beautiful grounds and pool. AHHHHH now we could enjoy our vacation and we did. Sheraton? Just say NO!

<Title>“Very nice”
<Content>We stayed here for three nights at the end of June 2006. Overall the experience was very nice. The best was our view from our balcony over the boats in the marina. It is very close to the airport, but the airplane noise did not bother us. The pool was clean and not too crowded. The beds were very comfortable, bathroom was clean. Location was perfect for us seeing the sights of San Diego. If I had negative comments, it would be that the carpet seemed old and daily parking was expensive ($16/day, just add it to the rate of your room to make yourself feel better). We did not eat at the restaurants, due to the fact we were looking for cheap eats. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>We stayed here July 1 and 2, 2006 and had a great stay. We spoke to quite a few employees asking questions about renting bikes, restaurants, etc and everyone was very friendly and helpful. We even got lost downtown looking for a restaurant and I called the hotel for help ... the girl gave me directions and was really friendly. We stayed in the West Tower, and I guess the rooms have been recently renovated (see pix). I thought the rooms were really large and you can see the ocean from bed (we had a bay view). The bathroom needed a bit of updating but the room itself was quite nice. We ate at the Harbor's Edge which is in the East Tower and had a lovely lunch - service and food were good. The calamari was so yummy and tender! We spent our pool time at the West Tower pool though ... the East Tower pool was too crowded with too many kids for my taste. The West pool is more low-key although it also has a bar/food service counter. We would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Nice place...worth the money”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton during the 4th of July weekend. The rooms were nice, can't beat the view for the fireworks. Food was a little pricey but so is everything else in the area. Only do side if your not going to the harbor, you have to drive. Staff was very helpful. I would stay there again.

<Title>“Harbor is beautiful”
<Content>I will simply list the pros and cons i observed from my stay at this property. overall it was very nice and my kids and i enjoyed our stay. i stayed in the west tower that has been recently renovated. pros: beautiful harbor-try to get a room with a view nice lobby free wireless internet in the lobby nice spacious rooms with upgraded new linens higher end toiletries(shampoo/conditioner) nice balcony in every room good central air conditioning with modern and effective temperature control adequate gift shop in west tower, good for forgotten items in room coffee with liquid creamer not powder (yes its the little things) modest pool that is pretty private (most ppl go to the nicer pool at the east tower) and overlooks the harbor nice poolside bar at the east tower parking is very close to the hotel at the west tower close to downtown cons: front desk check in staff was cold and snippy about what room i could get. i asked for the east tower. i was told in no uncertain terms that i would get what i got. well not that bad, but close. otherwise, the staff was very nice PARKING is too expensive! 16/day for self parking. ridiculous airport noise was very distracting the first day and morning. you get a prompt wake up at 6:30 am. you are literally next door to the airport. we got used to it eventually. room service and dining there is extremely expensive-the food was pretty good though most ammenities are in the east tower, so you have to walk over there..about 1/4 mi if you want to enjoy them. there is no game room/arcade as advertised (disappointed teenager)

<Title>“WATCH THOSE "LITTLE EXTRAS!"”
<Content>Our family stayed at the Sheraton because my husband was a speaker at a conference there. We got a reduced (conference) rate and I have to say it was a fair price for the value. Their beds are terrific! Even the rollaway bed (an additional $20 per day) is terrific! It was very quiet, and I always appreciate that. The morning coffee and tea setup on each floor was nice. We were annoyed at the $16 per day parking fee. Seems like conference participants, in particular, should be able to park for free! We could not afford to eat in their restaurant, and the prices of bar drinks was out of sight in comparison to other area restaurants and bars. One morning we had no water at all, and one of the two elevators was out of order. Check-out took forever because of a $100 billing error. Management finally removed the five $20 "extra" fees because they could not provide proof of what the fee was for. We didn't appreciate them trying to get away with this. The location is splendid. Others on-line have complained about the airport noise--it did not bother us at all.

<Title>“West tower, like a boutique hotel.”
<Content>I stayed at the West tower for a business function and loved the intimacy. I did stroll over to the East tower and it was hopping! Beautiful lobby, bar, internet cafe, and restaurants. However, for me it was too busy. The airport is very close so be prepared for prompt 6:30am wake-up calls!

<Title>“Nice harbor views.”
<Content>We also booked our reservation through Priceline and felt it was a good deal. The East Tower has a lot of energy. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We could see part of the airport from our balcony but were not ever bothered by the noise, even with the patio door open. Excellent views of the harbor. No need to rent a car if you're comfortable with taxis - quick trip to the Gaslight Quarter. Nice pool.

<Title>“Not bad at all, but make sure you book through Priceline”
<Content>I don't know what the going rate per night is for this hotel, but I'd imagine it's close to $200/night. However, it can be had for approximately $90/night through Priceline. My wife and I got a room at that rate and just spent 5 nights at the Sheraton last week. Overall, I don't really have too much to complain about. The rooms were quite small, but definitely sufficient for 2 people on vacation. You are very very close to the airport and can hear planes taking off on a regular basis during the day, but you get used to it pretty quickly. Overall, the hotel is somewhat noisy. Our air condition made a racket at night and the walls are somewhat thin. Parking is a total rip off--$16/night for "self parking". But if you get a deal on the room it's easier to justify this. You really do need to rent a car as it doesn't seem like there are many public transit options in San Diego, so the parking can't be avoided (there's nowhere else nearby to park). The pool at the hotel is quite nice and very large, and the location of the hotel on the marina is nice as well, and you're just 5-10 minutes from downtown. Also, the lobby is impressive and they have computers set up where you can get online for 30 minutes if you are a guest. Concierge was very very very helpful and the staff are all quite nice. In my opinion, this hotel is a bargain at $90/night. At the full rate, not so much.

<Content>For the $90 priceline rate we got on this hotel, it worked for us. We got a great room with wonderful view of the bay, downtown skyline and Coronado Bridge. Concierge was great with directions and staff was very friendly. I would have been disappointed had we paid full price, but for what we paid, I was more than satisfied.

<Title>“Not a Vacation Hotel”
<Content>Stayed in the West Tower for four nights. The elevator and hallways STUNK. On two separate occasions, people in the elevator commented to us how bad it smelled in the hotel. The room was very small. The first night, my husband was convinced there were bed bugs as he was up most of the night after feeling like he'd been bit and finding small, black objects in the sheets. Had the sheets changed out the next day and did not have any further issues. Hotel is definitely convenient to the airport. It is acceptable for business travel of one night or maybe two, but don't stay here if you like spacious rooms or you're looking for a vacation experience.

<Title>“Not bad, if you get it at a discounted rate.”
<Content>The lobby was nice, when I first walked in. The registration desk people were very friendly at check-in. I ended up in the East Building in the North Wing. The room wasn't anything spectacular, just a regular room. The worst thing that I experienced there was that, despite the scalding hot bath water, when I changed it to shower it was adequately warm, although I had it all the way hot. Self-parking is $16/day and valet is $22/day. They figure they can get you there, since the hotel isn't really close to downtown. I thought that having free internet access, for hotel guests, in lobby was great. The buffet was pretty good at $18. Not like we had any choice because the average dish was $14 (for french toast, pancakes, omelettes, etc.) What would you choose, considering you could get all-you-can-eat for about $4 more? A no-brainer there.

<Title>“Great room & view at Sheraton Marina San Diego”
<Content>Stayed in the west tower of the Sheraton Marina San Diego pre-cruise. Very attractive room, super helpful front desk and the view of the sailboats racing was incredible! Be sure to book a bay, not marina, view in the west tower (the east tower has not been renovated to my knowledge). Nice complementary appetizers for happy hour in the lounge.

<Title>“Great stay”
<Content>Stayed here for 4 days for business during the first week of March. I stayed in the east tower and the room was clean, well-maintained, and recently remodeled. I did not experience any of the airport noise. The hotel staff was extremely polite and professional at all of our company functions. Room rate was $199 which is high - but not for this part of San Diego. It would have been nice if there was a beach, but this is a "marina" hotel.

<Title>“loved the location”
<Content>My daughter and I just returned from a six night stay at the Sheraton. The hotel has just finished a complete renovation and is immaculate. We are very fussy travelers, pride ourselves in staying at nice places and were very happy with the Sheraton. The rooms are done in a nautical theme, very clean and a great view of the harbor. We were on the sixth floor, away from the elevator but close to the ice machine which turned out to not be an issue. The people were quite pleasant, the food was great but quite expensive. Service was a bit slow. We stayed in the West Tower, much quieter than the East Tower. Only a 2 minute walk along the marina between hotels. We'd definately stay there again, the closeness to the airport we found to be a help.

<Content>Stayed in the West Building at $229 (convention rate) and found all new carpet, paint, paper, and furnishings. Small bathroom, but huge, comfortable hotel room. Surprised that bathroom light fixture is mounted so low that it's impossible to see mirror without ducking (I'm only 5'9"). Very pleasant, attentive desk, bell, and parking staff. Internet service overpriced - try to buy wireless service provided by the marina outdoors - it works from many hotel rooms.

<Content>We brought our entire company (28 people) to this hotel for a weekend stay. No one had any problems or complaints. Beautiful property, great location and excellent service. I would highly recommend this hotel for family travel as well. Anything you want to do in San Diego is just 5 minutes away and being next to the airport was not a problem. The view from either side is spectacular. The best hotel experience I have had in San Diego.

<Title>“Excellent! I loved it”
<Content>Stayed here for 3 nights for Christmas 2005. Pros: 1) Very quick check-in. Requested for a high floor, 2 double beds, and facing the marina, and got it! 2) Very plush, clean, comfortable beds with 4 pillows (on each double bed) 3) Great views from the balcony 4) 5 free internet access/computers in the lobby: very nice modern setup with flat screen Sony monitors, free printing; also a lounge area with flat screen TV. 5) Large swimming pool, usually almost empty each day we swam; nice adjacent hot tub. 6) Convenience store at the lobby was great and essential 7) Laundry facilities!! very nice surprise; washer and dryers definitely helped during the trip 8) Lobby was nicely decorated with grand christmas tree + aquarium 9) For a hotel located right next to the airport, we didn't hear any planes at all! (except for loud next door neighbors) 10) Never pay anything above $99 for this hotel. It is priced right at $99/night. Neutral: 1) Had the christmas buffet dinner, and it was definitely bland. Alcoholic drinks were weak. Should have gone to a restaurant in the Gaslamp District for much less than the $122 we were charged at the hotel. Cons: 1) Gym/health spa was closed & under renovation. Website was not updated until my day of arrival, so I could not fully complain. 2) Parking is a mess at times; no free spots, so you circle around and around and wait and wait 3) Thin walls- loud people in the rooms next door can bother you 4) Small bathrooms 5) No wireless internet; pay for ethernet access

<Title>“good view, but...”
<Content>Stayed in the west wing just before new years. A definite mixed bag. First, keep in mind that this property is really 2 different hotels about a quarter mile apart. The east wing is the larger hotel and the closest to the airport, and also the one with the most amenities. Very much a large convention property. The west wing (which the bellboy said used to be a Westin) is undergoing extensive renovation, or was when we were there. This was a problem for just about everybody -- guests, workers and hotel staff. At one point only one elevator was working, and much of the property was off-limits. To their credit, the hotel staff seemed to keep a positive and sympathetic attitude. Some guests seemed pretty put out. We actually didn't have a problem and since we were paying a discounted priceline rate, some of the irritants were easy to overlook. In fact, once the renovations are complete, this may be a better spot than the larger east wing. We loved our room with a great view of the bay and downtown San Diego. Cruise ships, yachts, fishing boats, kayakers...they all swept right by our balcony. Lots of joggers and walkers on the path by the bay too. The room was freshly remodeled... brand new, really...but not especially luxurious. Odd things were missing too -- like a lamp by the seating area (you couldn't read there at night) and the only mirror was in the bathroom. Pretty slim for a 4-star property. More like a 3-star. Anyway, the Sheraton west wing has a good location, and at this point that's about the best thing going for it. Get a room from a discounter and enjoy the view.

These i consider critical for a business hotel, and just what i would expect for this level of hotel. besides these issues an uneventful hotel eitherway. Also this hotel is within walking distance of the airport terminal,(no kidding).

<Title>“Better than expected!”
<Content>My wife, our 2 1/2 year old and myself stayed here back in late August for a late summer mini-vacation. Since we arrived on a Sunday night for a Mon-Tues stay, there were few 'tourists'. We basically shared the hotel with 850 members of a conference being held at the hotel while we were there. Based on reviews on 'Trip Advisor', we selected this hotel as part of our AAA packaged vacation (it included Sea World admission). We requested a East Tower (Main Tower) room with a view of the marina (see photos). Since we were there over a work week, we basically had the breakfast buffet to ourselves and all of the conference members had come and gone by the time we came downstairs. Close to Sea World, Zoo, Downtown and across the street from the airport. Location is great and sure beats the 'Hotel Circle' area (noisy freeway traffic at all hours). And a much better view! We were met by a nice, helpful staff and will enjoy a return visit to the hotel in the future. By the way, if you have kids, they'll love the huge fish tank in the lobby.

<Title>“Hotel Under Renovations”
<Content>I recently completed a stay at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel And Marina. This hotel is current undergoing extensive renovations. During our stay, there was loud pounding and jack hammering from 8:45 AM to 6 PM on a Friday and Saturday. The hallways also smelled like carpet glue and the elevators were used for construction. This construction is very disrupting to a guest expecting a relaxing weekend at a four star hotel. The hotel does not disclose the construction on their website and only informs guests about the renovations at check-in. I would not stay at this hotel again, while it is under construction.

<Content>I stayed her on business for 5 days. I was skeptical based on the reviews, but was pleasantly surprised after I checked in. I loved the room. I stayed in the tower side with a view of the city. Every room has a balcony, which you canâ€™t beat! The Room was spacious and the bedding was so comfortable. I enjoyed by post conference breaks on the terrace watching the people come and go. It was about a $13-15 cab ride to the gas lamp district. The bathroom was average, but I must mention the fabulous hair dryer! Top notch Con-air. The lobby was great and has free wireless internet. Very comfy couches and a great bar Quinns. It is a great place to do business. Being near the airport was not a problem. All and all a great trip and a better stay.

<Title>“Nice stay for $200 a night”
<Content>We made reservations for the club level which included parking and breakfast. My husband travels alot and is a gold almost platnuim starwood member. They were remolding the club floor so the upgraded us to a two room suite with two full baths and three tvs. They gave us breakfast buffet at the resteraunt which was excelent with waffles and omlets made to order. That alone would be $30 a person plus $ 14 for parking. Almost everywhere in San Diego you pay to park. I was suprised we did not have internet service which is usually on club floors. After speeking with the manager they let us use the business center for free. I would recomend booking a club room cheeper then all the extras all acart. We stayed 5 nights with close acess to zoo, sea world, downtown events. We did not have any problem with plane noise, my son 8 liked to see the big ships comming and going everyday and the pool was fine to relax after outings.

<Title>“Pleasantly Surprised â€“ Awesome Stay!!”
<Content>After reading all the reviews we were very hesitant about staying at this hotel. We had tried Priceline for the first time ever and for $111 we got this room. We usually stay at Loweâ€™s Coronado retreat, but now that we have a baby, we are trying to save some money. We loved our stay here. The room was super clean and had an awesome view of the harbor. We slept with the balcony door open. Our room was on the seventh floor of the West Tower. It was a nice room (bathroom a little small- but who cares with the view we were given- we didnâ€™t come to bath). The West Tower we are told is not as nice as the East Tower, but we had a great time. We had dinner at the East Tower. Our son was hypnotized by the huge beautiful fish tank in the lobby of the East Tower. The staff was super friendly and helpful. We found the bellman to be the most informative. We just found the whole experience to be a surprise, we expected bad and we got great. We never heard planes, we didnâ€™t have a bad room, we just had a great experience!

<Title>“Great view and it stops there”
<Content>I attended a conference and just got back yesterday. The location is great from a view perspective, right on the marina. Oh but wait, are you afraid of airplanes. If you are do not stay here. You can watch planes take off every 90 seconds; that's the statistics they quote. Oh they are wonderful pilots since there is only one run way. If you like being situated at an airport this is the place for you. I generally stay at a Marriott so I was disappointed in this older hotel. The room was so so. The service was friendly and generally accommodating but I called to get a wake up call twice and neither one of them were received. This could be a real problem if I didn't wake up on my own. The pool was small compared to the Marriotts I stayed at and there were maybe two umbrellas at the entire pool. Major problem if you burn easy as I do, so I couldn't stay near the pool. $22 for hotel valet parking -that's a day. $16 if you park it yourself. Oh did I mention the $20 a day to connect to the internet, I think it should be included on a business convention trip. Its that petty overpricing that bothers me. The room rate was reasonable, they get you on the extras. The bed was okay but I found the rooms really hot and very very noisy. I could hear the toilets in the next room flush. I have a coworker who had a leak in her room which wasn't fixed all week. Her carpet was wet. Stay someplace else unless you really want a great marina view.

<Title>“Better than we expected”
<Content>After reading the reviews for this hotel in the weeks leading up to our vacation in late August, I was terrified about what we would encounter. However, since my expectations were so low, due to the other reviews, we were pleasantly surprised. Our check in was very easy with an attentive valet and pleasant front desk staff and the Bellman, Andy was very friendly and quick! (our bags were in our room within minutes of our check-in and even then he was apologetic about the "delay") Self-parking fees are steep, but we never had any trouble finding a space close to our room and our Key Card actually worked, for the whole six days. We were given a room in the East Tower, right over the pool, which could be noisy if the window was open, but it was great for our daughter to be so close to the pool. We only ate in the bar, for dinner, which wasn't any more expensive than any other hotel food. Our room was clean and we had no complaints about the service or our stay. As we had booked our trip through Expedia, we had a nice stay for the price we paid for high season in San Diego. The only complaint we had was that there were very few restaurants close by. It would be tough if you were staying for a conference and didn't have a car. All in all, it was a nice stay at a nice property.

I and felt like I was just part of their massive operation there.. and as soon as I got there I had to deal with extras that I was not interested.. like the automatic registration for this and that... The first morning I got 3 wake-up calls at 5:30am which I did not request... they even thought it was funny. Its a pity because the area and sorrounding environment is really nice!

<Title>“Hey - It's a Sheraton! By the Airport! It's Nice!”
<Content>Stayed at the Sheraton Towers Marina for two nights - August 19 and 20. Make no mistake, this can be a very busy place. Especially in August as folks make one last getaway before the start of school, etc. We reserved a nice "cozy" room on the Club Level that had a fantastic view of the harbor and downtown from the 11th floor. Staying on this level also gave you free self parking and a very nice continental breakfast each morning. Worth considering if you compare to their other room rates where these two items could run you an extra $30 to $40 per day. Rooms were very quiet considering you are less than a half mile from the airport. The location is great - you are really only a 10 minute drive from Old Town, Downtown, Sea World, Balboa Park, and other locations. Two lowlights - check-in on a Friday evening (about 6pm) with only one clerk at the desk. It took forever - what were they thinking about staffing on one of their busiest nights of the summer! The other issue was the A/C in the room - it only runs on AUTO mode, so it can be a real sleep stealer if you are a light sleeper. The staff was all very nice and the grounds are certainly pretty. We enjoyed our stay.

<Title>“Met expectations”
<Content>Stayed here over an August weekend and I would confirm most of what has been said in previous reviews. Booked room through discount website for $105/night, which is very cheap for a San Diego weekend stay in the busy season. Assigned a large room facing marina in West tower on lower level. I would recommend this hotel assuming you are not paying rack rate ($229/night), because there are much nicer truly 4* hotels available downtown at that price. Pros: -View of marina -Clean room, no service problems or complaints -Close drive to downtown, beaches, Coronado, zoo, etc. Cons: -If you don't have a car the hotel is not within walking distance of downtown, beaches, or anything else. -Definitely not a 4*--furnishings and hallways are a little worn and dated, especially in west Tower. -Lanai rooms looked dark and motel-like.

<Title>“We Loved It!”
<Content>I was very impressed with the hotel. We were there on our honeymoon Aug 15th-20th and had a great stay. Maybe this is because I asked for a nice room at check in? We were in Lania room 5320 of the east tower with a lovely view of the pool and harbor. The spa staff is rude so I didn't book with them, but there is a spa on every corner in San Diego. I recommend Elaine at the Meridian for hair and make-up. I would give the hotel 3-3 1/2 stars. We wanted a clean and safe place to stay and this fit the bill. The key card readers on the self parking gates do not work. This is not a big deal as all you have to do is take a ticket and tell the gaurd your room number when you leave. We had an excellent time with parking. We got a spot directly in front of the elevator to our room the entire stay. The hotel also has a fabulous location. Request the east tower with a pool view and you'll be happy here. :) I only wish my camera had picked up the view in the background.

<Title>“Could have been worse, but definitely could have been better...”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton in July. Pros: -The hotel itself is attractive. -The bed was very comfortable. -Our room was clean. (This was the only reason we didn't attempt to find another hotel.) -The pool and hot tub were large and nice. -We had fun playing pool at the sports bar, which is even family friendly. -We had a beautiful view. Cons: -The rooms are worn and outdated. (We changed rooms twice to compare both towers.) -The bathroom was small and unappealing. -The hotel is not far from downtown, but it's still distanced from everything. -The valet was the worse! No one opened my car door for me, or even assisted us with our luggage. Maybe they were busy, but this was not a good impression. Maybe we are just to picky, but there are so many beautiful hotels in San Diego and this was not one of them. For us the actual room we stay in is most important, and this Sheraton offered nothing special in their guest rooms.

<Title>“Bad Hotel”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel over the 4th of July as was moderately satisfied until about 3am on the first night when I was overwhelmed by a strong methane smell, the hotel said it looked into the problem but the smell got progressivly worse as our stay went on. The hotel expressed concern but did little, if anything, to fix the problem. There are many nice hotels in San Diego and I would strongly recomend avoiding this one.

<Title>“This is a convention hotel”
<Content>I recently stayed @ this hotel for a business meeting, August 1-4. I would not recomned this hotel to anyone on vacation. There were at least 2 other conventions going on while I was there. The line to get on the elevators @ 5 PM was insane. Most people opted for the stairs. Since I was there for business I did not get to use the pool, gym, or any of the restaurants. **People who need "white noise" to sleep take my advice! Bring your own sound maker or something. I so regretted not brining something since I had read on here that the AC in the rooms will NOT stay on- even in the "fan" mode. I was constantly waking up when the LOUD AC came on and off. Pros for this hotel: 1. Great view of the marina & boats 2. VERY close to the AP (w/ minimal noise) 3. Rooms appear to be updated although not extremely clean 4. Nice bed 5. 10 minute/$10 cab ride to down town Cons: 1. This is a convention hotel so there are swarms of people everywhere 2. There are 2 "towers." You may find yourself walking back and forth a lot 3. Not sure what other San Diego attractions are that close? I hope this review was helpful.

<Title>“Sheraton not a 4 star hotel”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and marins in San Diego. I paid for the club level rooms which included free breakfast in the executive room and free parking. The room faced the marina and bay. Room is small and lacked finer comforts. A basic room, not worthy of a 4 star rating. Small closet and one dresser. Below the room are the loading dock for hotel and parking lot. I was on the 11th floor and every morning, we heard trucks loading and unloading supplies. They were errecting a tent and we heard every hammer and truck. Airport noise is almost non-existent but truck and motorcycle noise was constant. If you are seeking a view in this hotel, ask for side side facing downtown. More scenic and quiet. Parking is a nightmare. Key cards did not work for self parking. I attempted to enter lot late at night and key card did not open the gate. Several cars behind me caused a mini traffic jam while I had to reverse. Found a attendent to assist me. The lot is huge and very dark. Not safe for a woman alone to park a car alone. Paths to the hotel are not marked and we stumbled through bushes and a unexpected 5 foot drop trying to find a side walk. Valet parking, a $8.00 additional charge is almost a necessity. WE complained about parking at desk but clerk did not seemed concerned. No method to test key card until you try to park. To late! Internet is available for $13.25 per 24 hours. Wireless service not available. Outside eating opportunities are very limited. The pool in east tower is very nice and quiet. Overall, service is very good and employees will assist patrons. This is a convention hotel, not designed for families and tourists. The west tower would offer a better view of the bay. Not a four star hotel. Club level rooms not worth the extra money.

<Title>“Beautiful scenery”
<Content>We spent 3 nights at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. We stayed in the East Tower (the West tower looked nice, also). The hotel is situated on Harbor Island, where there is a marina with yachts, boats, and sailboats. We had two rooms, both were very clean and well-stocked with towels, soaps, shampoo, conditioner, coffee & creamer. It also had a hair dryer and an ironing board with iron. The beds were very comfortable. We had trouble figuring out how to set the alarm clocks, so we just dialed the automated "wake-up" call, which only took a few seconds. We also could not find any pens in the room to write postcards, but did find some next the the pay phones near the lobby. We also had some trouble with the air conditioning controls. The thermostat had a setting to run the fan low, medium, and high. We turned it on high, as we like the humming sound when we sleep. However, it would turn on for about 10 seconds, then shut back off. The room temperature was comfortable, but we couldn't get the fan to stay on. The hotel restaurants were somewhat pricey for us, considering we had children. They offered a breakfast buffet for $18.99 per person. Our children are too old to be offered the children's prices, but also not big enough to eat $18.99 worth of breakfast. Instead, we bought pastries and bagels from the cafe, and that ran about $20.00 total. There were only a few restaurants on Harbor Island, so bring a car or your walking shoes, because you may have to walk about 1 - 2 miles. Even though this hotel is very close to the airport, we didn't notice a lot of noise. Occassionally we would hear a plane flying by, but it wasn't very loud. It was actually a bonus, as we ate at a restaurant down the street late on evening, and the view of the planes flying over the bay was beautiful. The service we received at the check-in counter was average. We paid for our 2 rooms weeks before our trip (via check). However, their records didn't show our room as being prepaid, so they asked for our credit card. I was very concerned that they didn't show us paying $1400 and told them we had a cancelled check, but they didn't seem concerned or even try to help. They just wanted our credit card so they could check us in. After more discussions, I finally got the name and extension of a person in accounting to talk to. However, I could not get ahold of this person and left voice mail. The next day, I still had not heard anything, so I went to the check-in desk and found out it was taken care of. I think they could have at least called us and told us they fixed the accounting error, or apologized. But at that point I was happy that they agreed that we did indeed pay for our rooms already. The concierge was extremely helpful in helping us plan a sightseeing tour. She had very much information and was very knowledgeable. Since there is no beach on Harbor Island, we went swimming the the hotel's pool. However, the evenings were cool, and we didn't realize until the last night of our stay that there is a whirlpool just a little ways down from the outdoor pool. Once we found that, we spent the evening in there. The hotel also says they have a game room. However, all we saw was a couple ping-pong tables, and couldn't find the paddles or balls. We would stay at this hotel again, mostly for the beauty and the comfort. All the other things didn't really matter, because we were there to sight-see, not to spend the day at our hotel.

<Title>“Very Poor Value. Definitely not a repeat.”
<Content>Unfortunately we booked through Expedia and was originally booked at the Hampton Inn. Somehow we got bumped(!) from the Hampton and moved to the Sheraton. Actually we were happy about it because we thought it was a four star hotel and that we had been upgraded. Ha! For the money this was the worst place we have ever stayed. Room was average size with a very small bathroom (I think they reserve these rooms for Expedia, etc., it was very worn with stains eveywhere including the hallway. First floor with no view at all. $4.00 bottled water, and no refigerator. The breakfast buffet was $20.00 and parking $16.00 a day. We parked in the handicapped parking where there is no charge but the staff charged us anyway assuming that we parked in regular parking though it never registered through our card which you use to access the regular parking lot. By the way, a cheeseburger costs $13.00! We highly recommend travelers to San Diego (a beautiful city with tons to do) choose another facility. I checked with Consumer's Report when we got back to Dallas and sure enough all Sheretons are rated very low as far as value goes and the number of problems encountered.

<Title>“Beware the Lanai Rooms!”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton from July 2nd to July 8th. And understanding that it was a vacation week, expected to have a lot of folks there. We had requested bayside rooms (2 couples) for the fireworks and view. We were told that since we had requested king rooms, we could not have adjoining rooms, but we would be next to each other....good thing, since we're in the same rental car. When we arrived, we were put into the "Lanai Rooms" which seem to be from a much older hotel. The floors and, of course, ceilings are concrete and reflect every step taken on them. We were on the second floor and heard every step that anyone made above us. And the third floor was rented out to stompers. There were small children running rampant through out the hallways.....one ran into me and his parent acted like I was the one at fault. I guess the comment from an adult male, "small child at large" should have been a warning when the child was 30 feet behind and around a corner? The staff at the desk was rude. When we asked about the request for bayside rooms, we were told, "Well, you did book through expedia?" We will not stay at this hotel ever again.

<Content>I stayed at this hotel for a conference in July, 2005. What a wonderful location and view of the beauty of San Diego! The staff was welcoming and very accomodating. The morning breakfast buffet was excellent. Be sure to stay in the East tower and if you can, room 1024...what a relaxing place. I didn't even hear the neighboring airport sounds and truly enjoyed my stay. I would return in a minute!

<Title>“Watch out for the "Lanai" Rooms”
<Content>We stayed for 2 nights during a recent visit to San Diego. Given the price we paid, I was disapointed to be given a room in the "Lanai" section of the hotel which appears to be an old, converted motor lodge. The rooms were old, musty and overlooked the airport runway (constant noise from 6:00AM - midnight). Overall the lobby, tower rooms, and pool area were nice, but I would recommend avoiding the Lanai section.

<Title>“Enjoyed this hotel”
<Content>I just returned from a stay at this hotel and we enjoyed our time there. We were in the East Tower on the 10th Floor with a city view. We have stayed at this hotel before and always try to request a city view room and view of the airport. This may sound strange to some people, but we actually consider it a plus that the hotel is right across the street from the airport, as we enjoy watching the planes land and take off and noise does not bother us. The lobby is nice, with a nautical motif and large fish tank. The one thing I found "funny" is that our room decor did not seem to complement the nautical theme of the lobby. I almost felt like I was in two different hotels going from the lobby to the guest floors. The room was what I would call fairly generous in size (at least compared to some other cities). Since the hotel was nowhere near capacity during our stay (in fact is was empty the first 2-3 nights), the casual cafe/coffee shop was not open for breakfast. Only the main dining room was open. When a conference group came in during our 4th day there, they opened all the restaurants. We really did not utilize the dining options. For the first 3-4 nights we were there, the main pool was closed for repairs, but the smaller pool was open until 10pm. The healthclub also closes at 9pm. The hotel offers both valet and self parking. I would definitely plan to stay at this hotel again.

<Title>“Excellent service; beautiful view.”
<Content>The moment we entered the West Tower lobby, we were greeted by a staff who seemed genuinely interested in making our stay a pleasant one. My brother's family had booked a separate reservation. To accomodate my request that we have rooms on the same floor, his room was upgraded so that he could have a room across the hall. Throughout our stay, the desk staff was helpful in giving directions. My room was facing the harbor; the view from the balcony was especially beautiful at night. The room was spacious and very clean. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept on. Though the bathroom was a little small, it was adequate, and the water pressure in the shower was very good. On the down side, there were fees for self parking ($16/day) and use of the fitness center ($10). There was no refrigerator or minibar in the room, but I think we could have obtained one for a fee.

<Title>“Good View and Location”
<Content>We were here for a conference Jan 30 - Feb 1 , 2005. We stayed in the West tower (the smaller one) which had less amenities (smaller pool, less restaurants) but seemed less busy (reception less chaotic) and I prefered it to the East tower because of this. The pool at the West tower is fantastic looking though. Our room faced the harbour which was a lovely view and quieter than facing the marina. Marina facing rooms also face the airport and a busy road. The harbour facing rooms don't hear any airport or traffic noise. All rooms have nice balconies. The room was standard corporate design and needed redecorating to modernise the curtains and wallpaper. The beds and bedding were really nice and comfy. The room/plumbing were quiet. The location is great. Easy to find your way back to as you follow airport signs! Close to the highway and central to many attractions. The self parking is easy (charge). There's a nice walk along the harbour, and along the marina between the 2 towers. I probably wouldn't stay here if I was paying for it myself, unless there was a good deal on. After the 2 nights here we moved to the Empress Hotel in La Jolla, a smaller hotel.

<Title>“It's good to be G.O.D.”
<Content>We spent two nights here during the week between Christmas and New Year and at checkin found that I was G.O.D.: The Guest Of the Day. The staff greets you by name, you get to park right out front, we were upgraded to a small suite and breakfast was thrown in. Not bad on a $129 rate with a $25 credit to be applied to services (which, perhaps because of my heavenly status, was unused and thus deducted from the bill) for a nice hotel. We were there during the start of the horrendous rainy spell they've been having in Southern California and one day was a bit of a washout, so we shopped. The other was bright and sunny and although we didn't swim, the pool area looked clean and pleasant. We had no airplane noise from the airport: our room - on a Preferred Guest floor - faced the sea, not the airport. The room itself was fine - the balcony large enough to sit outside (on the good day) and the location of the hotel - near the airport but in the harbor - makes access to San Diego and the surrounding areas easy. My interactions with the staff were all friendly and helpful and the hotel is maintained in spotless condition. The lobby and other public areas are - as mentioned elsewhere in these reviews - spectacular. The only fault I found was the hotel's Club Lounge - it was overrun with guests, mainly families with children; seemingly unmonitored by anyone other than the beleaugered waitstaff and the breakfast offerings were minimal. I would urge anyone to consider this hotel if they want to be downtown (or close to the airport) without being downtown. I am a Starwood Platinum Guest and have stayed at perhaps one-third of Starwoods worldwide properties. The San Diego Sheraton is one of the better SW hotels in this category.

<Title>“had a merry Christmas”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton Christmas Eve and Christmas before heading on a cruise. Everyone was friendly, helpful and courteous. Upon arrival we upgraded for $20 since I had read the tip at Trip Advisor. We had gotten an excellent holiday discount on the net from the Sheraton, so we paid very little for such a nice room on the 10th floor. The Christmas decorations and music were lovely. The redecorated restaurant had a special Christmas menu. Someone who has a lot of money might expect a much fancier place. The hotel was perfect for two teachers, a teenager and a retired couple. We felt pampered.

The hotel was clean and grounds and pool area were beautiful. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Location was close to a lot of San Diego attractions. The only downside was the airport noise...normally we didn't hear the planes during the night but a couple of times planes took off early morning.

<Title>“Just another airport hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at this hotel Oct. 4-8. We booked through Hotwire and were given a complimentary upgrade upon check-in - we ended up on the 5th floor of the west tower with a view of the marina. The pros: friendly staff, comfy beds. The cons: a boring and nondescript property - if you just need a bed near the airport - this would be a fine choice. We did not have a car - my husband taxied back and forth to the convention center ($11-$13 each way) and I took the complimentary hotel shuttle back to the airport (a 3 minute ride) to catch the city bus ($2.25 fare) to downtown. Harbor Island is not a place you will find much to do - if you were to walk to the downtown area, it would be about 3 miles. Airplane noise was constant, but only heard by us when we had the balcony door open. The west tower was a short walk to the east tower - which is where the main lobby and restaurants were located (west tower had one expensive Italian restaurant). Overall, the west tower seemed to be the neglected step sister - the pool and grounds were nothing more than plain. If you do end up staying at this property, an independant deli exists between the towers, and you can pick up sandwiches, wine, pastry, coffee, etc.. for a fraction of the cost the hotel will charge you. Simply put, there was nothing special about this place, but nothing to complain about either, considering we payed $100 a night.

<Title>“Good memories from San Diego vacation”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton Harbor Island the last week of September 2004, in the East Tower. We booked through Expedia and upgraded our room when we arrived for 20 dollars per night (we expected to upgrade from the most basic room that a travel package would give you). We had a 10th floor room overlooking the marina and the pool--and a little bit of the harbor could be viewed. We were very pleased with the room and the service. All employees were very friendly and helpful. The room was spotless. The pool was very clean. We were surprised that we did not hear any airport noise whatsoever! We walked down to the west end of the island one evening and had fun watching the huge ships in the harbor. This hotel is very close to downtown (at the most, 5 minutes drive time--you could probably walk there) and Point Loma. We rented a car and parking was 18 dollars per night, but there is no place in San Diego where you don't have to pay to park, and this was a very secure, guarded lot. There are a lot of areas in San Diego where we visited and parked our car and worried about things being stolen from it, but Harbor Island seemed a very secure place where you could walk around at night and not be concerned about personal safety. We have absolutely no complaints and would stay there again.

<Title>“Never Again”
<Content>I stayed here because it was the location of our convention. The bed wa comfy, but there was one problem after the next. Remote didn't work, Shrek 2 was corrupted and overlaid with porn (a negative?), the first minute of a local call cost $13.00, and the shower curtains are cheap. It's as if the hotel couldn't decide if it wanted to be high class with its 'service promise' or a budget hotel where all the added expense is nickled-and-dimed out of you: phone calls, parking, health club access, etc. The room had stained carpets and felt dingy. I'd choose not to stay here again, and I'll probably skip all Sheratons. One star performance: Chris, the bartender and server in the italian restaurant onsite, is great. I was shocked to find great food and service in this restaurant with the days of disappointment experienced at the hotel.

<Title>“Overall pretty satisfied with the Sheraton”
<Content>We stayed in the West Tower, 11th floor. The view was lovely, the room was larger than expected and very clean. Wonderful linen, good supply of towels. Front desk and attendants were polite and helpful. Parking was not a problem. It is expensive at $16 a night, but that is what most downtown hotels charge. The downside is that it cost $25 to have a refridgerator and there was a shortage of them. There is some airplane noise between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. Nicer amenities at the East Tower (pool, lobby, restaurants, etc.), but the walk did not bother us and the lobby did not matter much to us. Not much around the outside of the hotel except a deli open limited hours. Overall we enjoyed our stay.

<Content>This hotel was great. We stayed five nights in mid August of 2004. The pools were great, the lobby beautiful, and the restaurants delicious. The room was pretty standard, however it was nice to have down pillows and a real comforter, not just a bedspread. The staff was awesome! Although, there were a couple problems.. forgotten hairdryer in the room, no newspaper, and one night the neighbor's alarm went off for about two hours. The good news: Sheraton was more than apologetic.. they gave us $50 off our bill and two free lunch vouchers (a $20 value). This treatment was a nice surprise and much better than just a "sorry". We'll definetely stay there again!

<Title>“very pleased”
<Content>My family had the pleasure of staying at this Sheraton for three nights this mid August. It was the last stretch of our first vacation to California. We had a fabulous time and that included our time at the Sheraton. Upon checkin we were greeted by a very friendly attendant who offered us the option of city or bay view which was very much appreciated. We chose the bay view which also overlooked the pool area and we found it very lovely. The hotel had all the amenities we could have wanted...from a nice restaurant (a bit high, but what hotel restaurant isn't), a beautiful view, take-out food restaurant, beautiful pool area with pool bar, a lounge,a fitness center, my son had a private tennis lesson and it even had a laundry room which was so much appreciated at the end of our trip! The location was very centralized to access all the tourist areas...from la jolla to coronado, downtown to old town, it was all very easy to get to from the Sheraton. The only thing I was kicking myself for was booking my return trip back to Boston from Long Beach, while we could have (should have) left from San Diego....the airport was right across the street! Which by the way, we could hear no airplane noise as the room doors were so airtight. I would definately recommend staying here and hope your stay and service provided to you will be as pleasant as ours. We encountered none of the problems of the previous reviewers. Just a note, we did stay in the east tower.

<Title>“Sheraton San Diego--A Split Personality”
<Content>From 25-28 July my family and I stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel And Marina. While our stay was comfortable, the fact is that this property has a split personality; the East Tower has the lionâ€™s share of facilities/amenities while the West Tower (where we stayed) is the poor neighbor. The West Tower of this property does not match it's sister tower. The hotelâ€™s two towers separated by over 400 yards (a 5-10 minute walk); while I have experienced similar â€œsisterâ€� properties, this is my first experience with a hotel that has such disparate distance AND quality levels between segments of its property. The West Towerâ€™s facilities included a 3-meal restaurant, pool/spa, and gift shop. It lacked the following amenities offered in the East Tower: 1. Concierge service 2. Casual Restaurant/Tavern 3. Lobby Bar 4. Fitness Facility 5. Comprehensive Business Center 6. Pool Restaurant The West Tower just exuded an aura of neglectâ€”the building exterior is in need of refinishing, and the hallways, especially adjacent to meeting spaces, had a musty odor. The pool area was neglected for much of the dayâ€”in several instances, the pool towel supply was exhausted and repeated calls for replenishment for not heeded. The sole bright spot was that the rooms in this tower are comfortable, nicely furnished, and larger than those in the East Tower. There was no mini-bar (West Tower mini-bars had been discontinued), no bathrobe, and no comprehensive Business Center in the West Tower. One (1) of our two (2) phones was not functioning, and building maintenance had to be called to fix it. The second morning of our stay we discovered that our in-room coffee supply had not been replenished. Finally, our room had no phone books. All of these oversights were corrected in a timely fashion, but they added to the effect that you were staying on the â€œwrong side of the street.â€�

<Title>“Not one of the better hotels in the area”
<Content>My family and I stayed for two nights (3 rooms) and we all agreed that other than the main lobby, this hotel is in need of some serious work. The buildings are old and run down. Stained carpets, peeling wallpaper, squeaky elevators, and sporadic hot water. To add to that, the staff was not friendly at all and slow to respond. My brother's room had no towels or coffee maker when he checked in and it took most of the first day to get these items. He had to find a housekeeper's cart to get his own towels. They also overcharge for what they do offer. $10 per day if you want to use their fitness room, $16 for parking, $4 for a bottle of water, etc. I stayed at the Omni in San Diego the week prior and found it to be a much better value. Also, the hotel is not located near any trolley line or public transportation which is an ideal way to get around downtown San Diego. Their shuttle runs from the airport to the hotel, which is only a block away. This is one Sheraton that is in need of a major renovation, including the attitude of its staff. You can do better for your money.

<Title>“Very nice hotel”
<Content>After having read all of the negative reviews of this hotel before our trip, I felt compelled to share my opinion. My family of four just completed a 10 day California coast vacation which ended with two nights in the West Tower, 7/28 and 7/29. We loved it. We had a room on the 10th floor overlooking the marina and the airport. Terrific view. Personally, I love to watch the planes take off. But, since there was very little airplane activity between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., we were able to sleep with the balcony door open and let the cool, fresh San Diego air into the room. The noise was not a problem. We did not use the West Tower pool, but the kids loved the pool at the East Tower with its volley ball net and basketball hoop. Yes, it's a 5 minute walk from one tower to the next, but it's along a beautiful marina. What's not to like about that? A lot of reviewers have complained about the parking situation. Well, our room key did not work in the parking lot the first night, but the attendant was very helpful and let us out without a problem. I got another key from the front desk the next morning and it worked fine. I saw it as a very minor inconvenience. We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants. With all of the great restaurants in San Diego, why would you want to? Take the short drive to Seaport Village, the Gaslamp Quarter, or Old Town. We did have breakfast at the deli along the marina one morning and it was fine. We are looking forward to our next visit to San Diego and we would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Depends on room that you get”
<Content>I have stayed in both the east and west tower. The east tower has the updated standard room that you see at most sheratons. Small but modern furnishings with great beds/bedding. Great for business traveler. Parts of this tower have been renovated and some have not. The concierge lounge with free breakfast was in an outdated area and was unappetizing (but great view). Make sure that you do not get rooms on corner with trash dumpsters below. The noise no matter how high up you are will wake you up. For a more relaxed and leisurley stay, you might request the west tower. If you do make certain to request a renovated room. The rooms on floor 6 on airport was nice with view of harbor, and was charming. Do not (surprisingly enough) stay on the top level. Theses rooms are OUTDATED and musty. Beautiful skylights as you walk down the hallway with nice sconces on the walls but be prepared to better see the dirty stained carpeting. When you get off the elevator it is dark and the furnishings stained. In the rooms, you have a jetted tub but it is a very old model and I was frightened at what might be in the jets. Most requested rooms are the rooms with view of the navy pier. Less noise from airport. But stay higher up so that you do not get noise from parking lot or street. The fitness center was ok even though there was a fee but there is also a nice jogging trail around the dock. Beautiful. Good restaurants in both towers. If you want a hotel convenient to airport this is great but with all the nice hotels in San Diego I don't think that I would choose this one again.

<Title>“Very bad hotel, very bad location...”
<Content>My wife and I just returned from a terrible, noisey, and unfriendly stay here. We booked through an online travel site and got a decent rate of about $110/night. Because we booked through the internet discount site, the hotel was very rude to us, treating us like second class citizens. They actually said if we wanted a decent room (and not the one on the first floor facing the parking lot) that we should re-book our reservation through the hotel. (even though they knew we had pre-paid online which wasn't refundable) The air-conditioning turns off every few minutes and you must get up to turn it back on, all NIGHT!! When we complained, the front desk was extremely unapologetic and truly didn't even PRETEND to care. We heard many other guests complaining and some checked out early as we arrived. We are frequent travelers and have never been treated so badly. There is also tons of airplane noise as it is directly across from the airport and there is NOTHING within walking distance. You must park your car in their lot which will cost you $16/day for self-park, $22 for valet. My other complaint was that concierge recommended bad restaurants to us. In fact, we showed up at one and left as it was a total tourist trap. That really annoyed me. We informed them we were food lovers (we live in NYC and are used to great restaurants--not fancy necessarily---just great food) and we were sent to overpriced, bland places filled with travelers. Everything about our stay was very disappointing. There are much better hotels for the price. I suggest going to stay in a better area where you can walk around and not be constantly alarmed by the planes flying constantly overhead. Stay somewhere where you will be valued and appreciated.

<Title>“Absolute WORST hotel ever!”
<Content>Jeez! I don't know where to begin. Long story short. Hubby and I booked thru Hotwire and paid $103/nt for 3 nt stay. We were treated like peasants for booking with Hotwire and were told we would be getting the only room available, on the first floor overlooking the parking lot. I told rude front desk girl (Anna) that I had checked w/their website that morning and saw tons of availability and that it was our anniversary and we wanted a room overlooking the water. She said no and argued with me for FIFTEEN MINUTES until she finally "unblocked" a room with a view on the 7th floor for and extra $20/nt. (Nice welcome, huh?) FINE! The room was gross. A filthy carpet, and very digustingly stained bedspread. The room was SMALL (and I live in NYC where our standards in the space dept. are seriously below the nat'l average) and the air conditioning would turn off after literally 2 minutes and NEVER go back on unless you got up and pressed the button. Not fun in the middle of the night. When we complained after a sleepless night, they offered no apology and said they'd send an engineer up to fix it. When he arrived, he told us this was how the hotel saves money and that people were constantly annoyed about it. The list goes on and on. The staff TRULY doesn't care, they are completely miserable and apathetic. Don't stay here. There are so many good hotels. I suggest getting away from the airport area in general and staying in a place where you can walk around. The airport noise was definitely annoying as was the $16/day parking fee and the entire experience. I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this disgraceful, no-star hotel.

<Title>“Great West Tower location!”
<Content>I just returned from two nights at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina. When I was told my room was in the West tower, I was a bit concerned after reading the reviews here. However, I couldn't have been more pleased. My room was on the corner of the top floor (12th). It had floor to ceiling windows on two walls with a huge (larger than the room) rooftop patio which I entered through a french door. The patio had two sun lounge chairs, a glass top patio table with four chairs, two additional chairs with a small table, and a potted palm tree. The patio overlooked the wedding garden, pool, marina with boats on the right and across the water to the left was the military helicopter pads and ships. Across the water I saw a fireworks show one evening. The patio area was perfect for enjoying breakfast and the wonderful San Diego weather. When inside the room I didn't hear any airport noise. Rarely outside did I hear airplanes. The interior of the room had plush down comforters and pillows on both beds with soft sheets. The bathroom was large with marble floors, walls, and glass enclosed Jacuzzi tub and shower. The bathroom also had real plants. The sink counter area was large. I heard no noise from any other rooms, never even heard or saw another guest on my floor, though I know there must have been some, since housekeeping was cleaning rooms besides mine. The only negative things I noticed were stains on the carpet, the ice machine on my floor was broken, and I had no remote for the television. These were minor details easily overlooked with the many benefits of this room. I looked forward to returning to this room at the end of each day, and would love to return to this room on another trip!

<Title>“west tower”
<Content>We were at first disappointed when the shuttle driver told us that we were in the west tower, because of the reviews I read here, but our room turned out to be beautiful, we had a great view of harbor, and did not hear any airport noise at all. (we were facing south) They did try to nickel and dime you for everything, and we did not use the gym, because they charged you $10 to do so. What we did for a car rental was use Enterprise, they came and picked us up, and there is free on the street parking right in front of the hotel, in which there were spaces available even during Memorial Day weekend. We used our car for the day, and then turned it in that night (Enterprise allows you to turn it in right there at the hotel) and did not have to pay the ridiculous amount that the hotel wanted for parking. There is a store about a block down with a deli and cheap breakfast, where you can get drinks for your room. Only other complaint was at times there was little hot water.

<Title>“Very Comfortable Room”
<Content>I was there for one night only, on May 15, 2004. I was in San Diego for a wedding, and was not interested in the resort aspects of the hotel. I travel a lot, both on business and pleasure, and found the room, which was in the much criticized west tower, to be well above average. The room was spotless. There was a pillowtop bed with all cotton sheets, which gave me an excellent night's sleep. The bathroom was large and first rate. It had a magnifying mirror at eye level, which was great for putting on makeup; a real blow dryer (not one of those anemic wall types); and a shower that appeared to be tall enough for men over six feet tall, with strong water pressure. The staff was very accomodating, allowing me to check in early and also accompanying me to my room when the first key card that I received did not work properly. The room also seemed to be sound proof; I did not hear any planes from the nearby airport, and also did not hear any noise from the elevator and exterior door that were very close to my room. They do charge too much for the parking ($16) and phone calls ($2 even for local calls and calling card calls). Otherwise, I have no complaints.

<Title>“A motel with a view”
<Content>Beware the "west tower" if you're unlucky enough to be booked at this hotel. This Sheraton is basically a high rise motel with a good view (from some rooms). The scoop is there is the main building and a separate "tower" -- which is essentially another hotel taken over by Sheraton several years ago. The condition of the west tower is poor and the room decor and amenities poorer than poor. My room was so dirty I had to wipe obvious foreign matter off the walls with a wet towel. When I objected at check in to being placed in this Siberia, I was given the brush off and told the West tower was "better" because it used to be a Westin -- huh -- maybe during the Carter administration? Also, if you're attending a convention beware the check out -- there's a shuttle bus but it fills up quickly, leaving people with flights to catch walking the mile to the airport. Finally, if you're not into $20.00 breakfasts, you have the choice of a grim little deli nearby. Nothing, I repeat nothing, is within walking distance of either Sheraton tower.

<Title>“No complaints”
<Content>My wife and I spent the week of May 1, 2004 in San Diego and stayed at the Sheraton on Harbor Island which we got for $90 per night through Priceline. The service was fine, but the prices in the restaurants were so high we went to other places for meals. Too close to the airport to completely relax...especially when the jets started taking off at 6:30 in the morning, and we still wanted to sleep!

<Title>“The West Tower is not a 4 star hotel”
<Content>We stayed 5 days at this hotel (Room 795, April 22-26, 2004) and had a nice time overall in San Diego. We bought a "vacation package" from Hotwire that included this hotel and airplane tickets from San Jose, CA.The staff was all helpful and pleasant (except for one instance described below). The main complaint I have is that I was expecting a 4 star hotel and what I experienced was a 2.5 star facility. We were given a room in the "West Tower". This seems to be the older and more run down half with these deficiencies:1) the single small swimming pool at this tower was not heated and too cold to swim in 2) the room did not have a fridge (had to pay $16 to have one brought in to our room)3) the hotel does not have a VCR even to rent4) our "upgraded" room ($20/night extra) showed signs of age and had elevator noise5) the tub was clogged the first day (they fixed it and gave us a pancake breakfast)6) bathroom light bulbs were burned out our whole stay7) the parking (extra ~$16/day) had a gate entry that never recognized our key and the exit was often delayed with a line of cars8) the elevator closest to our room was very run down, scratched, dingy, but functionalAs a final complaint: We went to the "East Tower" to go swimming since they had a nice large heated pool unlike the "motel" pool at the "West Tower". When we finished swimming, we could not find a bathroom or dressing room of any type to change in. When we asked the fitness center attendant where we could change she treated us like we were'nt even guests. She asked what room we were staying in (what does that matter?) and when I told her we were in the West Tower room 795 she said we would have to pay a fee to use the fitness center dressing room. I told her that was ridiculous and she suggested that we walk through the adjacent restaurant and into a single bathroom and change there.... we were treated like second class citizens. When reading the Sheraton hotel description you sure don't get the glaring distinction between the towers.Again, my complaint is that I was sold a "4 star" hotel and what I got was much lower than that standard.Al Tadros

<Title>“Loved the Hotel -- Would stay again”
<Content>We stayed for 3 days. Yes, it is very close to the airport. So if you are arriving late, you will be in a comfy bed in no time. I did not consider the airport noise to be a bother at all, and there were no flights after 10pm anyway. We stayed in the West Tower. The rooms were huge and very nicely appointed king rooms. The views from the balcony are great from any side of the hotel you are on. The East Tower does have a different configuration, but has the nicer pool, fitness facilities and restaurants. There is a short walk along the marina between the two towers. They also have a shuttle to take you if would rather. Airport shuttles run every less-than-15 minutes. You are about 2-3 miles from downtown San Diego and the cruise pier. A cab would run you about $7. They have a great bike/jogging trail around the island and to the city. We rented bikes from the hotel in the morning and biked the 15-20 min ride into downtown San Diego and had nice breakfast. The staff at the Sheraton West Tower was very awesome and really knew how to take care of things very well. The only bad thing I would say about the hotel is that there is no cafe in the West Tower, the pool was freezing and the housekeeping staff needs more training. They often forgot to finish the job before moving on to the next room. We would and look forward to staying there again.

<Title>“Too Isolated, Too Noisy, Bad Parking, Bad Choice”
<Content>My wife, two kids (ages 7 and 3), and I stayed in the East Tower from April 6-9. We upgraded to the 15th floor Club Level (the highest floor on which their are lodging rooms), free self-parking (normally $16 per night), and free continental breakfast (normally $11.95 per person). The hotel is on a man-made island adjacent to the airport. With the exception of a walking trail around the marina, the hotel is not walking distance to anything. The room itself was fairly small (approximately 10 feet wide and 20 feet long (including the bathroom)), furnishing nicely and in good condition (except for some mold on the ceiling above the shower/tub). It had a sliding door leading to a small balcony with a view of a good portion of the marina, and further away, downtown San Diego. We checked in at night and the view of the city lights was very nice. However, within a matter of minutes we were assaulted by the noise of airplanes taking off, seemingly directly over our room. The airplane noise decreased after 10 p.m. but during the night the air conditioning system made a loud metallic kicking noise when it turned on. The aiplanes returned at about 5 a.m. We could also hear a lot of motorcycle and other fast moving vehicle traffic from the street below. On our last night, we heard a child crying all night in the room next to ours. The self-parking is limited to those spaces farthest from the hotel; the spaces that are near the hotel are reserved for valet parking. The first night I had to hunt for about 10 minutes to find a parking space, and it was about 250 yards from the lobby. I found slightly closer parking spots for our second and third nights but they were still unacceptably far away. The continental breakfast is a buffet on the Penthouse level. Each day the selection was the same: nice pastries, bread for toasting, dry cereal in individual boxes, Yoplait yogurts, and fruit salad (watermelon, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, strawberries, pineapple, and a few blue berries). To drink, there is coffee, tea, milk and orange juice. There are about 10-12 tables, all of which have table clothes and a view of the marina. There were usually two waitresses, but their job is to clean up and keep the buffet stocked; they do not serve food. There are much better places to stay in San Diego. I have stayed in many hotels in San Diego, including the Sheraton's West Tower twice (it is better than the East Tower), and the Sheraton Suites (nice rooms but weird lobby and inconvenient loaction). If you want to be near the airport, in addition to the two Sheraton properties, there is also a Hilton (I have not stayed there). The convention center is not very far from the airport and there are many hotels near it. If you want to be able to walk to the beach, you need to choose a hotel in a different area of town. If you want to go to Sea World or the Zoo, there are also better places to stay. In sum, there really is no reason to stay at this Sheraton, it is noisy, the parking is bad, and it is not near anything other than the airport.

<Title>“Loved the Sheraton”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton San Diegofrom 3/25/04-3/31/04. We booked through a discount website and got an incredibly low rate ($94/night).After booking the trip, I read the reviews that had been posted and began to get very nervous about our choice. When we arrived, we went to the East tower, as it is the first one you come to. Before we even got out of the car the valet checked a list he had and told us that we were in the West tower, right around the corner. We were told at check-in that we had a limited-view room. We opted to upgrade for $20 a night to a room on the 9th floor with a gorgeous view of the bay and the navy base. (We really enjoyed watching the navy ships and cruise ships come and go.) The hotel was great. The room was clean and all of the employees were very pleasant during our stay. We had room service three of the nights and it was very good.We were told at check-in that they were having problems with the keycard access to the parking lot. They said just to take a ticket to enter the lot and then throw the ticket away. The card worked fine to exit the lot. We didn't find this at all inconvenient.While it was slightly annoying paying $16/night to park, when combined with our nightly rate, it was still much cheaper than published rates for this hotel.The only complaint we had was the airconditioning in the room. It would shut off during the night and the room would get too warm. This meant getting up and turning the unit back on. There is a small deli/store located at the marina between the East and West towers. We had breakfast there each morning. It was very good.The location of the hotel was very convenient to all locations. We will definitely stay here again.

<Title>“No complaints here”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Resort from March 19-March 24 and were thrilled with our choice!!! We had booked at Sheraton.com and had a great rate! We were on vacation for the week and stayed on the 11th floor in the west tower. We coudn't have been happier with the view of the naval habor with the carriers and other boats going by. The staff was friendly, courteous and we never had a problem with parking, the taking of the ticket was quick and easy. Being located on Habor Island Drive was an easy access to everything we wanted to do, although if staying here a car is a must. We had a great deal with a convertible for 12 days with Budget with unlimited miles for $250!The rooms were large, spacious, well cleaned while we were there and the front desk employees were friendly and helpful. When we arrived we did go check out the east tower, which I thought had a nice lobby and outside area. We never had time to go to any of the pools although they looked very nice.When going back we will stay at this hotel again!
