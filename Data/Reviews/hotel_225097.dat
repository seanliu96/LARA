<Content>Phenomenal stay at this exceptional hotel & resort . I wouldn't hesitate to revisit this place with my family next time. It's worth every dollar & the dinning spots within the resort are great too. I salute the entire Gaylord Palms Hotel & Resort staff members for exhibiting & delivering excellent customer care for us travelers.

<Title>“Great for trips to Disney”
<Content>The Gaylord Palms is one of my favorite hotels. I usually stay here when we take trips to Disney World, it is just a short drive to Disney and more for your money than any of the Disney hotels I have stayed at. It is simply beautiful, well maintained and huge! The rooms are very clean and staff is helpful. The resort food is pricey so we usually eat out. There will be added parking and resort fees added to your bill (around $33 per day) but to me it is worth the extra price. It is a great resort, we always have a nice time here.

<Content>Lovely hotel room & facilities. Gym is great. Housekeeping was so nice and every last detail was thought of. Front desk was also very helpful when I needed to get back into the room after checking out for something left behind. Great stay if youre looking to stick to one place and maybe do a few day trips.

<Title>“No need to leave the place but bring snacks.”
<Content>So I have stayed here before and they have upgraded the places to eat and drink. They have a new sports bar which is very cool. Everything comes with a price. Parking and resort fees are over $30 a day. I had a sandwich and a bottle of water and it was $15. They had a line for tip- for what, putting a sandwich on a counter? If you are a family of 4, plan on spending a fortune. The pool area has been upgraded and is fun for little kids.

<Title>“Orlando Business Hotel”
<Content>First time at this property during a recent convention. This property is very popular in my industry as I have another convention here next year. Hotel, restaurants etc. have just undergone a $50 million dollar upgrade. Self contained property with various restaurants for varying tastes and a large pool. The rooms are very nice and the service was very good. These types of properties are a bit like Las Vegas, but they serve a purpose for business travelers and convention goers. Very close to Disney.

<Title>“Surprise Charges”
<Content>We are locals, and decided to do a staycation at this resort...because it's my birthday month, we received a second night free...we planned to stay saturday and sunday night...however, the beds were awful and the noise from the atrium kept us up all night...so we opted to just hang out at the new splash park (which is above average for a pool facility for kids) and go home sunday night...our out of pocket for the one night stay was $280...ok, no problem...then nearly a week later I get a surprise charge of an extra $70...I called to find out what that was for, and was given a vague explanation that it was a resort fee and included self parking charges...so for a one night stay, not including any food or extras, we ended up spending 350 bucks...bottom line, there are much better options in this price range in orlando

<Title>“Fantastic property!!!!”
<Content>This hotel is only about 30 minutes from the Orlando International airport and a fantastic shopping/dining center in Winter Garden, and only about 5 minutes to Walt Disney World theme parks. They provide complimentary bus transportation to the Walt Disney World theme parks. At the time we visited, the buses were departing the hotel once an hour and picking up at the theme parks about every two hours. We rented a car from Hertz at the airport and returned it to the hotel. The exterior hotel grounds did not contain signs to Hertz or Rental Car Return and returning the car after hours can be a bit confusing. If you return your car to the hotel Hertz location, you would leave the car and keys with the valet located at the front entrance of the hotel. We stayed in a newly refurbished room in the Everglades wing on the third floor facing the atrium. The room was exceptionally nice and if you love the sound of water falling, you'll love leaving the french doors open at night and falling asleep. I did not have the opportunity to eat in the restaurants on the property but heard from many people (including the locals) that the Old Hickory Steakhouse is quite an experience with excellent steak and fantastic service. The menu is $$$. The room rate included the fitness center which was well appointed. They had everything from treadmills, elliptical machines and stair steppers to a row machine, weights, balance balls, kettle balls and resistance bands. I also had a need to utilize their on-site laundry facility that contains 2 apartment style washers and dryers. It costs $5 to wash and dry ($2.50/each) and requires the use of tokens or quarters. They also have a vending machine with laundry detergent and dryer sheets for $1/each. Note: One dry cycle did not result in completely dry clothes. This is a property that I would recommend staying at if wanting to be close everything. Although the rooms are a bit expensive, the accommodations, amenities, service, and expansive property are worth the price.

<Title>“Convention Center Central”
<Content>I've stayed at the Gaylord Palms a number of times now on business travel ans part of a large group. The complex is huge. A few tips: 1. Try to get a room NOT facing in towards the atrium - it can get loud out there on nights where there is something going on at the performance stage. 2. There are baby alligators over by the gym - follow the paths to check them out - especially if you are with kids. 3. The gym gets BUSY very early in the morning. If you are there for a convention plan to arrive right when it opens. If you are there with family - skip that early morning work out and wait for the business folks to head off to their meetings by 8. 4. The hotel sells special convention park passes if you are there with a convention. For a reduced price (about $50) you can enter the Disney resorts at 4pm. This is not an advertised option - so ask when you check in. The hotel also runs shuttles to the parks.

<Title>“Hotel is excellent, staff is friendly, restaurants are expensive, close to DW”
<Content>Convention again...Had been to this hotel 11 years ago and knew enough to have a car so that we could get away to other food options. (Self-Parking is $15 per day. Take a right out of hotel lot to get to restaurants and stores...Walgreens, McDonalds, Cracker Barrel, Marshalls, Target, gas stations, etc.) The hotel is clean, fun, interesting (all covered, atrium hotel). There's shopping, fish ponds, pools, bars, restaurants and a spa. I have been told the Steakhouse restaurants is VERY expensive but good. We were at a convention...the food served at the convention was VERY marginal so I will not judge any of the restaurants without having eaten at one. There are options for drinks and snacks in the hotel as well. Wireless internet in the hotel was seamless and instant. Rooms have single cup coffee maker...and a fridge (in dresser). Enjoy your stay!!

<Title>“Best hotel in Kissimmee”
<Content>I love the Gaylord (name makes me laugh). The hotel is always spotless, the service great and the different restaurants make for a unique and interesting dining option. The steakhouse is by far the best. The meat is flavorful and tender and the decor is classy "old Florida" like Henry Flagler's local eatery. The property is huge though and parking is a little bit of a nightmare but it's worth it. It's also close to most attractions. In the winter they make it snow! The pool is also very nice. It's a great hotel that stands above the rest in Orlando.

<Title>“Excellent!!!!!!”
<Content>My family (myself, hubbie, 4 & 8 year old) stayed at the Gaylord Palms from April 7-13, 2012. This hotel is excellent. Once you get over the fact that you have to pay $15 to park and they have a resort fee you will see that this place is wonderful. We budgeted all of these extras in our vacation. We also rented a car so we could drive to the parks on our own and we did not eat at any of the restaurants so I cant comment on that. The Gaylord Palms recently opened a water park for the children (and adults) and it is completely awesome!! They are four slides and a bucket that dumps gallons of water on everyone (there is a warning bell so if you dont want to get wet you can run away!) I went through the water house and also did all of the slides and felt it was totally safe for my children. I saw no children slipping and falling (not to say that its impossible) but who ever built this took the time to take all of this into consideration. They have staff throughout the waterpark and even at the bottom of the water slides. The childrens pool goes no deeper then 3 feet 9 inches and there is also zero entry. They had plenty of pool toys and there were plenty of pool chairs, umbrellas and plenty of towels. The hotel has put families as a priority in their upgrading and I think this is wonderful. There is also an adult pool for people 18+ and they also seemed very happy. We also saw trucks coming in with plants that were ready to be planted. So many upgrades going on and the rooms also have been done over. Our rooms were cleaned every morning and every staff member we passed by always said 'good morning' or 'have a nice day'. They also have a representative talking about the alligators that live at the resort and he was also educating the crowd which was fascinating to the children and adults!! This place should be number one!! It is an experience like no other!! Thank you Gaylord Palms for a wonderful vacation!!! We will be back!!

<Title>“Beautiful grounds, nice rooms.”
<Content>We stayed here for a meeting Feb 2012 for a few days. The hotel grounds are set-up similar to the Gaylord hotel at Opryland in Nashville, (although a smaller facility), which you would expect since they are owned by the same group. However, the grounds at The Palms are much nicer than in Opryland. We had a room with a balcony that overlooked the beautiful palm-filled atrium which was large and clean. The bed was very comfortable. Room service is very expensive and the food is fair. There are several restaurants in the hotel to choose from, and our food was average-but much better than Gaylord-Opryland. Good hotel for business and conventions, not so much for a 'vacation' or 'get-away'.

<Title>“Nice resort - Conference friendly”
<Content>I stayed at this resort in March 2012 while attending a conference at the center attached to the hotel. The rooms are large and while the decor feels dated it is a more traditional hotel. The bed was very comfortable and the room and hotel were very clean. I did try the restaurants on the property and they were average to good. The steak house is pricey but the meals were very good. There was construction on the water park which is right next to the pool. This would have been a negative had I been trying to relax by the pool. The water park was closed during construction. I'm not familiar with other hotels in the area and have always stayed at Disney World when visiting but this seems like a good option if you are staying outside OS the park. There is an upscale outlet mall about 10 minutes away as well.

<Title>“Very Nice Hotel”
<Content>Came here for a conference for work. Hotel is very beautiful; had a balcony opening onto the atrium which was a very nice feature considering there are no exterior balconies (and nothing to look at outside the hotel). There is currently construction around the hotel due to some updating going on. Nice, but a little annoying during the day. The pool area is beautiful, but was full most of the weekend and it was tough to get a chair at "prime time". The food is good, but very expensive even in a nice hotel. Loved the bath and shower, but the bed was absolutely terrible. Hard as a rock, and the pillows were flat and left a lot to be desired. Other than that, the hotel is beautiful. If you have allergies be prepared- they WILL be bad due to the number of flowering plants and trees in an enclosed area. Its like living in a greenhouse. Be sure the check out each of the "areas" of the hotel, like the FLorida Keys, the Everglades, etc. Great photo opportunities. I also got my hair done in the spa which was high quality and everyone complimented me on. It was $90 including tip, which isn't terrible for the high end hotel spas.

<Content>My 27 year old daughter and I stayed here while going to Disney and Universal. What a wonderful and special site this is. Everywhere we went the service was remarkable, and it was fun exploring the different themed areas. We asked for a quiet room and stayed in the Everglades area, which was perfect. We had quick and easy access to everything. Try the Rooms for Good package or any of the other packages they offer, we received a fabulous price and free breakfast each day. I wish we could have stayed longer!

<Content>We we amazed how well organized was this event ath the Gaylord palms in kissimmee. It is a huge property, the convention center perfectly located on the back of hotel, with plenty of ballrooms for meetings or practice for the cheerleading competition. Accomodation is excelent, rooms are spacious and very clean. Staff is very warm and friendly. Food is great, a litlle expensive though.The kids enjoyed a lot the new pool and the slides. You cannot invite any guest at the pool area, they are not allowed... but guest will be allowed everywhere else, specially to the restaurants. Great stay!

<Content>I inadvertendly forgot to contact Gaylord to change the date if my arrival for a National Conference of which I was a scheduled presenter. My reservation subsequently was cancelled and sold. Gaylord was literally sold out and there wasn't another hotel within 45 miles of the Convention Center. The Gaylord staff worked really hard to see to it that I received acommodations and was successful. They went above and beyond the call! I received awesome acommodations! I strongly recommend the Gaylord Palms and would stay there again if in the area.

<Title>“Outside the Convention-al”
<Content>Just returned from a 5 day convention stay at the Gaylord Palms Resort & Convention Center in Kissimmee, Florida. This is one of the four Gaylord Hotels, and I have stayed at two others. This hotel is a fully enclosed atrium hotel with outstanding service and great amenities. First and foremost, the front desk staff person, April, did a fantastic job in changing my room from a double to a king, and upgraded my room at the same time. Besides helping me with the room, she outlined the hotel, gave me an information packet, and was very professional. The room was very nicely appointed with a great inside veranda that looked over the lagoon. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was nice with two sinks and a great shower. The convention center attached to the hotel is very large, and very easy to travel to from the hotel and back. The flowers, fish, alligators, and greenery in the atrium was excellent. Andy, the bellman, did a great job ensuring my suits were pressed and back to me as asked, without a hitch, even though he picked them up at midnight, and they were returned at 10:30 AM. This hotel is expensive, particularly the restaurants and shops. There is free bus service to downtown disney and other locations. Overall, great hotel and great stay.

Hotel was very large so even though there was a cheerleader convention we were not disturbed by the noise. Can't speek highly enough about the staff, service, or the grounds. Simply amazing. Would highly recommend this hotel for families and couples alike.

<Title>“We Didn't Want to Leave!”
<Content>We spent the weekend here in order to attend a volleyball tournament at ESPN (10 minutes away. So is Disney). The rest of our group stayed at Disney's All Star. We got the better deal. EVEY SINGLE staff member we encountered was helpful and/or pleasant. No exceptions. The grounds were clean and beautifully landscaped, the room was recently renovated, and the gym was top notch (best hotel gym I've EVER been in bar none). Sure...the main pool was closed (opening soon) and being made into a water park. The pool that is open is 180 feet long. It worked just fine. How do I know its 180 feet? On every phone there is a "just ask" button. ANYTHING you need or want? Just ask. There were multiple restaraunts on the grounds and we didn't even venture out to downtown Disney. There was no need. The sports bar (watched the NCAA semis) was incredible and 20 of us ate dinner in a room at the rear. We visited the All Star during our stay and stood, slack-jawed in the Walmart-like food court staring at the dated and dirty conditions. Then we thanked our stars that we chose the Gaylord.

<Content>Spent three days there at a recent conference. The hotel is very clean, nice and large. They have several large patios and lots of sheltered areas for hanging out. Rooms are average..but clean. Onsite restaurants are ok...their steakhouse is excellent...the rest are average. They have a nice large sports bar. Pool area is under some construction and it looks like it will be great once complete. Room rates were good so for Orlando the value was good. The convention center itself is very nice, clean, etc. All the service staff that I interacted with we're very professional. I have no problem recommending this resort for a short stay or a great steak

<Title>“There is better hotels out there...”
<Content>My husband and I went to the Gaylord Palms as a last minute spontaneous weekend trip. We did not see our confirmation email til well after check-in that warned us that the main pool was closed. This was very upsetting to say the least as our 9 year old son was very very dissapointed. The plain rectangle pool was open, but being the only pool open it was naturally swamped with people. We decided to try and make the best of it by exploring the inside and found that to be quite fun, but after 1 hour we had seen everything and were bored again. We went to the sunset sams ship to get a drink and listen to live music there (thought there would be a whole band as pictured in their advertisement but only one guy and a guitar who went on break just as we arrived) and as we stood at the bar (inside building bar, not the ship bar) we could not believe that the bartender was just jibber jabbering away with 2 other employees and never even acknowledged us for over 15 minutes. I went back to the hostess stand to ask her if we could just get a table because there appeared to be plenty of waitstaff helping diners and perhaps we would have better luck geting a drink that way but alas the few empty tables that were there were apparently being held for reservations and we were just plain out of luck. We gave up and went back to our room... I would also highly suggest they add a bench to the kids game room as my son wanted to spend a lot of time there with nothing else to do and I being a 42 year old woman did not want to play games nor sit in an awkward racegar game seat so was left standing for hours there... There were other problems I wont bother to detail... Overall very dissatisfied with this hotel.

<Title>“Great Destination from family to Business Stay”
<Content>Attended a 5 day 4 night stay April 2012 in the Emeral Bay rooms of the hotel which is recommended for business accommodations and they have a traditional feel and look. The resort is has everything you need beneath the beautiful skyview roof atrium. You must check out the website and all information is true to the actual facility. The hotel staff were very pleasant and the resort is so clean everywhere you go. The spa is a treat, the rain forest like atrium is an illusion of being outdoors although you are still inside and the outdoor lap pool and and two spa tubs are refreshing when you crave naturual sunlight. You just have to experience the Gaylord for yourself. The room rate is worth it. For a family vacation I recommend the Sunset Guest rooms which are more modern in feel and look.

<Title>“A Very Good Stay”
<Content>Just spent the last 4 days here for a conference. I will summarize the good and the bad with additional comments. Room on 6th floor in St. Augustine area. Newly remodeled, very clean, very comfortable bed and furniture. Balcony was a plus, with 2 chairs. Modern and fresh. In room amenities include lots of towels, coffee, 2 waters per day, wired and wireless Internet, shampoo/conditioner/lotion, and hair dryer. Ask for a room in this remodeled area, as everything is spotless. Several gift shops with snacks and beverages. Newly opened sports bar called Wreckers with good food and service. The Sunset Sam's ship restaurant was average; very pricey compared to quality of the food. Drinks and service were good. Old Hickory steak house was fantastic. Great service and food. Nice evening ambiance. The Mediterranean restaurant in the middle was the hub for breakfast with a decent buffet. Again, good service. I ordered room service twice (Reuben w/fries, then breakfast) and both times it was hot and good. The conference facilities were outstanding. There are no bellboys attempting to help with luggage, which was odd. I could have asked but decided to just handle by three bags as best as possible. People dragging bags all over the large property was again strange. The resort is expensive, but with that you get the benefits of mostly well-mannered people and respectful behaviors from kids and adults alike. The grounds are immaculate and the lush gardens and waterfalls are amazing. Having the balcony doors open at night was lovely to hear the water and smell the flowers. Door slamming was a problem. Not a lot of lunch options, unless you order room service or head to the sports bar. I did discover the coffee cafe had sandwiches and fruit; may I suggest advertising this around the resort to help people find a bite to eat. Used the business center twice. Very convenient, but also expensive for printing and Internet usage. Plenty of cabs and towncars ready to take you anywhere. We went to Celebration and dined at Antonio's. It was very good but be sure to make reservations. All in all a lovely stay but at a cost.

<Title>“Perfect hotel and great location!”
<Content>The hotel is very nice! We went here for Spring Break 2012. It was a great location for Universal Studios and the Astros training camp in Kissimmee. They have a free shuttle bus to all Disney theme parks, but not Universal or Island Of Adventure. We loved the South Beach pool, even though we would have loved to enjoy the new kids pool, but not quite finished with it yet. This hotel was gorgeous inside and out. The rooms were very roomy, comfortable beds, and quiet at night. Would stay here again!

<Title>“Noisy and way overpriced!”
<Content>My husband and I have spent the last four days at the Gaylord in Kissimmee, Fl for a USPS conference - our room was 6321. Our first problem was we were quoted a group rate of $269 night and charged $300+ a night but finally on the third go around got it adjusted. The $269 is a pretty steep rate considering nearby hotels are charging $129 (Hilton) per night. As my husband had a display booth, it would easiest for us to stay on site and we figured it would be a more adult experience. The rooms are so noisy! We could hear the couple next door doing the "nasty". We got a good laugh the first time but it got old in the middle of the night - when we both were awakened. The door slamming never stopped!!!!!! When I mentioned it to staff, there comment was people complain of that all the time - really! fix it! Please put some mechanism on the doors to ease the doors closed. The children running up and down the halls, screaming off of the balconies, hitting the walls and yelling at all hours of the days and nights. I know they are on vacation but I do not want to hear their noise. I am here for work. Consider grouping rooms by adults only sections or floors. Room rates - here's the interesting part. We got the special group rate and then a friend of ours just drove up with no reservation and got a room for two nights at the rate of $207 per night. I guess the only thing "special" about our group rate is they saw us coming!!!! Do not plan on drinking anything here the beer was $7 each and the wine was $8 per small glass of house red or white. My husband and his friend drink Yuengling and the Key West were out of it from Sunday night until Tuesday - they "had trouble getting it from their supplier". Really??? I would be getting a new restuarant supply person. You should never be out of an item when it appears on your menu. If you are going to charge me a fortune - have what I want. On a good point the Shrimp salad was excellent but you might want to add a fish sandwich and some lunch choices that are seafood but not fried. I am pretty sleep deprived and ready to go home. I hope the Gaylord reads these comments and takes them to heart - the grounds are beautiful but soundproofing is sorely required. Just. Ome walk around - spend the night somewhere else!

<Title>“Gaylord Palms truly is a grand hotel.”
<Content>I stayed at the Gaylord Palms for one night in March and 6 nights in the month of February. This hotel is truly a beautiful property with the wow factor even before you walk in. This hotel is a true Orlando resort with great amenities and service. The two biggest draw backs are the parking fees which are completely ridiculous and the overall cost for the rooms. If you are looking to stay here I highly recommend researching the area and using Hotwire or Priceline to get a good deal. The pool is nice and the kiddie water park is almost completed. I highly recommed both the Mediteranean buffet and Wreckers in the hotel for lunch and dinner.

<Title>“Lovely hotel for business conferences”
<Content>I recently attended a sales conference at the Gaylord Palms and was very pleased with accomodations and the ease of navigating this hotel. Unlike other Gaylord properties, the Palms resort did not seem SO huge, so it was easy to walk from the conference area to the rooms. Unlike some large resorts, I did not need a map or a bread crumb trail to find my way around. :) The staff was welcoming and helpful. I had a lovely room facing the atrium area, and it was very pleasant to sit on my balcony. The concierge was terrific and spent a great amount of time assisting us with dinner reservations and transportation. I am not sure that I would chooose this hotel for a family stay, as I think there are more family-friendly and less expensive options in the Orlando area. However, for business and conferences, it was really nice and enjoyable.

<Title>“Definitely for the Rich.........”
<Content>An absolutely beautiful venue with stunning grounds and interesting wildlife.....can you say alligators and turtles swimming about? I was there for a conference with my husband. He said the conference facilities were great and everything was very accessible. From my standpoint, the rooms were average...with only a desk chair or the bed for seating. And the restaurant prices for both food and drink were very high. However, given the location of the property you are at their mercy unless you have a car. How about $22 for a buffet breakfast! Great if you're on an expense account, but tough if you have children.

<Title>“A Must See In Orlando, Florida”
<Content>Disneyland, Sea World, Island of Adventure, etc. are not the only 'must see's' in Orlando! If you've done the theme parks and are are looking for something different, a walk through the Gaylord Palms Resort and Convention Center will give you that something different. Better yet, stay a few nights and experience all this hotel has to offer. Begin in Key West, trek through the Castillo de San Marcos, and end your adventure in the Everglades. While a little on the pricey side, it really is a must see in Orlando, Fla!

<Title>“Beautiful Resort but way overpriced”
<Content>I booked two nights at this resort as a little getaway from Tampa with my girlfriend. I booked the Presidential Suite through Groupon for $199/night (usually goes for $600!). The resort itself is gorgeous in every way but you are deffinitly paying for it. I have a hard time grasping how a hotel can charge you $16/night to park your car in it. Should I just parachute out of a plane to get there instead next time?! Room: The room was very clean and spacious. The bathroom was huge and although two sinks would have been nice, we made it work. There was no balcony on the room and I could never imagine paying $600 to stay in it. Service: This was deffinitly the best part of the resort. All the employees were very nice and always willing to help or even just talk about whatever. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out we had nothing bad to say about any employee. Food: The food was good but the prices of the food were outrageous! We booked the resort because it had multiple restaurants and so that we did not have to travel anywhere. The first night we ate on the "boat" which was pretty neat but the prices for a casual dinner were just too much. A rum and coke was $11.75! My girlfriend had a glass of wine for $10. You could have bought a bottle of the wine she drank for 10 bucks! The second night we went to celebration and had a lot bigger meal and more drinks for way cheaper! Pool: Unfortunetly we were a couple weeks to early as the new kids pool area is still under construction and should be completed soon. This meant that the pool we were at was full of out of control kids with parents that of course have no respect for other people. The pool was HUGE and very clean but between the construction noise and the brats running around, it was not very relaxing.. Overall, I would not stay here again. The resort is gorgeous and the food was good but the prices were just too much. I am by no means a cheapass but an $11.75 drink is crossing the line!

<Title>“A great convention hotel”
<Content>I have been to the Gaylord in Washington DC and now having now been to the Gaylord in Florida, I must say the company does a wonderful job. The convention center at the hotel in Kissimmee was very convenient and unlike many conference centers it was actually close enough you could return to your room during the day without it being a major hike back to the conference. The restaurants are nice and provided plenty of variety for the 3 days we were there. We didn't leave the facility during our three day stay because of the busy conference schedule but did not feel at all confined at this facility. If you are attending a conference at this facility, you will be pleased. While this would not be my first choice for a family vacation location, there were still plenty of families I noticed that came along to take in the sites while one of the parents attended the conference.

<Title>“Bad Food, Bad Service, Bad Experience”
<Content>The food available in all of the "restaurants" is tasteless, questionable, and way, way overpriced. Service is nearly non-existent and orders never correct. The room was blood stained, foul smell from the bathroom, and who taught these people how to make beds, clowns? It cost over $100 for a family of four to get an inedible breakfast with Shrek, who hung out a total of 5-10 minutes? Not even enough time for all the kids that wanted to get pictures with him.

<Title>“Great experience”
<Content>I was here recently for a conference and thought this hotel was great. Their checkin process is very organized. The rooms are very clean and modern (I was in a renovated room) and the bed is very comfortable. There are several restaurants (prices are high) so you don't really need to leave the property. The staff is very helpful and friendly. There are beautiful flowers everywhere and the grounds are meticulous. There were two conferences going on at the same time and they were able to handle it quite well. Very close to Disney World and other area attractions.

<Title>“Gaylord Conference Center”
<Content>I've stayed at this hotel several times, but this time they were sold out and I was only there for a convention. It made me realize why I wished that I stayed there instead of a nearby hotel in the "M" family that I wish I didn't stay at. To start, the hotel is gorgeous inside and out. The new sports bar is AWESOME, and has quality food. You'll hear people complaining about costs at Gaylords in general, but the reality is you get a good quality meal. Is it a little pricey? Yes. BUT, you don't have to drive anywhere, and save on cab/driving, etc. Said differently, you pay for the convenience, and to me, it's well worth it. I can't comment on the rooms this time as I said I didn't stay on site. So, lets talk about the conference center. Suggestion: Make sure you bring shoes meant for walking. The Gaylord Palms has HUGE and expansive conference space. While this is a great thing for big conferences and sessions, it means you will be walking a lot! From the atrium to the conference center is a good walk....then, walking within the conference center itself can be pretty extensive. Summary: Comfy shoes a must! Food at the conference was above average, drinks served promptly at all breaks, friendly staff to point you in the right direction when you go astray, and plenty of place to break away from the conference for meetings both inside as well as out. Suggestion - - on the lower level of the conference center, walk to the very far end to find some chairs/couches that you can use for meetings/break-outs.

<Content>I was down there for a conference and while it is a great place for something like this, the feeling of the hotel was as if a city was placed in a bubble. The rooms were nice and the service was great but the place was just too big and the effect of the atrium and the forest in the middle came off tacky in my opinion.

<Title>“WORTH THE PRICE!”
<Content>Me and my wife wanted to spend quality time together before Christmas. I am a New Yorker and mostly every year I attend the Rockettes Christmas show, but not for this year. I never believed that anything could top the Rockettes Christmas show. We were pleasantly greeted at the reception. We checked up to our room and we had a great vista of the interior hotel landscape from the patio. The interior is well lighted by skylight glass roofing you get a sense of being outdoors. I know it's kind of hard to think of Christmas in 80 degree warm temperature but when we sat on the veranda overlooking the interior landscape scenery live Christmas music began to play and Christmas lighting made it all spectacular. As we enjoyed the music and surroundings we took a stroll in the interior and exterior of the hotel. There were about 3 exterior sections in the hotel under construction so that was a bit disappointing. However, the interior Christmas decor and village like interior landscape was quite lovely. We also attended the "Shrek Ice Show" which was quite impressive. Every year they have a different theme for their ice show. I highly recommend this hotel. The customer service went out of their way to accommodate us when we were out of towels and bottled water.

With Rivers, a St. Augustine Theme replica, salt water area with Red-fish and Tarpon, a boat and several great restaurants, all under a huge glass roof. Even a Alligator swamp. Very cool place. Great for meetings and so. Not the place to go for kids.

<Title>“Continues to deliver...”
<Content>I attend an annual conference at the Gaylord Palms, and have stayed here for the last three years. They always go above and beyond on customer service. Down to a courtesy call shortly after I had checked in, to make sure everything went smoothly. I have consistently had great luck as both a guest and as a conference attendee. Their conference services teams have always been pleasant and more than accommodating. My rooms have always been top notch, and staff are always courteous. Of all the four Gaylord properties that I have stayed at, the Gaylord Palms is my favorite. I'd recommend it highly.

<Content>I stayed at this hotel for a conference. It is a very nice hotel with lots of interesting features on-site. The property is quit large with a huge terrarium filled with tropical plants, streams, live juvenial alligators, live turtles, stores and restaurants. The outside grounds are also very nice with pools, fire pits, a large turf field and new water park (still under constuction). There are shuttles to the Disney attractions every half hour. This is a nice hotel for either work events or leisure. Not inexpensive, but reasonable for what you get.

<Title>“Conference then 4 days rest and relaxation”
<Content>I love this hotel. It's big but has a friendly feel to it; all the staff are helpful, the rooms are spotless, free wifi, free bottled water, big fluffy towels and lots of pillows in crisp white linen. Our room overlooked the inside of the hotel which is a huge atrium filled with trees, flowers, koi, turtles, alligators and a fortress. Lots of eating choices but Sunset Sam's bar was our favorite with great service from Shaun and Carlos. Only downside was the spa - totally overpriced, great facility but staffed by people who really wouldn't know good spa service if they fell over it. I was here for a 3 day conference (facilities were great) then stayed on to chill and experience Orlando for the first time. There are free shuttles to the parks and good value shuttle to the airport. It's not the cheapest of hotels but is great for a treat.

<Title>“Very pricey, but lovely”
<Content>Stayed here while attending a Conference. I went for the " upgrade" room pitch and for $280 a night had a HUGE room with a lovely balcony overlooking the main lobby which is really a giant terrarium with palm trees and all kinds of lush tropical vegetation, koi ponds and even a creek filled with juvenile gators! King size bed was wonderful. Color scheme so neutral it is almost drab though. Could use some brighter pastels. Stayed 2 nights , and never had housekeeping which I found very annoying for the price! I was gone from room 7to 8 hours a day so no excuse like they could not get in! Be sure to try the buffet at the Villa Flores Rest ... It is well worth it and they make the best Sangria I had had outside of Spain! The pool iatea is much too small right now, but they are building a water park on site that will be great for the kids when it opens this June. What really ticked me off was that they had the nerve to charge a dollar a cup for coffee at the convention center! It should be compliamentary! Thats just downright cheap! Overall, this is a nice venue but very expensive, and they need to get on top o their housekeeping staff.

<Title>“Fake Florida”
<Content>I'll start off by saying that I am not a fan of the whole Gaylord concept - huge facilities with enormous atriums and faux attractions mimicking the local tourist attractions. Having said that, this is a beautiful hotel and I can see why it attracts the convention crowd, as the conference facilities are very nice. I also think that added "resort fees" are ridiculous, in this case, $16.95/day to cover the cost of the fitness center, newspaper, bottled water. I know why hotels do it (to show a lower base price on search engines), but for heavens sake, if the price is not "optional", include it in your base price. This is another reason why I will never stay in a Gaylord if I am spending my own money. The self service parking is a haul to the front lobby. Since I had material for the trade show, I opted to use the valet parking at $20.00/night (plus tax). There is also a charge for self parking. This does seem silly when there is ample space for parking. When I called for my car to be brought up from valet parking, it was done within 10 minutes. I stayed there for two nights for a conference. The front desk was very accommodating providing me with an early checkin at 1:00 p.m. Because of the conference rate, I received a run-of-the house room, which in this case was a two queen bed room in the St. Augustine wing. One thing about check-in - I asked the clerk about the hours of the fitness center. She said that it opened at 6:00 a.m. Because our conference started at 7:30, this meant I would get almost no workout in the morning. I found out the next morning that the fitness center actually opens at 5:00 a.m. The front desk staff really should know this type of information. The clerk said she was "upgrading" me to an atrium view room. Perhaps this is an upgrade because you have the world's smallest balcony overlooking the fake scenery. What you also get is very loud noise at night that reverberates from people talking or laughing in the atrium public spaces. The two queen beds meant that there was no space for a side chair or couch. The only chair available was the desk chair. The room itself was spotlessly clean and nicely decorated otherwise. The desk area was huge and provided plenty of outlets and space for paperwork and computer. The bathroom had a separate area for the double sink and then the commode/shower. I do love the Gaylord moisturizer that they provide. The pool area is, indeed, under construction and they start early (before 8:00). While the noise makes it almost impossible to relax, The pool itself is very large (I don't know where the previous poster got the 45 persons as a bathing load figure, but that is not correct). It was a great place to swim laps in the morning (the pool opens at 7:00). The two jacuzzis had a terrific design I'd never seen before - they were both shaped like barbells, so that even if you were on one side of the jacuzzi, another couple could easily relax on the other side and still have a bit of privacy (as opposed to everyone sitting in a round jacuzzi and staring at each other). The fitness room was very nice and is located in the basement near the great lawn. There were five ellipticals, at least a half dozen bikes, rowing machines, numerous treadmills, and all sorts of weight equipment, all in good condition. There were plenty of towels and sanitizing wipes. I like Life Fitness equipment, and enjoyed using the bikes. I heard one person describe the dining as "paying too much for what you get." I thought at first that might be sour grapes, but that phrase sums it up precisely. I ate dinner one night at the Sports Bar, Wreckers. It is truly an impressive space, taking up two floors with plenty of TVs and large screen TVs. I ordered a mojito, which had probably two ounces total of liquid once all of the ice was dumped in. I understand that resort food is never cheap, but usually it is good food. I ordered a wedge salad, and a $15 cheeseburger with fries. The wedge salad came with absolutely tasteless tomato slices. Either serve food with taste, or leave it off the plate. The cheeseburger (with Havarti) was OK, more rare than the medium I ordered. The french fries were served in cute basket to resemble a deep fryer basket. They were, unfortunately, cool and hard. The absolute best thing I ate at the resort was the ham, cheese, and egg croissant from Java Coast. It was delicious and resonably priced at less than $7.00. Checkout was confusing. I received an itemized statement on my last day, but it did not clearly state whether or not I could just leave without going through the check-out process using the TV, front desk, or kiosks. I decided to play it safe, and use one of the two kiosks. One of the kiosks was broke. The other one worked, but I think you can just leave without using the kiosk if you receive your bill. I don't know. It still was not clear even after using the kiosk. All in all, the staff sure do seem to try very hard. I did not encounter anyone who was not pleasant. As a side note, the fake Mallory Square was a complete disappointment. If you're going to call something Mallory Square, have jugglers and musicians at sunset. The imitation "southernmost point" barrell from Key West just seemed pathetic sitting next to a fake boat in a fake lagoon. I can't really give this hotel a bad rating, as the rooms are clean and the service is good. The landscaping is also very impressive.

<Title>“Great place, BUT construction going on by pool”
<Content>This hotel is really beautiful with incredible disney-like atriums filled with interesting things to see. My only problem was there is construction going on right now around the pool area (they're adding a 'swim park' for kids) so part of the area is blockaded and the noise is deafening at times and other times just annoying. When you are trying to relax by the pool the last thing you want to hear is heavy machinery. They should make a point of letting people know before they book because at $300ish a night this was a big disappointment.

<Title>“just okay”
<Content>We stayed at the Gaylord Palms Resort this past weekend. It is overpriced and "cheap" at the same time. Overpriced: It is remote and makes it very difficult and costly to leave the resort. Round trip to Downtown Disney is $40.00. The resort runs two buses a day to and from so you are forced to take a cab. Cheap: the walls are thin so you hear everything, the bathroom is small, the linens old. Would I stay there again? No thanks.

<Title>“Had a great time but needs improvement!!”
<Content>This resort has amazing facilities!!! the grounds the resort is in are gorgeous!!!! couple of things you should keep in mind... This is a 4 1/2 star hotel, so do not expect anything in here to be a reasonable price!! valet is $22 a day, add a $17 resort fee a day as well, and keep in mind that it is a 300ish a night resort so over all a weekend here will easily be over a grand just in the resort. room service has reasonably good food at a decent price but the extra charges are ridiculous!!! i think its like 25% added for tips and $12 room service fee I don't know it was something like that. The room I stayed in was the Emerald Bay Atrium double queen. The view from the room was great, it is expected to be absolutely neat and clean as it was but i have stayed at other 4 or 5 star hotels that haven't been as clean as this one. My experience is if you can get a room at the top floor get it!! sometimes I could hear the noise of the people downstairs at 2 am and I was at the 6th floor. Some beds need to be changed as they are really creaky lol but they were really comfortable as expected. the restaurants in the resort are good but people this is orlando and you can find better food and nightlife if you leave the resort!! I have two huge problems with this hotel. 1) nothing online warning about the huge construction in the pool and only a small part of it open. I paid a grand to be in a resort that the pool fits only about 45 people and hosts about seven or eight hundred!!! RIDICULOUS!!!!! 2) bar near the pool people!!!!!!!! and closing time 11 really????? come on its spring break!!!! hopefully this will help someone

<Title>“Amazing”
<Content>Wow, where to begin. The beds were definitely the best hotel beds I've ever slept on! My son felt the same way. There is a parking fee and a resort fee daily, so be aware of that when booking this hotel. My only complaint about the resort fee was that included with that is supposed to be 2 bottles of Dasani water daily, and we only got 2 bottles the day we checked in. The pool area is under construction as they are in the process of building a water play area with 3 slides and one of those huge buckets that dumps A TON of water on children. THey have a really big South Beach style pool, long and narrow, and two hot tubs. The grounds of this hotel are absolutely beautiful.

<Title>“Bring your earplugs.”
<Content>Just returned from a 4 night stay the the Gaylord Palms Resort. The grounds were very impressive and immaculate. The room? Well that's another story. When I arrived in the room, I thought it would have been nice if someone had run a dust rag over it. Also, perhaps it would have been nice to erase the previous guests messages from the voice mail. I stayed in room 7320. BRING YOUR EARPLUGS! This room was next to a service elevator which ran all night long. It was quite noisy, and I wound up buying one set of earplugs in the gift shop for what 10 sets would have cost me at any pharmacy. I've never had problems with hotel beds in the past, but this bed was as firm as a slab of concrete. I tossed and turned a lot. I'm certain I will sleep very well (at home) tonight. Overall, the grounds are impressive, the pool was nice and and the workout facility was above average. The food was better than average as well. A good place for business, as the convention facilities were outstanding. However, like any resort in the area, you can't exactly stroll off the grounds and around town. It's cabbing or driving and it's a $50 cab ride to/from the airport. tk

<Content>Stayed here for the Truckload Carriers Association Annual Convention and loved the self contained environment of the setting. The fort in the atrium, alligators, turtles, koi, and ample greenery all contributed to an enjoyable stay. The rooms were good sized and the staff, from front desk to concierge to housekeeping, were all very accommodating and helpful. Much pricier than my normal digs, but it was a nice splurge.

<Content>I'm in the hotel room nice and it is fairly nice aesthetically but it smells! It smells like cleaning products and there are no windows that open so I feel like I'm stuck in a hamster cage (although it has nice decor) I called the front desk and the person was pleasant but said my only option was up upgrade to a room with atrium view for $$. He said he'll also send up a air filter so I'm just waiting. The smelly room that hurts my nose to breathe and parking that costs $16.05 each time we leave the lot is very disappointing. I'm here for a conference for 5 nights and not looking forward to it!

<Title>“Interesting hotel near Disneyworld”
<Content>The very large hotel is circular with a huge atrium in the middle consisting of pathways and waterways through the various "florida-themed" areas. I found it contrived and artificial; but people reacted with "Wow, I love that place!" so to each his own.It was certainly a lot better to look at fish and trees than a parking lot or strip mall as can be the case in other hotels. The food was good, but way over-priced, although Orlando is expensive in general. The worst thing for me was the water - the hotel had that sulfurous Florida water, and served that tap water with dinner. A small bottled water was $3.50 in the restaurant; but good water was included with the buffet. The rack rates are so high, I can't imagine who would pay them. We got a deal so it was worth it. Even though the suite had everything you could ask for, the details were lacking. The air-conditioning blew out in full force right on the 1 chair and couch in front of the TV, while the rest of the suite was fairly warm. Two small bottles of water were provided a day - the tap water is pretty bad. There was a pod coffee maker, but only 1 condiment package per pod so there was not enough creamer for our taste (I don't know why this is a problem in so many hotels). The location is good for driving to DisneyWorld, about 7 minutes. Be certain you use the correct exit, because the roads there are very confusing. The staff in the lobby, registration and restaurants were all very pleasant and professional. Overall it is a very nice hotel and an experience in itself. There was a big convention there and they seemed to be having a good time.

<Content>You sort of have to be rich to stay here - first there's the room charge, then taxes, then a resort fee, and then parking. Yikes. But, once there, we had a great poolside expereince for the day. And the staff was absolutely delightful! Food was good too, but WAYYYYYY overpriced. My advice, bring your own food and beverages - they have a fridge in your room.

<Content>Beautiful hotel - however make sure to account for the additional $30 per night you’ll pay in automatic incidental charges for parking and resort fees. Stay would have been perfect if not for the fact that they do not tell you about these fees until you receive your check out bill. Place is probably still worth the money,close to everything, outstanding food quality (a bit pricey though), clean rooms and freindly staff.

<Title>“Not-So Relaxing Getaway”
<Content>I live within 45 minutes of this resort and have visited several times during the holidays for their ICE exhibit. I have always wanted to stay at the resort and finally booked it for a birthday getaway. We stayed over a Saturday night in the spring when the resort was fairly full with conventioneers. We booked on Hotwire knowing that it was most likely this resort which is what we wanted. When we arrived around 7 p.m. we were greeted nicely by the valet and went to check-in. Check-in was ok, but not overly nice and they were unable to accommodate a king size bed, so they said they would upgrade us to a lobby view. This really didn't matter to us, but the wrong directions to the room the customer service person gave us was fairly annoying. After settling into the room, I visited the sports bar to watch some basketball. This venue was extremely nice and would warrant a return. Our main reason that we booked the hotel was to get a nice night sleep and sleep later than our normal time followed by a nice brunch in the resort. Our issues began the next morning before 9 a.m. when housekeeping decide to knock on our door multiple times to try to service our room. When I finally got up to answer the door, she was nice enough to remind us that check-out was at 11:30. My wife then proceeded to call the front desk to inform them of their star employee and received a not so committed sorry. We were both so frustrated that we promptly got dressed and left the resort without spending another dollar. I don't think I will be back. I originally was going to bring a group here for a meeting, but I will be looking elsewhere.

<Content>Checked in late; dead internet service. OK, that happens, but what was great is that the front desk owned the problem, which finally involved switching rooms (maybe hotels need to include checking internet when they turn rooms?), but they took care of all of it, and followed up to make sure the situation was resolved. Kudos to the desk staff.

<Title>“A city within a city”
<Content>Nice hotel and it should be for the price. Rooms were what I would expect from a large resort hotel. Nice but nothing special. The atrium and restaurant area was ok the first day ot two but then became a bit boring. The restaurants required mostly reservations but that is to be expected. My problem was with how slow room service was and if they are having any conventions or large groups, tjhe public areas are too crowded. I waited one morning in line a the carryout coffee/danish style breakfast shop for 20 minutes. Just for a carry out coffee and Danish. Just a "throw-in", the atrium area is extremely loud as well....voices and such bounced of the glass ceilings and structures so while their effect is to give you the outdoorsy feeling, it does not. In conclusion, I would say this is a great place for corporate meetings but after a day or 2 of a family vacation, the place seems cold and indifferent. Not a bad place, just not a place I would want to have an extended day with the family. Just on a funny note but the truth, but it took me forever to find certain areas in the complex and if I was in a rush, I actually allowed time in case I got lost.

<Title>“The Gaylord Palms Resort is a great place for a weekend getaway!”
<Content>The whole resort is really spectacular. When you are inside its large indoor atrium, you feel as though you have been transported to different parts of Florida The atrium includes themed areas from various parts of Florida such as the Key West, St. Augustine and the Everglades with amazing scenery. There is a large koi fish pond inside a Fort in the Saint Augustine section. One thing that my kids really enjoyed, was seeing the live alligator feeding, which is also in the fort area. The alligators are fed two times each day (make sure you check the lobby for the times). There are also many cute shops that you can visit. http://www.floridavacationplans.com I feel the most spectacular part of the atrium is the Everglades section where you go through tropical plants and old Florida style buildings, including a little shack where the kids can see the baby alligators, poisonous snakes and adorable turtles. This is also where the Old Hickory Steakhouse is located, and just outside the Everglades area you will find a world-class spa.

The have a manditory "resort fee" that cover two bottles of water and internet service - I was upset becuase you do not have the option of saying NO to the fee. So they advertise a rate and then sting you on arrival. There is also $15 per night for parking and really expensive food/water ($28 for sunscreen - Really?).. So don't feel cheated, find another option

<Title>“Typical convention center resort.”
<Content>While the size of this resort and convention center is impression, most other aspects are just average. Rooms are okay, yet show signs of age for having just been renovated. On that note, they apparently just underwent a $50M renovation however you can't even tell. Not sure where they spent the $50M. Service here is mediocre at best. My atrium reservation was lost and I ended up with an exterior (parking lot) view. They were unapologetic and rude about it. Ieven had to ask them to refund the difference between the lesser room and the one I prepaid for. I shouldn't have even had to ask. The on thing I noticed that was new is the new sports bar near the convention center. Other than the massive 2 story tall video screens, this place is a joke. Thousands of people were here for a convention and the service was atrocious. It took sometimes 45-60 minutes to be a drink and sometimes you didn't even get it at all. And again, the staff was unapologetic and rude about it. After 2 hours the restrooms were a disaster area that went unchecked and uncleared for nearly the entire evening. On that note, this is a massive sports bar and the men's room has 1 stall!? There was a constant line for the restroom all night. I literally went back to my room to use the restroom which was on the entire opposite side of the complex and I still got back faster than the ups that were still waiting in line. When we ordered food were immediately told they were OUT of both the entree and appetizers we ordered. How does a restaurant run out of food? All and all, this place is fine. They could really take it up a few notches when it comes to service however.

<Title>“Incredible self-contained property, unbelievable service, close to airport.”
<Content>I had to come to Orlando for a work event at the Gaylord Palms. Having been to the Gaylord National in D.C., I was expecting nothing but a first class experience. Upon arriving to the Gaylord Palms, I was amazed at the size of this hulking property. It is MASSIVE. It's essentially a self-contained city. The Gaylord National in D.C. could easily fit INSIDE the Gaylord Palms in Orlando!! Check In: I arrived about two hours prior to the regularly scheduled check-in time. Fully expecting to have to wait, I walked up to reception, where the lovely Jessica helped me. I explained that I was early and was hoping to be able to check-in. With a smile, Jessica told me that she did have a room for me and would get me checked in. After a few minutes, Jessica told me that she had "upgraded" me to a suite and gave me my key. The room: The room was located on the main level just down the hall to the right of the reception area. When I opened the door...wow. What a massive room. I had a living area with a couch and two chairs, a circular table for dining for four, a small mini kitchen, flat screen mounted on the wall, and a separate desk area for business / laptop work. Then and area with two double doors that led to the bedroom with the king sized bed. The bathroom was huge with a door leading to the bedroom and another door leading to the living area. This room would have been perfect for four people. Not 5 minutes in the room, my phone rings and it's Jessica from the front desk checking in on me to ensure everything is satisfactory...now that is SERVICE! WIFI There is free WIFI in the rooms. I've said it before and I'll say it again. Any hotel that charges for this service should shut its doors and be ashamed of themselves. It should always be the norm that WIFI is included in ANY hotel stay in this day and age. However, WIFI is NOT free down in the conference areas. There is a charge for this and I'm unaware of that charge. Amenities: I should basically just list the things this place doesn't have!! There is a huge pool area, several restaurants, to include a sports pub that I've reviewed separately, steak house, seafood restaurant, replica fort, two separate lagoons, one with alligators, one with indigenous fish from Florida, shops, coffee shops, a Sushi restaurant, complimentary coffee, by the reception area, massive conference facilities, you name it. Conference Area: We used a small conference area that faced out to the pool area. I will say that there is construction going on in the pool area as a massive water park is being built. It was a bit of distraction at first, but after a while, it was just background noise. I imagine the convention facilities are massive, but I didn't not go. Summary: I was very impressed with the Gaylord Palms and would DEFINITELY recommend it to friends, family, and colleagues. It is a self-contained city that definitely caters to the business traveler as well as families with kids. I think they are doing a great job of catering to families where one parent may be attending a conference and the rest of the family comes along and enjoys the property.

<Content>We were here for a conference & had a wonderful experience. We were early at check in & there wasn't a king room available at that time. We decided to wait & check in a little later. We were able to check our bags with the Bellhop which saved us from having to trail them around with us. We were served lunch which was extremely well cooridinated, buffet station style. The food was excellent! All the meals that were provided were well run & stocked. We did not have to eat in any of the restaurants so I can't comment on the food or quality but I'm sure it would be an experience. When we rechecked into our room we were very well pleased. Everything was spotless. Very welcoming atmosphere. Our hair dryer was broken & after calling the desk, it was after hours for housekeeping, it only took about 5 or 10 minutes for a bellman to bring us a new one. I was not thrilled with paying a parking fee or the resort fee but I can see that with the amount of staff it is probably necessary. We did use the wifi which is covered in the resort fee but did not have the time to use the pool or the fitness center. Both looked great though. We would definitely stay here again!

<Title>“Wonderful weekend stay”
<Content>Stayed here for a weekend and was very impressed. Everywhere we went it was spotless. The rooms were clean with a very a modern décor and the balcony view of the atrium is very nice. The atrium landscaping is top notch and very well maintained. The everglades area is the best and if want a room in a quieter area that would be the best spot. We ate at the Wreckers sports bar and Sunset Sams and they were both very good. Overall it was a really nice experience and also very easy by car to Disney, less than 5 minutes. We had friends join us for dinner and the only negative was the $15.00 parking fee they charge.

<Title>“Service not worthy of the price”
<Content>Returned to my room after a very long business day at 8pm and housekeeping had not cleaned the room. When I contacted the front desk I was told the hotel was full and rooms were still being cleaned....at 8pm! No cleaning carts in the hallway so I question that statement. No apology offered and I had to request clean towels. I travel frequently for business and have attended many conventions where the hotel was "full". No excuse, especially when paying $250/night. Gaylord did not earn my repeat business.

<Title>“Absolutely beautiful!”
<Content>We visited the hotel this past weekend, knowing that the Gaylord properties are always special. We were not disappointed after walking in. I had used their spa previously, but not stayed there (spa is lovely). The atriums are remarkable and the resort doesn't ignore a square inch of their property. There are beautiful tropical plants, water features and comfy seating areas around every bend. It reminded me a lot of the nicer Las Vegas hotels, but with a lighter feel. I am still a child at heart, so I was very excited to see the alligators, turtles, snakes and fish, which all looked happy and healthy, with beautiful enclosures. We stayed in the Everglades portion of the resort, which was quiet and inviting. I loved the way that they distinguished the differet regions of Florida within the atriums. The only complaint I have it that their linens are not up to par. The towels were a bit like drying off with a saltine cracker and the pillows were pretty much useless, as they collapsed the second you layed on them. Otherwise, the rooms were beautifully appointed and comfortable, with bright, sunny colors and modern lines. We also had breakfast at Villa de Flora. It is a buffet style restaurant located fairly centrally in the resort. It is open air, with our table overlooking the Key West atrium area and the sailboat. The staff was friendly and the tables were cozy and comfortable. The food was excellent and there was a large spread of food that should be able to accomodate anyone's breakfast cravings. The omelets were delicious and the waffles and french toast tasted home-made or better. They also provide a lot of topping bar type areas, including oatmeal, yogurt and bagels. My mom loved the bagels that she could top with lox and capers and anything else you could want. I can't wait to come back to stay again.

<Title>“Wonderful stay!”
<Content>Terrific service, updated & clean rooms and very friendly staff. They are building a kid pool area with water slides so there was construction noise. However, not enough to disrupt our stay. The pool was beautiful, the wildlife in the atrium was so fun for the kids. The restaurants had great food, however a bit pricey in some instances. They have a number of restaurants to choose from so you can find something for everyone. The resort is very convenient to International drive with lots of restaurants to enjoy. Grocery store within 1/4 of a mile to stock up your room refrigerator. Easy drive to all theme parks also. They do charge $15 per day to park or $22 for valet service. Worth every dime!

<Title>“Not a family friendly hotel!”
<Content>I came to this hotel thinking my eight month old son and I could accompany my husband to a convention he was attending for work. We paid $40 additional dollars to have a balcony, so that I might have some respite when my baby napped. This would never happen as this hotel hosts parties in its main atrium... Not a more appropriate ballroom. I sit here in bed at 8:50pm and listen to music blasting and people screaming ( I am on the 7th floor). I have never heard anything so irritating or inappropriate. To add, the family pool is under renovation and only the adult pool is open at this time. What a complete waste!!

<Title>“Wonderful hotel, delivers what it promises!!!”
<Content>I give true to the facts reviews, unfortunately more and more hotels aren't delivering what they promise for the money, however this is not the case for the Gaylord palms. When my family and I arrived we wre greeted by a wonderful staff ready to take our bags and park our vehicle. The check in: was easy, painless And the girl was friendly!! The rooms: we're absolutely beautiful with a wonderful view and extremely clean and up to date. The resteraunts inside the hotel: we're extremely nice but to pricey for my taste, however they were a one f a kind and beautiful. The shuttle to Disney: let me just say thier shuttle to Disney is the roles Royce of shuttles it is amazing. All in all a+++ from me all the way, finally a hotel that delivers!!

<Title>“Wow!”
<Content>What a wonderful place to stay! There are paths for exploring all around inside. I thought that I had seen everything and then I would find somewhere else to explore. Make sure to take your camera with you. The plants are so well taken care of, and there are lots of exotic orchids and flowers. All of the plants were in perfect condition as well. Where else could you stay and watch someone feed the alligators inside? The water that all of the fish, turtles, and alligators are in is so clear and clean. When I went into the room I noticed that there was no smell in it. I really dislike it when I get a room with a musty or a cleaning smell in it. And the room was immaculate. The bed was very comfortable and I slept very well in it. I had a room facing the road. I could see the Characters in Flight balloon in Downtown Disney going up and down. I liked watching the traffic going by. The road rooms do not have a balcony, which would have been nice, but the windows are nice and large and let a lot of light in. I ate at two of the restaurants--Wreckers for dinner, and Villa de Flora for breakfast. Both had very good food. When I went to Wrecker's I spoke with I believe was the manager and asked if they had vegetarian options. He was very proud of his sports bar and pointed out some very interesting features. He made sure that I got some choices that I would be happy with and checked to see how I liked them. I was so glad that I chose this place to eat. The waitress at Villa de Flora was so nice. There were lots of choices here and the fruit bar was wonderful. There were made-to-order omelets and lots of breakfast choices. All were high quality. This resort is incredible.

<Title>“Not bad”
<Content>Went for 2 nights for boyfriends birthday. Hotel seems to cater to conventions, they had 4 when we were there. One restaurant was closed to guests for one of the conferences due to a private party. Restaurants are all pretty expensive, steakhouse at resort is top notch though. Wanted to try the hotel because we had visited it for the ice show, probably wouldn't stay here again. Nice place to visit for a day or two just to see what it's all about.

<Title>“5 Star Beauty 3 Star service”
<Content>This is the second time I have visited this hotel, although the first time i was there alone, the second time I brought my wife & daughter. My wife fell in love with the decor and unique design of the interior, but what we soon discovered is that is what most people like about it. The limitations as a registered guest with family and needing to always have access to the everyday expectations of a place you have taken up as home for a few days, especially at the $425 a night room rate, was lacking in everything from the restraunts, to the room service, and curtesy of employees. If you only have interest in "WOW this place is beautiful." then this is your place, but I would rather stay in a 3 star hotel and get 5 star service

<Title>“Gorgeous Property”
<Content>We were attending the Money Show in February and opted to stay at this property for convenience. We were blown away. We upgraded to a Jr. Suite as we wanted a bigger room overlooking the Atrium. Our corner suite had two balconies and a huge bathroom. OMG, this hotel is incredible. A temperature controlled tropical oasis atrium with walking paths, shops, restaurants, aligators, koi fish, palm trees and a sail boat. The Old Hickory Steakhouse is a must do. Expensive but so worth it. Gaylord Palms is a hidden gem.

Given wrong room on check in booked atrium view when we arrived at the room was car park view phoned front desk took ages for bell boy to bring new key card for correct room and no apology for long delay and mistake!! Would always pay for a high floor atrium view think low floors would be too noisey and car park view boring! Would visit again and agree with other reviews very good but not perfect!

<Title>“Very good, but not perfect”
<Content>This hotel has a huge atrium, which houses a well maintained jungle of exotic palms, orchids, alligators, and turtles. We were very thankful for this oasis, as it had freezing temperatures the past weekend. The kids had a blast exploring this huge "wilderness" in the middle of the hotel. Unfortunately, there was no pool under the dome. While the "South Beach" pool was heated, it was still too cold to go outside (talk about arctic blast in Florida...). When we arrived (after 9pm), we received a room that smelled strange (maybe smoke). Without any complication, we got another room. However, this one had already been "tested" by another guest. Two towels were on the floor and the display pillows were on the dresser. When I pointed this out to the bellboy (that was delivering the bags) he just said " that it was ok, it was a clean room". Oh well!!! With two tired kids I was not going to change rooms again. Note to Management: after a guest goes into a room and does not stay in it, it should be checked by maintenance, just to make sure everything is still perfect!!! When I mentioned to the front desk, that my water bottles were missing, I got my resort fee of $15 promptly refunded. I have to say, everyone was really courteous, and friendly. The breakfast buffet was excellent. Everything was fresh. They had fresh fruits (strawberries, grapefruit, melons, cantaloupes), an omelet station and the most delicious french toasts! It was delightful to sit outside, under the huge dome. Of course, this did not come cheap. (2 adults, 2 kids~ $70). For me, it was worth it. This hotel is very close to the Disney parks. Overall, I liked the hotel and would stay there again.

<Content>Beautiful location our room was one of the older rooms that was described in an early review, “Florida view”. It had the old dark brown furniture that is showing wear. We had some maintenance issues upon checking into the room that were handled promptly. My wife & daughter accompany me to a conference and they enjoyed the pool & atrium area. Ask for a room away from the construction. We were overlooking one of the pools that is under major construction and the crew were making noise at 7:30am on multiple mornings.

<Title>“Don't be fooled by appearance”
<Content>Stayed four days for World Money Show. They have a captive market. You can't go anywhere off property without a car. $21.00 for parking in the middle of nowhere. Resort fee, the new racket. Unless you want the full overpriced buffet for breakfast, you cannot purchase anything hot, only cold items at snack bar. They do not offer a cold or less than the full eat like a pig buffet. We were assigned a room in the most expensive atrium view Key West tower. For the entire stay the hallwey was below fifty degrees. I called three times and it never was corrected. I wanted a manager to tell me they would not correct it. They would not give me a so called manager. The person who answered the CONSIDER IT DONE BUTTON on the phone,said she would take care of it. We could not sleep well because we were on a low floor and all night long,carts were rolling on the floor , making noise. At two AM , drunks were going by ,speaking the F word,very nice for children. For this I paid $296.00, including tax and resort fee, for a room a little over 325 square feet. And that is a discounted price for the convention. Why did I go and put up wit the same crap as previous years? They are a large convention center and they have convention facilities. This convention outgrew Disney years ago. So if you are going for a vacation avoid this place like the plauge. If you are going to a convention, do like others do and stay elsewhere, rent a car and pay parking. You will come out ahead. There was a thing I enjoyed very well, the ride to the airport. Next year I will avoid this and listen to the speakers on the internet. Robert Zykofsky, Leominster Mass.

<Title>“Great Business Hotel”
<Content>This is a great hotel - period. Its more for the business traveller as it is a bit more expensive, however I see by their website there is often good deals and family packages. I would highly suggest an "Atrium View" as to a "Florida Room", but I think both are okay. The "Atrium View" is an exciting thing, especially if you get a room with a balcony. I have nothing negative to say about this property - it delivers on all fronts. I always look forward to returning every year.

<Content>This is a great place for a meeting--esp if it's on someone else's dime as the food/other amenities are particularly expensive (my "half rack" of ribs at 'Wreckers sports bar" was $14 for 5 appetizer-sized ribs). It's clean, tropical-appearing and best-suited for a convention or medium-to-large business affair. There are plenty of good or excellent restaurants within a few miles of this resort. You could get by without a rental car as a shuttle or taxi to and from the airport/the mouse/SeaWorld/etc are readily available.

<Title>“Fabulous Hotel, Food, and Service”
<Content>I recently spent 4 days at the Gaylord Palms for a business convention and it was an eye-opener. My wife an I have stayed at alot of 5 star hotel before in Hawaii but this rivals them all. The lobby is the most incredible feature of the hotel. It meanders forever through streets, tunnels, vegetation, man-made streams, gator ponds, and even a lake with a sailing vessel in the middle. The entire hotel and lobby is covered by a glass atrium. The room was large with all the comforts of a suite. Check-in and out were the best I have ever experiences anywhere. The hotel staff was courteous and responsive to your every need. The food we experienced was fantastic....even something as simple as the scrambled eggs served at breakfast were the best I've ever eaten! Sunset Sams and Villa de Flora were two restaurants where I had lunch and breakfast in the hotel. The breakfast buffet at Villa de Flora was for lack of a better word...amazing! The Carribean Nachos I has at Sunset Sams for lunch the first day were to die for...and probably would feed 3 people. What a great hotel! Don't miss the opportunity to stay here. The highest rating I can give them is excellent. I would give them a higher mark if possible!!!

<Title>“Expensive but nice”
<Content>Great hotel. You could spend a whole day just exploring the hotel. Rooms were clean and I did not notice any kind of bugs like some other posts suggested. Loved having a balcony. Negatives: they do not supply enough shampoo and conditioner for 4 people. On the second day of our stay the shampoo and conditioner bottles were only refilled half way. If a room sleeps 4 they should provide enough toiletries for 4 people. For the price of the hotel you should not have to worry about rationing the shampoo. Yes I could have called the front desk for more but we were up at 7:00 a.m. to hit the parks and we did not get in until 11:00 at night. Also not a big fan of the parking fees and resort fees. We were not at the hotel long enough to enjoy the amenities. Must people staying at this hotel are spending most of the day at the parks not sitting around the hotel pool. As far as parking, if you have car you have no choice but to pay the $15/day parking fee as there is no off-site parking around. Location is close to Disney but nothing else. No stores or restaurants within walking distance. On site restaurants are expensive. Overall, really enjoyed the hotel but not sure it warrants the price considering I am just sleeping an showering there. If money is no object then I would highly suggest staying at the Gaylord Palms. Tip – If you have a car request a room in the Everglades section as this is the closest building to the parking lot.

<Title>“The good, the bad, & the subjective.”
<Content>THE GOOD: -Across the board, the staff is friendly and helpful. -The food is quite good. -The property is very clean. -Good location -- 2 miles from Downtown Disney; less than a mile from numerous affordable restaurants, Walgreens, a grocery store, etc. THE BAD: -The pool is just a big rectangle. It doesn't feel at all "resorty" to me. -The pool is a long walk from the rooms -- 5 minutes of brisk walking. -A true resort style adult and kiddie pool is under contruction. Unfortunately, however, it's being constructed within spitting distance of the current pool, which makes it unsuitable for relaxation until it's finished. -I flat would not take a toddler to this hotel. The property is huge, there are escalators and stairs everywhere, water all over the place, and a lot of very windy paths in the atrium where small children can quickly become lost. -The food is expensive. $46 for a caesar salad, shrimp cocktail, and coke from room service. $11 for an Italian sub at the Java Cafe. -Mandatory $15 per day resort fee. -Unless you valet, you are going to have a 100 yard walk to the hotel entrance. THE SUBJECTIVE: -The atrium gives some people the feeling of being in a lush resort, while others feel like they are trapped in one of those science fiction biospheres that all humanity is forced to live in when humans have destroyed the planet. -Some find the humidity of the atrium tropical. It gives others the feel of heavy, recycled air. -Some find the atrium interesting. Others, as someone told me yesterday, find it "tacky" and "poorly done." CONCLUSION: The Gaylord is a convention hotel that has made some concessions to attract leisure travelers. IMO, the hotel is a good choice for conventions and likely not the best choice for leisure travelers in this price range.

<Title>“No matter How hard I tried I couldnt express how amazing”
<Content>This is how it happened. We wanted to make a quick trip to Florida while we had some free time. We looked up a trip and up came this AMAZING package that included plane hotel and car rental for an insane price but it was a hotel I never heard of. We took a leap of faith and booked it. When we pulled up to the hotel, correction when we saw the hotel from three exits away because it is so huge , we were cheering in the car. When we pulled up we felt like royalty. The hotel was astonishingly beautiful a 5 star hotel. When the door man came to get our bags we were sold. At check in I followed the advice of a girl I spoke to on the phone and asked for a free upgrade to a suite they happily said sure thing and upgraded us. It was December and off season so it was no big deal for them. When we proceeded to check into our room we nearly passed out. The design of the hotel is a covered dome. Imagine a square covered but a dome. the dome provides shelter to a city Literally a city the hotel has created and when you have an inside room with a balcony you can sit and watch all that goes on on the "city streets" from resturants to shopping to a man made lake with a BOAT in it that you can dine on and has night time kareoke. This is just the most amazing place we have ever stayed. Each section of the Hotel is named and decorated after a famous beach in florida. At the time we were staying there they had "ICE" a really cool christmas show featured in the attatched convention center and there was free shows going on everynight as well. We have since looked up that amazing suite we got and cant afford it unless offered in a package agian. It runs anywhere from $300-$500 a night . But if you can This is an A.M.A.Z.I.N.G place to stay

<Title>“Nice but smelly”
<Content>This really is a nice overall hotel. The main atrium area is very nice and the staff seemed ok, but most did not really seem to be enjoying their jobs. Just a guess but maybe they are a little run down by management? Anyways the only complaint was that I stayed on the first floor and I am NOT exaggerating but the hallway area all the way down to my room smelled like an assisted living facility. The best description would be Pine Sol and dirty diapers. I know that is gross, but I am just stating the facts. If there is one thing that turns me off about a hotel, that would be the cleanliness and/or the smell. I was at this location two years ago and did not have this experience. I really hope that anyone who goes here does not have the same experience, but I think overall you should enjoy the stay. I would have rated above average for this stay had it not been for the smell.

<Title>“Beautiful, Peaceful, and Comfortable”
<Content>This hotel was beautiful, the rooms were comfortable and clean. We had a room with an atrium view and balcony, it was great falling asleep to the sounds of the water at night. We didn't turn the T.V. or radio on once. Hands down best experience especially after a long day in Disney.

<Content>This place is beautiful and spacious. The rooms were spacious, clean and well appointed. It is in close prozimity to Disney and Universal, shuttle service is offered. We preferred to rent a car as it was easier. Overall a pleasant stay. We did not have the opportunity to eat in the hotel as we had reservations within disney and universal parks.

<Title>“Well managed hotel”
<Content>I stayed at the hotel for an overnight business trip. The check-in process was smooth and very efficient. The room was well appointed, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The food and beverage outlets were what I expected and were very satisfactory. Even with the size of the atrium it was not at all noisy. All in all, a very comfortable place to stay. The new Wreckers Sports Bar is going to be a dynamic addition to the hotel.

<Title>“Stunning but expensive food”
<Content>The hotel is wonderful and the rooms are very large and comfortable but I found the halls very cold! Be sure to make dinner reservations for the restaurants or you will need to eat at the buffet, not worth the price unless you like to eat a lot. Sunset Sams is the best food and price. The construction is still going on but the pool was open. The atrium is a wonderful spot to sit and relax, a vacation spot. We didn't go to Disney World so I'm not sure about transportation issues.

<Title>“Wonderful Service, Nice Room, Expensive Food &No Pool”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel a few years ago for a conference and came again with my family a few weeks ago and were impressed overall. Our room was brand new, very sleek and clean and gorgeous. We had a view to the outside this time which was nice. The staff was all extremely helpful, even having our clothing dry cleaned when the coin dryer didn't work (after 2 rounds of coins). Having all my toddlers clothing arrive dry cleaned in our room when we returned was amazing! The restaurants are quite expensive, especially the Italian buffet. It was very good, but we don't eat a lot so our $120 dinner and $70 lunch (2 adult and a 2 year old who was free) there was a little much. It is a very short drive to the strip of chain restaurants though, and there was a fridge so we kept snacks in our room which helped. The pool being closed was very disappointing, as it was really not fully disclosed on the website that there was really NO pool available. The south beach pool was supposedly open, but a big ugly mess. I would probably not have brought my son if I had realized this! Not great for a family friendly hotel over a school holiday.

<Content>Service is exceptional from the valet, check inprocess, restaurants and room service. We found the food to be reasonably priced and really good. Our room smelled of new carpet...but that will fade soon. Plan to spend some time in the hotel;. We booked out little trip full of adventures, but we wish we would have had more time to just enjoy the hotel. It is a vacation all by itself. ENJOY!!!

<Title>“Beautiful attrium but some issues elsewhere”
<Content>I had heard from many friends what a unqiue experience it would be to stay at Gaylord Palms. The attrium is amazing and our room was beautiful. We were happy with all the food we ate in restaraunts. My only complaints have to do with the pool and especially the spa. The website for the hotel shows this huge pool with a waterslide and also advertises an adult pool. None of those pools are open. The big waterslide project is supposed to be done by February 2012. I can assure you it won't be as of 1/22/2012 it was just a big noisy hole in the ground. The only open pool is one the call the "South Beach Pool" which is so far away from the guest rooms its absurd this pool is actually by the convention center and it is overlooked by the construction workers and an asphalt parking lot. The most ironic touch is the odd strip of astro turf they have some of the beach chairs parked on . Nothing south beach about this pool. The Spa totally screwed up our reservations and parked us in a room for 45 minutes and if I hadn't found my way back to the locker room to check the time and then made my way to the front desk to complain we may still be waiting. I was so upset and not relaxed I declined having the services done at all. The room they parked us in they called the "Tea Room" was actually dusty . The spa robes were scratchy and of poor quality mine even had a stain from previous use. I would recomend this hotel for families not a romantic get away and wait to bring the kids until the construction is done.

<Title>“ok, but.....”
<Content>The hotel is very beautiful and I ate at both the cafe as well as the steakhouse and the food was really great in both places. This chain of hotels remind me of being in a Terrarium, which is great, I guess - but a little stuffy for my likes - it really feels like you should be able to breath fresh air and it is really stale and smells a bit odd. The customer service was not that great throughout the hotel. Upon checking into my room i noticed that the hot water faucet did not work on the sink. I called immediately and they told me they would send someone right up. I am now back home and it still has not been done. Extremely inconvenient and not very sanitary to not have hot water in your sink.... Also the housekeeping service left all the trash in a bag on the desk in the room -- funny enough, right where the tip was... Also - they took the shower curtain liner from the shower so the next morning when I realized it I just used the shower curtain itself - which absorbed the water..... anyway I hope to never have to go back here again.

<Title>“Beautiful but definitely under construction!”
<Content>I stayed here a few weeks ago after our Disney World trip. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the St. Augustine Atrium. The room wasn't anything special, it was a clean typical 3 star room, but that isn't what you're paying for. The view from the balcony was something my daughters will always remember. So beautiful. We ate at on the "boat" for dinner, which was overpriced for what it was. I did have a delicious cocktail but the food was so-so. The next day we took our 4 kids to the pool and this is where I became disappointed. The pool, which we had a terrible time finding (we had to actually call the front desk from my cell phone to get directions) was right beside a big construction project. We must have arrived during a "break" because there were at least 10 construction workers just sitting on the scaffolding beside the pool, staring down at all the guests. I have to say I was uncomfortable taking my coverup off and getting in the pool. My opinion is if you're going to have such a large construction project going on, the hotel should make adjustments to room rates while that construction is going on. I look forward to visiting when the projects are done, I'm sure it will be amazing.

<Content>Stayed w my 2 sons for christmas, we had a great stay. The christmas decos, the shows and the Shrek Ice was all perfect. We had a room upgrade and loved our room overlooking the atrium. Fantastic christmas buffet, however we felt a bit rushed since my son is a slow eater. Room was large and very clean. Valet was excellent, extremely helpfull despite way too many cars on check out morning. Will definately be back.

<Title>“Beautiful resort, but plan to walk a lot!”
<Content>Stayed here on a business trip and when I turned in, I chose to Self Park and followed the signs, which took me to the Convention Center part of the resort. I walked at least a mile to the hotel lobby to check in and found out I could have turned the other way and parked closer. This was not clear so when you turn in, turn left and you'll then see the signs. Outside of that, I thought the resort was just fabulous! Alligator feedings, a restaurant on a full size sailboat sitting in water, herb gardens, it was all just amazing and beautiful. You really felt like you were in your own Gaylord world! I stayed in a deluxe suite, which was huge. Large front room and bedroom. It was just me, so it was really too big, but I still loved it. The Villa De Florio Buffet was great! All the fine dining restaurants are pretty pricey, but that's fine dining, right? Definitely recommend this both for families and for couples! Would love to bring my husband back.

<Title>“Beautiful but Expensive”
<Content>Recently we stayed at this hotel for a conference. It is a beautiful hotel with great atmosphere. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. There is a lot of construction going on but it did not interfere with the conference or sleeping. The conference area is beautiful, clean and very spacious. Be ready to walk in this hotel as it is a resort and very spread out. The Acoustics in the ball rooms are very bad so sit up close. The restaurants in the hotel number four. We tried two of the three. The prices are outrageous but you are paying for the surroundings. That didn't bother me that much but the food itself was nothing special. For a 5 star hotel I find it hard to believe you pay $32.50 for a buffet that was average at best. It also said they changed from Italian, to Spanish to Greek each night. Well we went there two nights thinking we would get different food and it was the same other than the desert and soups/pasta. Very disappointing. Unfortunately we had no choice as we had no car and the conference left little or no time to get off property without a hassle on transportation. Would definately work in a taxi next time. The rooms were beautiful and quiet. I would say that this is a good hotel but if you want to be closer to be able to walk to things this is not the hotel for you.

<Title>“I could live here!”
<Content>I love Gaylord Palms so much that when my two daughters and I wanted to go on a vacation last summer we decided to go to Gaylord Palms for a week. We stayed there the whole time!!! It was wonderful. You have to get an Atrium room and sit on your balcony and watch people and relax. Sleep with your balcony door open and hear the waterfall all night. The temperature in the atrium is always 72 degrees so you are always comfortable. I love when it's raining out and it's still beautiful inside. Each section of the hotel has its own theme so you can go to different parts of it and be transported to that place. They just made over the pool areas and added a water park for kids also. I can't wait to see it this year!

<Title>“Great resort and convention centre”
<Content>I spent 5 days at the Gaylord Palms resort for a conference in 2004. I liked being able to stay on the same grounds as the convention centre. The food was great and the grounds were nice. I thought the pirate ship bar in the atrium was pretty cool. Since I was there for work I only spent a few hours one day at the pool and didn't use many of the ammenities. Overall I have no complaints and would recommend staying here

Beautiful atriums with fish, alligators etc. Daily feedings with question and answer periods. Many restaurants and bars located within. Only minutes from Disney. Golf nearby at Celebration with preferred rates when booked through the concierge. Nothing bad to say at all

<Title>“Hidden charges!”
<Content>My husband made our reservations at the Gaylord Palms through Priceline at a room rate of $70.00 plus tax ($86.91 total). While we have no complaints about our room or the hotel, we do object to being charged a resort fee of $16.95 and a self parking fee of $13.50. After parking, we had to walk a very long distance to the hotel late at night. My husband has already complained to Priceline for not warning of these hidden charges! Who every heard of paying to self park!

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel”
<Content>This hotel is huge and has beautiful grounds. Walking through the atrium was amazing. The rooms were fine, but not nearly as spectacular as the grounds themselves. My only disappointment was that the hotel bar closed early. We got back to the hotel from visiting the parks and wanted to get a late night drink. The front desk person told us that one bar would remain open until midnight, but when we got there before midnight they were already shutting down and there were several people sitting at the bar. Seemed odd that they would even close at midnight with a group still there, but to be closing even earlier was unfortunate.

<Title>“Not worth the money”
<Content>Our family stayed at the resort recently and was disappointed. We had the impression that we would be staying in a very nice resort type hotel. Yes it is huge, and pretty impressive to look at and even explore however it was all cosmetics. I hated the room, it was the most basic hotel room that I have ever had the opportunity to stay in. I absolutely loveeeee the hilton chain. When you stay at that chain you feel like you have escaped and are somewhere luxurious. I did not get that feel from this "resort" it was pretty bland. It didn't help that they did not have a microwave in the room. I feel it is ridiculous that the resort charges an additional resort fee when you are already paying for a room. It is not as if we are non guests visiting this hotel and needed a day pass to use the resort facilities. My in laws booked this room without doing any research, they just saw it and fell in love with the appearance of luxury that they picked a dressed up motel. The resort currently does not have a children's swimming pool or play area which is another minus. The kiddie water playground area is currently under construction. The massages wasn't the greatest but will do if you just want to feel a little pampered. To close on a more positive note room service was amazing.....food was delicious and it was delivered quickly.

<Title>“"Kitschy" in Kissimmee”
<Content>This hotel reminds me of a kitschy Courtyard Hotel more than an upscale resort. Our room was very small for the price. We had requested 2 queen-sized beds, and ended up with a king and roll-away cot for our son . . . all crammed into a small room. Cleanliness was acceptable, but we had to request more toiletries, as the bathroom was not restocked the next day. The hotel is not within walking distance to anything, and everything within the resort is really overpriced, in my opinion. Plan on doing a lot of walking as it a HUGE place! On the plus side, we really enjoyed the entertainment . . . but not enough to go back again.

<Title>“ICE review”
<Content>Basically, I am reviewing Gaylord's ICE exhibit. The hotel itself is fabulous and the restaurants at which we have eaten were wonderful but expensive as most resort dining tends to be. This year's ICE exhibit was impressive but unless you are into Shrek movies and are familiar with the characters, it may not be as meaningful. I feel the price ($26-28 plus tax depending on age) is getting out of reach for many families especially since you have to pay an additional $13 plus tax for parking, and with the temperature being 9 degrees in the exhibit you can only stand to be in there for about 45 minutes. We were not impressed with ticket puchasing. We had pre-purchased our tickets on-line yet still had to wait in a long, slow-moving line to pick them up. As long as Gaylord has been offering this exhibit, I would think this part would be a smoother, quicker operation.

<Content>I would have to say the place for Christmas is very nice. It is typical Orlando, they soak you for every dime they can. A resort fee, county tax and parking ($14 per day). We stayed for 2 days, it was awesome for my 3 year old. The decorations and layout is huge. The Shrek Ice was really nice. I could not see paying $25+ and $14 for parking to see Shre Ice.We went to the Gaylord Palms in Nashville a couple of years ago. They have tours of the Atrium for free and free parking. They actually like for people to visit.

The Resort put on a spectacular Buffet Lunch which ran virtually all day(we had a booking for 11.am) and then the spectacular Ice carving Exhibition was what made it!!!! Later into the evening we were immensley still enjoying the Atmosphere of the place and met some lovely people along the way! So Thank You Gaylord Palms for allowing us these fond memories!

<Title>“Gaylord Palms-New Year's Weekend”
<Content>Was there for five days over the New Year weekend. Beautiful, enormous hotel-all decked out for the holidays. Huge atrium with bridges, walkways, shops, eateries and small animal exhibits. Very nice to walk around. There was holiday entertainment throughout the day. Convenient location to Disney, I-4, shopping and restaurants but most definitely need a car-it is possible to walk to shopping but it didn't appear to be pedestrian friendly (not sure about sidewalks/crosswalks, etc). Rooms are spacious and well appointed-had an exterior view room-very quiet. Not surprisingly, the hotel was very busy (may have been at capacity) and the impact that I noticed mostly was at reception-there was generally a line to speak with someone, no matter what the time of day and a very long hold time to speak to someone at the front desk by phone.(you reach a recorded message first, then hold). I find this surprising, as even the most basic hotels answer their front desk number reasonably quickly. As others have noted, the hotel charges a parking and resort fee (includes services I would think many people would not take advantage of, particularly if renting a car) ie shuttle to parks, water in fridge (got fresh water on only two of four nights there), newspaper (because of holiday, paper not delivered and one day was a Sat/Sun edition) WIFI (experienced intermittent difficulty connecting ), local phone calls and fitness center. Steam and sauna is an additional cost. The pool is large but has a small deck/chair area given the sheer size of the facility and the sun will be behind the building if you head over in the late afternoon. There is construction next to the pool area. Towels are provided. Overall, I would recommend a stay, however, I suggest they dispense with the additional fees and charge a rate that includes the amenities they offer. After all, the parking and resort fees are not optional if you have a car to park and add $30+/day to your bill (more if you valet your car). Also, need to staff front desk appropriately for the number of guests expected.

<Title>“great hotel but avoid ALL the restaurants”
<Content>i went to Gaylord Palms for a convention then visited disney parks for few days. their services and products are near top notch. i enjoyed very much of my short stay there. but i avoided all of their restaurants. first their fine dining restaurants were really expensive, and terrible. they offer complimentary shuttle services to all disney parks which were great! no need to rent a car and pay to park at hotel and disney park. saved lots of money riding their shuttle. but one day we had about 45 min before shuttle leaves so we decided to go to pool side restaurant and order a burger which took over 45 min so we missed out shuttle and had to wait another 2 hours. and their so called burger was so horrible. came in a to go plastic container with absolutely no condiments. i wouldn't eat at any of their restaurants.

<Title>“Gaylord Palms has it all! Size, location & amenities!”
<Content>Christmas Snow & Ice package was incredible - from the snow playground and snowball 'ranges' to the millions of gallons of carved Shrek ice it did not disappoint! Character breakfast was exceptional with the characters attentive and the food excellent. The Gaylord Palms is a definite repeat affair.

<Title>“Our Orlando vacation”
<Content>from the second we arrived at te Gaylord it was an amzing experience, from the valet to the front desk, I now understand why they would alway reply to any request "consider it done" The facility is spectacular. The rooms were very clean and the service was very prompt. Once we were there we realized that we could have stayed at the hotel our entire time and not have to visit the parks.

<Title>“Snow at Gayord Palms”
<Content>After spending $90. on 2 kids and 2 adults and $13. parking it was not worth it. Your only allowed to be in the area for an hour and now I know why, the area was so small that kids get bored after 20 min. The snow was so hard that my kids were having a hard time to build anything out of snow or even make a snow angel and snow balls. This is not worth the price at all. I don't plan to return in future snow/ice events.

<Title>“the worst experience I have ever had offensive wild guests”
<Content>We booked a room expecting a luxury and upscale experience for the holidays. instead we had the worst time I have ever had at any hotel. It started out at about 6 pm with a lot of noise in the hallway slamming doors multiple teenagers with no adults . We went to the show and came back at about 9 . Now the noise from the next room was unbelievable loud profanity x rated vile graphic comments on sex acts coming from then next room. When we went by the room next to us and we saw 6-8 teenage boys in the room and at least 2 other rooms filled with teenage boys no adults. We called and complained and at first they said they could not control the noise in the hallway . I then let them know that multiple teenagers were in 1 room being very loud an offensive. They sent security up and all he said was quiet down .As soon as he left the x rated graphic sex comments about sex acts on the wall adjoining our room and loud noise got worse we went down and asked for a room change . We told them how offended we were about the graphic sex act comments and swearing coming from the Next room and how there were rooms of multiple teenagers with no adults. The manger named Mat said they could not change us because they had no rooms and asked us to wait 15 minutes-1 hour to calm the situation down. He actually told us to go back to listen and see if they stopped. Not wanting to hear any more of the pornographic talk we walked around for an hour hoping they would handle the situation. On returning we continued to hear loud noises . The security guard came again just told them to be quiet asked were was the adult but just left again. Within 3 minutes of his leaving 3 boys came screaming down the hallway swearing and banging on the room across from us yelling about being in trouble for pointing a laser at someone. My husband went down to check out and surprise now after an entire night ruined they suddenly had another room for us. At 11pm we were given another room. The next morning we got up and tried to salvage the day only to find out there was no water and they could give no time when they thought the water would be turned on. so no shower no teeth brushing and no coffee . At that point we decided to leave . my husband never even unpacked. As we said to the desk as we left It was the worst experience at a hotel we have ever had. Why when we complained the first time of such offensive noise they did not move us I do not know. I made it very clear how sexually offensive the comments coming through the wall were. From the service to the security policy and then the water break down it was a nightmare. We had 2 days of vacation ruined. they advertise as upscale luxury and it was as if we stayed in the red light district in a cheap motel. It may be a beautiful place but if they did not deal with this situation in any way appropriately. Follow up on this the manager RENEGED ON a PROMISE OF COMPLIMENTARY ROOM AND SAID THE TEENAGERS ARE STILL THERE AND HE HAD TO MOVE OTHER PEOPLE 3 DAYS AFTER WE LEFT. They HAVE BECOME A PLACE FOR TEENAGERS TO RUN WILD AND CARE LITTLE about tHEIR CUSTOMERS. even when the experience borders on sexual harrassment they do not care. Do not go there

<Content>My husband made reservations for new years eve requesting the 8th floor, a saint Augustine room, king bed. He prepaid everything. We got there at 4:00 (arrived at 3:30 and the on property traffic was backed up) and they had given away our room already. We were treated rudely and will not give this overrated motel 6 a second chance again.

<Title>“Gr8 vacation spot but TOO MANY guest fees!!!”
<Content>Stayed @ Gaylord Palms 12/23-29/2011. Upgraded to an exec suite,which was very spacious for two but a little cramped for four guest. Shower leaked excessively, housekeeping shorted us washclothes and towels, hallways were extremely cold. Desk service rep Siva was very friendly and helpful. Main downfall w/ Palms: TOO MANY FEES. I can see charging single night guest parking fees, but multi-night guest should get a waiver. Shows were great on days 1 & 2, but after that ho-hum, gr8 restaurants but a bit pricey,again guest discounts would increase sales, would like to have had the opt of indoor pool since this time of year it can grt a little nippy. Make time to get around in hotel during holiday season ( hotel is open to non-guest for shows and restaurants).Overall we were in awe @ the hotel setting and its glamour.

<Title>“Gaylord Palms with ICE!™ featuring Dreamworks' Shrek the Halls™.”
<Content>We didn't stay at the hotel. I bought tickets for my wife and I to see the Ice sculptures as a Christmas time activity. This was our first time to go and we weren't sure what to expect. One thing I did was join Groupon and I was able to get my tickets for $15.00 ea. almost 50% off. We wore Hats, gloves and a coat. They also provide a parka. When we entered we had to watch a short video and then we entered the 9 degree display. As senior adults shrek didn't mean much to us but we were amazed with all the work that the sculptors put into creating the display. I guess the biggest disappointment was the nativity scene. The displays were not as defined as the shrek characters and it was hard to make out the whole display. I think the whole tour lasted about 15 minutes. The only other thing that disappointed us was paying $12.00 to park for a 15 minute experience. We went and experienced something different but I probably won't go back any time soon.

<Title>“Held Back From Greatness”
<Content>On the surface, Gaylord Palms does everything right: great facility, excellent staff, and good food. On arrival, we were impressed by the hotel's grandeur, particularly the themed atrium. The rooms are nice, with double sink marble vanity, stylish appointments and HDTVs and refrigerators as standard equipment for all the rooms. The staff stands out even more than the hotel. We arrived at 1:30 am, and when the bell cap lead us to our room in the recently renovated third floor, my wife (who is pregnant) was so overpowered by the 'new construction' smell that she nearly became ill. The bell cap found another room for us on the spot. The cracks begin to show when it comes to the food, which is not to say the food was bad, in fact much of it was quite good. The Villa de Flora serves a nice lunch buffet, but at $21 per person, I expected more meat options (fish, chicken and pork were the choices, which was no choice at all for someone who doesn't eat fish or pork). The Old Hickory Steakhouse had wonderful staff, as it should for a restaurant that charges $45 for a steak served a la carte. Skip the steak and go for the $9 artisan mac and cheese, which was absolutely the best mac and cheese I've had in my life. The pricey restaurant offerings wouldn't have been much of an issue if one didn't feel like a captive diner at Gaylord Palms. The hotel resides three miles from Disney, right off a highway, and so there are no restaurants outside of these two locations nearby. In addition to the restaurants, it was hard to escape the feeling that one is constantly being marketed at while at the hotel. I found the nightly robo calls advertising hotel attractions distasteful and intrusive, as well as the shrek and puss in boots advertisements, particular the ones stickered over hotel walkways. Considering many of the hotel patrons are Disney-goers, it'd been nice to come home to a place that didn't feel like it was begging for your dollar. All in all, I do consider our stay at Gaylord Palms a positive experience, on account of the hotel's friendly staff, the themed atrium, and the ease of access to Disney World. If it weren't for the over-commercialization and over-priced dining, I'd have given Gaylord Palms a five out of five.

<Title>“Better than Disney”
<Content>This is the third year staying at the Gaylord Palms at Christmastime. It is always special. My grandaughter says it is better than staying at a Disney Resort Hotel. Keep in mind that this luxury does not come cheap. Even parking is $13 a day. Free entertainment several times each night includes an aerial act and lots of Christmas songs. Kids can make gingerbread men or view alligator feedings. Yes, they have alligators in the atrium waters. Shrek is in attendance at the buffet and in the Convention Center, which is attached, you can slide down ice, see 3 D Puss and Boots as well as experience other fun amusements. They are currently redoing one of their pools which looks to be fantastic. That will open in the spring. So much to do, so little time!

<Title>“This rating is for the ICE experience, not for the hotel.”
<Content>Don't waste your time and money... Overall impression: I was disappointed that most of the ice was dyed, so it didn't really look like ice at all. All but 2 rooms were Shrek themed and brightly colored and really not that interesting. The big downside is that there were no areas where any of the ice could be touched. Only the slides. Not even other stuff in the slide room could be touched or sat on, including decorated benches.... So for kids that wanted to touch the ice, it was a disappointment. And outside of a look at untouchable colored ice statues, all there was to do was 4 identical slides. And for my daughter (6) they weren't much fun. At her weight, she barely went down the slide at all. Most the kids had to self propel themselves down. It was slow for me, but I made it down. All in all, it was a huge disappointment for me. It is basically a not very pretty ice museum. The last room had a beautiful ice sculpture of the nativity scene that I thought was impressive. It was huge and was the only thing made of non-dyed ice, so it was nice to end on that.

<Title>“Dreamworks”
<Content>We stayed for the Dreamworks experience with our daughter. Check in could have run smoother but over all we had a great time. It was expensive, but not compared to similar at Disney. I am glad we got the Dreamworks package as we were allotted more time with the characters and VIP treatment. We greatly enjoyed the live shows, especially since the Christmas music was Christian and not just secular. The hotel atrium is gorgeous and was beautifully decorated. The lights at night were so pretty! Staying in the hotel was convenient, other than the extremely high priced food. We left the hotel for dinner. We had the character breakfast which was a lot of fun and the food was great. This was our family Christmas gift, so a splurge.

<Content>Do not hesitate to check in here if you are after a perfect break. The quality begins with room staff and continues throughout the resort. Nothing was too much trouble anywhere in the hotel - if you could dream it you will find it here.

<Title>“Expectations not really met here at the Gaylord Palms”
<Content>We stayed here for one night in December with our two small children to see the Ice and Snow shows held in the hotel and convention centre and were promised a wonderful hotel experience - but we dont really feel that is what we got, On approaching the Gaylord it is a pretty magnificent sight even for Orlando with it's holiday lights and vast atrium. The first thing you notice is that you have to pay $13 flat fee for parking, which is not unusual in Orlando but pretty steep since you have already paid for a room, We checked in at 2pm in the afternoon and it seems like we checked in with everyone else! The check in line was huge and we waited a good 15 minutes just to check in. The staff were pretty friendly and nice so it was a good experience. Be prepared to pay the resort tax which is about $15 dollars, again this isn't unusual for Orlando but steep when you consider the price of the room. We originally booked a Florida view room, having read reviews of the Atrium view rooms being noisy, but when we got there we were allocated an Atrium view room in Key west. The rooms are very nice, well furnished with two queen beds, a fridge, a good sized bathroom and flatscreen TV. There is also a balcony to sit out on. The beds were good quality and we slept well in them.........eventually. However the downsides in my opinion are the noise - the resort holds shows at holiday times (I dont know if they do at any other times) and the noise in our room was alarming - sleep is not an option with an atrium view room. We had all the doors shut, curtains drawn etc but the noise was still enough to drive you insance at 10.30pm at night. The inside environment of the hotel is nice to walk around, but not really all that special and although they have gators and fish you can see these most places in Orlando. The environment of the hotel did not wow us at all and the shops and resturants were, in my opinion too many. Another problem with this hotel is that is it in the middle of nowhere so if you dont have a car or bus you are forced to eat on site and the prices are unbelievable. We saw many people coming in with Mcdonalds bags and supermarket food presumably to avoid paying the prices. This is a fairly good hotel with nice quality hotel rooms - but the downsides mean we wont be staying here again - for me there are better hotels in Orlando for a far better price.

<Title>“Huge hotel with impressive premisses”
<Content>I have stayed at the Gaylord as part of a big group (a convention of 3.5 thousand people, with half of them staying at the Gaylord). I got a room with a balcony facing the internal covered area, which is huge and impressive, with restaurants and other attractions, like evening shows, wild animals in the artificial lakes etc. Valet parking is quick as the valet parking lot is located right besides the front porch. Even if you do not call upfront from your room to ask for your car, the wait will not be that long. If you call them, it is likely that your car will be ready by the time you reach the front porch. Check-in was a breeze, with very attentive staff (the same staff member who did my check-in called my room to ask if everything was fine). Definitely recommended.

<Content>My wife and I have never stayed in anything so beautiful before. The rooms were beautiful, and the service, over all, was excellent. We took so many pictures and we will be sharing our experiences with all of our friends and family members. In fact, we were doing an all-over-Florida trip and stayed in a different city in another so-called 4 Star Hotel at a famous Florida beach after our stay at Gaylord, and the Gaylord Palms Resort made this other hotel look like a 2-Star hotel. Gaylord Palms made our experience very positive, fun, relaxing, memorable, and we will do it again. Thank you for the great time.

<Title>“Great stay at Gaylor Palms”
<Content>Gaylord does Christmas in a very wonderful way. They have enough staff to handle the amount of guest that visit the hotel every year during christmas. Excelent food at Villa de Flora, Great for Kids with the "Shreak Feast" every morning. Rooms are very clean and they look like new. Very Friendly staff. Great Rock show and performance in the lobby by Luminescence Group every night. Great stay. We all loved the stay at Gaylord Palms, we stronlgly recommend. Recomendations: 1.- No sign of "Do Not Disturb" in the rooms. The maid was knocking all the doors from 9:00 am to 10:00 the day of the departure. 2.- We would love to have a Minibars in the Room. 3.- The Final Invoice with the Room Charges was not detailed as we would like. Separate Taxes from Room Charges. Specify where the 50 dollar credit is applied.

<Content>What a BEAUTIFUL property, especially during the holidays! We were there for the weekend, and took the time to see all of what the hotel has to offer. From ICE, to the rock Christmas show, to all of the decorations...it is just beautiful. The rooms are clean and spacious, and the hotelis very conveniently located. There is a Publix very close by to gelp with the cost of food/drinks if you are going to be there for a few days. Parking is easy, and I think about $12.00 a day to park yourself. Gaylord Palms has so much to offer....for everyone!

<Title>“Neat place”
<Content>Let me start with my one complaint - the mid-afternoon dining options are terribly limited. I just don't understand why a resort this size wouldn't have choices for people might arrive late afternoon. OK - two complaints - dining options are not cheap. That being said, it's a nice resort. I guess something has to pay for the alligators and turtles and the goldfish. Gaylord has done a nice job with the indoor sightseeing. Also, there is a nice-sized outdoor pool and waterslides. I wanted to get a ride over to Universal Studios to see the haunted houses (around 6 p.m.) - this being right before Halloween. Since I didn't reserve in advance (by 2 p.m. - not having arrived until 3 p.m.), it was quite an ordeal getting to know whether transportation could be arranged. It was, in the end, so we were happy. But, the rules seem a little restrictive. The rooms are also nice. I had one overlooking the atrium which is a good view. I don't think the parking lot is as good. Compared to the Gaylord Opryland, this one is much more compact --- but, in a good way --- you didn't feel overwhelmed by the property. Overall, a pleasant place.

<Title>“Gaylord Palms Shrek the halls”
<Content>Where to stay, lets start with making reservations, you must pick times to make reservations for each thing you do, but no where on the web site can you find out how long each attraction takes, not even the movie which is actually about 50 mins but they make you stand in a corrall for 40 mins then another 20 mins while some girls walks around with a microphone pretending to be on the red carpet, then another 20 mins wait to get your picture with puss and boots even if you dont want it and just wanted to see the movie. on the good side the movie was cute and the popcorn and soda was incuded. I tried calling the phone number given and the girl who answered and whos first laungage is not english did not know the lengh of any of the attractions and was of no help in making reservations that was after 15 mins on hold. Ice was the one rememing part of this attraction, although again you must wait in line till they have a group corraled then you must wait in line while everyone trys on a jacket, even if you brought your own. the ice sculptors were neat even if a few at the end were somewhat melted and dripping, and half on the slides are closed leaving only two slides open. one note SKIP SNOW!!!! no where on the web site do they say that this is for small children only. So my husband and i pay $50.00 to walk into a small area with a few inches of snow on the ground, the site says crawl thru ice tunnels, slide down slides, throw snow balls, ect what this is is a very small playground for very small childrenn with 2-3 inches of snow on the ground, unless you have small children this is a big waste of monye. lets see what eles while you are waiting around for you apppointment to go to the next attraction there is ONE coffee shop with four tables, if you walk over to the hotel there is one cafe where you can buy a sandwich and the line is out the door and the wait is 45 min. so while waiting there are dozens of people sitting on the ground, holding jackets and hats, since there are no lockers, no where to sit, and pretty much no where to get a soda, i will not be doing this again ever, oh yes and its $13.00 to park.

<Title>“Totally overrated”
<Content>We went for our Christmas dinner although stayed at a marriot near sea world. The buffet was $55 per head which is totally overpriced for what was on offer. No cutlery at the table and even though we asked for some we ended up having to get it ourselves. It was christmas day and not even a turkey in sight - seemed just like any other day in the restaurant (villa de flora). Very disappointing - the golden corralle is better value in my opinion. Car park full of litter. Went in the arcade and half the machines took your tokens but wouldn't actually play. Queues for the ladies was longer than in the theme parks and they were smelly and untidy. Didn't see one person cleaning any of the areas. Tree was pretty, alligators and fish area a nice touch - but overall far too big to feel anything like a personal touch that we feel in our hotel. Long queues in car park to get out and $14 for car parking is a bit much even though we didn't have to pay as we had a meal reservation but visitors to ICE did!!

<Title>“Almost perfect”
<Content>The Gaylord Plams resort is almost a destination in it's self. The place is huge, with different wings paying homage to various places in Florida such as Key west, St. Augustine and Gatorland. It has an enormous glass dome in it's center with a large replica of the San Marcos fort, a river with live alligators, and a large sail boat restaurant. It also sports a convention center were we visited "ICE" this Christmas (a 15 degree ice sculpture area where they put parkas on you to keep you alive). The Palms also has a movie theater within it. We watched a Christmas performance in the atrium complete with a live rock band and gymnast performance that was good. The rooms were spacious and very clean, very comfortable bed. My wife was able to book this room on a weekday with her educator dicount for only $99 dollars, a bargain. Now the bad. There are little, unmentioned "incidentals" that cost us an extra $50 a day. A $15 per day "resort fee", which was for 2 bottles of water in the room? $21 to park your car per day. And get this, no television! Yes, there is a nice flat screen TV in the room, but all it picks up is pay per view movies @ $16 per pop. Tried calling front desk several times to see why, but nobody answers the phone there.We were unable to watch the news, or any other broadcast television programming. There are several nice restaurants within the Palms, all of which are very expensive. We ended up eating a refrigerated sandwich from a coffee shop that was $10 each, and split a $3 dollar cookie.Lastly the place is nowhere near anything within walking distance. Not even a gas station. Still a very nice place though.

<Title>“Ice...”
<Content>It was ice...there's no doubt about it. Is it worth $15 - $30 a pop to see? That's debatable. You can clearly tell that the artists are amazing at what they do. Just didn't seem like enough for the price and they stick you for a $13 parking charge for the few hours you are in there. Saw the Christmas rock show and that was entertaining, but will most likely skip it next year.

<Title>“The Dreamworks Experience at Gaylord Palms”
<Content>We just came back from staying at Gaylord Palms. We stayed their last December and we thought this ICE! was nice but it was one of those things you only needed do once. Then this summer, the DreamWorks Experience was announced to be the new theme of ICE!. Due to my kids, 5 & 8 yrs. old love of the DreamWorks movies, we hesitantly decided to do it again and booked the two night package. I thought the package was pricey but considering the only full DreamWorks Experience with characters is the cruise (which is a lot more expensive), I booked the package. Surprise, Surprise... it was a totally different experience that the typical ICE! events and I am glad I booked it. We arrived late Sunday night to the beautifully decorated hotel. Check-in went smoothly and we arrived and in our rooms fairly quick. Our rooms was “recently renovated” and boy, what a difference from last year. The room we had last year was dark and slightly depressing. The renovated room we stayed at the last few days was bright and modern. The only complaint about the room is that I found the bed slightly hard. I have a bad back and felt very stiff in the morning. The next day we went to Shrek Feast, a buffet at their Villa De Flora restaurant. Shrek, Fiona and Puss in Boots rotated around the restaurant to take photos and interact with guests. Patrons were given green ogre ears after they have been sworn in as honorary ogres and wait for their server while drinking their green “swamp juice”. The hotel had Santa in the main atrium area to sit with kids and take photos (Parents cannot take photos and you’ll have to buy the photo you want to keep that memory). My kids and I roamed the hotel the entire day doing their polar bear hunt and the Puss in Boots quest for the Magic Beans scavenger hunt. In the afternoon, we moved on to “Holiday Hall” for the meet and greet with the DreamWorks characters… we went around not only once but twice at two times during the day. My 5 year stated his favorite part was meeting the characters and taking photos with all of them (Alex & Julian from Madagascar, Po from Kung Fu Panda, Shrek & Fiona and Puss in Boots). At night was ICE! and the holiday shows in the atrium. (The bad part of this package is that you could only visit ICE! one time and SNOW! was a separate admission price). We were up down and all around this hotel the entire day; my kids were pooped by the end of the night. The next morning, my daughter’s delight, we were woken by a wakeup call from Donkey (from the Shrek movies). The food overall in the hotel is good (the ShrekFeast was very good) but it’s typical pricey resort fare (ex. $15 for burger and fries). If you are willing to leave the resort for food, you have many options one exit away on I-4. The service was good and I think the waiters at the ShrekFeast were in good spirits (especially since they were walking around with ogre ears all morning). The renovated rooms were definately an improvement. I will consider staying here in the summer when their new children's water park is completed. My son was already excited by their artist rendering of the new pool area that was on one of the walls. Was the whole thing pricey – YES! Did my kids love it – YES! So in the end, that was the reason I was there and it was well worth it for that reason. We also got dozens of great photos of the adventures of our stay… memories my kids will have for a long time!

<Title>“Nice Property, terrible service, and way overpriced”
<Content>What a pity. It appears they spent a lot of money when they built this place, as the atrium and all the detail they put into it is pretty amazing. But it is a terrible disappointment because it is run so poorly. First, you pull up to the valet line ($21/night) and we sat in line for 10 minutes. Yes the place is enormous but would Vegas hotels make you wait that long? Then we get to the check in desk. About 30-40 people in line, took about 15 minutes to get upto an agent. They they tell us the elevator is broken near our room and we have to take a different one, not a big deal but not acceptable at this price range. We get to the room, it was very nice. Except housekeeping left bottles of cleaner in the room. Then we noticed it has been 30-40 minutes, and we still don't have the luggage. So we tried to call the front desk. Phone was broken! We call from our cellphones, get put on hold. Finally reach someone, they say the bags will be right up. Bags arrived 1 hour after check in. Then we got a drink at the bar. They overcharged us. While some of these might be small mistakes, add them together, consider the prices, and I would never come back here again. There are much better options in Orlando. Oh, and eggs from room service are $17, plus $3 service charge, plus 21% tip, plus tax if you wanted to know how they pillage their guests.

<Title>“Great Place for a Getaway”
<Content>First visit to the Gaylord Palms-- took teens to see the Ice! and Snow! shows. The hotel is beautiful and the attractions were outstanding, particularly Ice!. Yes, it can be a little pricey, but I think that is the be expected--the Palms is more of an experience than a hotel. Staff was exceedingly friendly, and we appreciated being able to store our luggage and keep our car in valet parking the day after we checked out so that we could see the shows. Grounds/hotel were decorated so beautifully that we spent considerable time just taking in all of the Christmas decor. Ate at the Sunser Sam's restaurant, which was okay--my children enjoyed the nachos made with potato chips and the pulled pork sandwiches. I would definitely stay here again--a great place for a weekend getaway!

<Title>“ICE - Gaylord Palms”
<Content>We went to see ICE - Shrek the Halls at the Gaylord Palms and it was excellent. It is so awesome to see all of this since I have always wanted to go see the Ice show in Harbin. This show will have to do for now. It is so neat to see what can be done. For the best experience I recommend to watch the video explaining how it happened at the beginning of the show and then take your time admiring the show as it isn't that long. Also make sure to bring gloves, a scarf, and a hat. The jackets they provide keep your body warm, but they don't keep your fingers, nose and ears warm. Bring a camera with a full battery and have fun!

<Title>“Hotel/resort is fantastic but ICE has fallen as a worthwile addition”
<Content>The concept and execution of ICE has really fallen while prices continue to climb so unless you're a family with young children desperate to see ice/cold you're better off skipping the event. The hotel and resort grounds are fantastic and worth a night/weekend just to see that. You're not going to leave with much leftover cash since parking/food/room etc all grab what they can, but a great property and worth a visit.

<Title>“Never Again... Way to take a Good thing there Gaylords and completly run it into the ground..”
<Content>This was our 2nd. time visiting Gaylords for the Shrek Ice. Last year my wife and I & our youngest daughter & her friend came over from Daytona and truly enjoyed it & had a great time If I remember correctly I think we paid somewhere around $20.00 for adults & maybe $18.00 for kids (under $80.00) for all of us then of course they sneek in the $13.00 +TAX for parking? But last year they did at least give every person a complimentary coupon for a free hot chocolate afterwards. And the show last year seemed to be a lot bigger & nicer with more characters & sculptures & more variety. And the ICE afterwards last year was SO MUCH nicer than this year, they had games the kids could play and win tickets , they gave away prizes , they had ice slides and just so much more the kids could do and enjoy. This year ICE was extremely small and very boring for adults and kids alike, we heard numerous people talking about both the Shrek the Halls and ICE about wow this is it this year? And not only that we paid $160.00 for 4 of us to go this year plus that sneaky $13.00 + TAX parking fee , and the $20.00 photo. Took us less than 13 minutes to go though Shrek The Halls and we struggled to keep the kids in ICE for 20 minutes they were bored to death, nothing to do. AND NO HOT CHOCOLATE this year. So to sum it up it cost us $193.00 for a 33 minute visit to Gaylord this Christmas and none of us or anyone else were heard talking about there experience thought it was worth it this year. Once again looks like GREED is taking over and ruining something else in Orlando that started out to be such a great thing. Last time for us and many others im sure. Thanks Gaylords but No Thanks

<Title>“Nice place, but could do better”
<Content>I was here for a 3 day professional conference. It really is made for families looking to have a starting point for Disney. Rooms are quite comfortable and there is a good selection of on-site restaurants, Like most Orlando resorts, you need a car but being somewhat further away from Orlando than other properties, it is not an option. Except for Disney, everything is at least a 10-15 min drive.

<Title>“Special event hotel”
<Content>Have been to this hotel a few times for Ice event, but have never stayed in a room. Ice is amazing. Hotel is expensive, but got a good deal on room stays site. On site restaurants expensive, we brought sushi & beer from Publix & dined in our room. Large hotel not hard to get around after you figure out the layout. Only stayed there because of the discounted rate & Ice attraction. Beautiful hotel, lots to see there, but very expensive. If its a special occassion or event splurge, otherwise go for the day & walk around. Staff very friendly & accomodating, rooms clean & large, but nothing special.

<Content>The Shrek the Halls display was very cool (no pun intended). It's quite chilly, but very neat to see all the figures made of ice. The ICE attraction with the snow was very simple. Young children that have never seen snow would appreciate it,but that's about it. Our 9 year old was very bored. Thought the prices were quite expensive. Plus it's $13 to park...ugh!

<Title>“Great place!”
<Content>This was my first time staying at Gaylord Resort. I was there last week for a business summit, so I didn't have much time to experience everything that the place offered but my overall feel of this place was very satisfactory. The hotel ambiance was outstanding. I felt like I was in the middle of a jungle....with the lush greenery, alligators and turtles. The middle of the atrium was filled with an experience on its own. The hotel was very presentable and clean. The room was spacious and had a beautiful décor. I would definitely go there for both business and personal stay.

<Title>“Amazing is an understatement”
<Content>I just returned from Gaylord Palms Resort and amazing is an understatement ! The hotel is gigantic and it is almost impossible to run out of things to do. We stayed the weekend and participated in the Dreamworks experience package. My seven year old had the best time, she said it was better than Disney. The rooms are updated and immaculate. The service is beyond friendly and helpful. The resort is a city unto itself. We dined at all of the restaurants on the premises. The steakhouse is pricey but worth it, the buffet is endless, and there's even a restaurant on a boat in the Key West section of the resort. My only advice is to make all of your dining reservations upon arriving, the restaurants book up quickly and if staying with young children eating at 9 pm isn't always easy. We also did the snow attraction. A few tips: don't bundle up too much it's about 55 degrees inside, you really just need gloves to throw snowballs and a jacket and some boots. The ice attraction on the other hand is freezing!!! Bundle up as much as you can, they provide coats but we brought our own. There's also special character interactions for guests who purchase the Dreamworks package, it's a must if you have kids... The characters are very accessible and hardly any lines. In addition to all that, there are countless shops, eateries, and animal attractions along the way. Alligators, sting rays, etc. And you can finish off your evening with a few holiday themed shows in the center of the hotels giant atrium. We will definitely be back next year!!!

<Title>“Gaylord is nice but be careful”
<Content>Gaylord has some lovely points. The hotel is gorgeous and is it's own attraction. There are live fish, alligators, waterfalls and beautiful restaurants all inside the hotel property. In fact, I went there for a conference and never left the hotel for 5 days. It was more that the conference was 12 hours a day, but the hotel made the rest of the time very nice. A lot of reviews speak about the balcony overlooking the atrium and the front desk staff actually convinced me to upgrade to one of the inner rooms. For a person like me who goes to bed before 10-11 pm this is NOT an advisable upgrade. The Shrek performance goes on until around 10:30 and is so loud that my entire room was vibrating. I had to switch rooms to get to sleep as I had to be up very early for the conference. I really enjoyed the sushi restaurant and had a great but too expensive meal at the steak restaurant. The customer service with the bell captain and the front desk was proficient but not quick and the level of service was only ok. I didn't downgrade the overall rating but have been treated better at a Holiday Inn than at this place. I just felt like a number and I probably was. The hotel is HUGE. Once I moved to an outer room, it was very quiet. However, the bed was not great and the pillows were kind of hard. The reason I gave a high review is the actual hotel is so special as an attraction.

<Title>“ICE! was nice but not worth the price.”
<Content>As part of our weekend in Orlando we decided to go see ICE! We purchased our tickets online for $30 each and then had to pay $12 for parking. The display was nice but it only takes about 10 minutes to walk through and then your done. You spend more time watching the little promo film and putting on the heavy coats then its take to walk through. Then we stay for the show in the main hall which also lasted only about 10 minutes. Nice Christmas songs but not worth the wait.

<Title>“Great Holiday Atmosphere”
<Content>We stayed at the Gaylord before checking into a Disney Resort for Thanksgiving. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the atrium, which is what makes the Gaylord so unique. This hotel is an attraction in itself. The holiday decorations and shows were top notch. We love going to ICE. It's so nice to be in that cold room when we live in Florida! That's our few minutes of winter every year. My husband loved the HDTV in our room. He couldn't believe how great the picture was. And we liked sitting on the balcony people watching. My only complaint is that it's sooo incredibly expensive to do anything there. Even pricier than Disney. The restaurants had decent food, but bad service, and it was way overpriced. We had average cheeseburgers for $15.00 because we didn't feel like driving anywhere late at night. There's nothing else in the immediate area except grass and trees, so you're pretty much stuck paying those prices unless you drive somewhere else. Other than that, we loved it and we'll probably come back again next year so we can see ICE again!

<Title>“Beautiful hotel, especially at Christmastime”
<Content>My family and I make frequent trips to Orlando and we have stayed at the Gaylord Palms several times during different times of the year. We frequently go to Disney World and Gaylord Palms is a very close driving distance to there and also to the Old Town area. The landscaping and rooms are beautiful and immaculate. I can't even describe them, you have to see for yourself. You could spend hours exploring. We only have had one instance where we had less than superior service and they more than made up for it with a suite upgrade, free night vouchers, and special treats sent to our room. I have eaten at all of the restaurants except for the buffet and they were all wonderful (other family members ate at the buffet and raved about it). My favorite dish out of any I have had at the restaurants is the Coconut Curry Crab Bisque from Sora, this is something I must have everytime I stay here. Try it, it is delicious and unique. I have had a manicure in the spa and while it was nice, I would have expected a little bit more for the amount of money. During Christmas, the hotel is decorated beautifully and there are many activities available including free shows. ICE is awesome! You can also see Santa Claus in the ICE area even if you don't actually to go ICE. Gaylord also has frequent Florida resident discounts and a School Staff discount (not just teachers) so check for those for great room rates if you qualify.

<Title>“Beautiful for the holidays”
<Content>My husband and I stayed our arrival night in Orlando here. The hotel is beautifully decorated for the holidays inside and out. There were several different entertainment choices and the ones we attended were great. The food in the buffet was excellent and although we were the last ones to be seated, our hosts were very concernedwthat we got everything we needed and wanted before they removed items from the serving lines. And at no time during those last few minutes before closing were we disturbed by the help trying to clean up around us. I hate to go to a restaurant close to closing because I always feel rushed to get out when there is so much cleaning and rushing around for the employees to go home. We try not to do it, but occassionally we do have be late to eat. The staff was fantasitc about it. We did leave a big tip and we were out by the 10 p.m. close. ICE is magical and the room was a great value with a beautiful courtyard view. It also has a great location for the Disney Parks.

<Title>“Dreamworks Experience”
<Content>My adult daughter and I stayed at the Gaylord Palms for the Dreamworks Experience. What an incredibly perfect weekend vacation. We stayed in a St. Augustine room that overlooks the atrium. My suggestion is to pay the extra money to stay in a room that overlooks the atrium. The view is incredible, expecially during the holiday season when there is a giant tree-lit Christmas tree. I would next time ask to stay in a room that directly overlooks the Christmas Tree. Check the daily schedule for the free holiday shows and the tree lighting ceremony. The Dreamworks experience includes ICE, a character buffet breakfast, a character meet and greet and some other misc. adventures (treasure hunt, ornament, etc...). I upgraded to also include the Panda snow adventure (great for the elementary age children) and the Red Carpet Puss in Boots 3D movie night. Definitely choose the gourmet popcorn as one of your free treats. Over the weekend, we met and were able to take pictures with Shrek, Fiona, Puss in Boots, Panda, many of the characters from Madagaskar, and Gingy (the gingerbread man). This is a very personal meet and greet and worth the money. The only disappointing part of this package is that the parking is not included and to valet is $20 a day or $13 a day to park yourself. Also disappointing is that the driver of the Gaylord Hotel free shuttle told me that to take the shuttle to the Magic Kingdom takes an hour. If you drive yourself it will take you less than 5 minutes. Also, the shuttle doesn't run after hours for Mikey's Merry Christmas Party which is from 7-12PM. Plan to drive yourself if you have tickets to attend the Magic Kingdom Christmas Party.

<Title>“A great place to visit, with or without kids.”
<Content>My wife and I visited the Gaylord Palms for our anniversary, and had a wonderful weekend stay. We were able to take advantage of a Florida Resident rate, and it's probably the nicest room we've stayed in, for that price! Their regular price is slightly high, but for the location, and all it has to offer, is in line with other top quality hotels. (Look for specials though, especially if you live in Florida, check their website). Areas of the hotel are decorated by themes as are the central walk areas in the middle of the hotel. The staff at both the restaurant and hotel are very courteous and helpful with all your needs. The room we had was very large, clean and greatly decorated. The pool area is huge and the surroundings are highly maintained, just what we needed as we spent the day lounging around and enjoying the water and landscaping. There is a separate pool area designed for kids, as the big pool is for either 16 or 18 and older. The central atrium is great with walkways, shops, restaurants, and bars. We ate at the main restaurant which at first, I thought was pricey, almost $30 for the buffet. But, it was the best buffet I've ever had, with more choices than you can imagine, including main courses, desserts, breads, side dishes, etc. You could not have that many entrees to choose from, for $30. You spend that much at some Sunday brunches! Each night is a different countries theme (Spanish, Italian, Greek, etc) and they outdo themselves. We have thought about going over, just to have dinner! Anyway, it is a very nice hotel (up there with a Disney property) and if you catch it during a special pricing, you just won't get much better than that.

<Title>“Save your money and skip "Ice" and Snow"”
<Content>While the Gaylord property is pretty and a nice location for touring the Orlando attractions, save your money and skip Ice and Snow. Our family of 4 shelled out over $120 for the combo tickets and left after only 1 1/2 hours and feeling like cattle being herded through the two attractions, left to wait in holding areas, and then pushed on into the next venue. We had previously visited the Ice portion years ago and had fond memories of the ice carvings and Christmas scenes. This year's theme was Shrek, and instead of the clear ice carvings, each vignette was colored in a manner that the ice ended up looking like wet plastic. Only 2 scenes at the end were uncolored ice. As for the "Snow" portion.....if you have ever walked on a snowy parking lot, you've done Snow. The tent is built on a parking lot, and the heavily touted 60 foot slides are just standard issue playground slides. Attendants in the tent promptly remove anyone who throws snowballs. Next time, I'll use the $120 for gas money and just drive north until we hit real snow!

<Title>“Beautiful but not good service, overpriced!!!”
<Content>We just retuned from a 4 day trip from the Hotel and we did not have the best experience specially after paying about $400 per night for their Dreamswork package. It is a beautiful resort but their service lacks quality. We did not get the type of rooms requested on the reservation (two rooms), we had a blocked view and the little we could see was the construction in the back of the Hotel. All restaurants are extremely expensive and their staff does not provide a very good service. The Ice show was beautiful, but the kung Fu Panda Snow was not worth, they had no snow, only hard ice, hard for the kids to even make snow balls, very slippery. The $15.00 additional charge per day, just abusive. We had to keep calling the service desk because our room had different problems like no bottles of water left which was included in the daily additional charge ($15.00) we never got the newspaper.

<Title>“Luxury at its best ! And very close to Mickey & co.”
<Content>We booked this hotel through expedia but didn't know which hotel it was, we only knew the discription and it sounded great. And it was. When we first arrived we all had to pick up our jaws from the ground because the place looked so huge. And it is HUGE. Took about 10 minutes before we arrived at the lobby but the walk through the Atriums was great. The Kids couldn't believe that there where alligators in there the Hotel. They thought it was great. The (kids) pool was a huge succes and service was great everywhere. Only downside are the prices in giftshops and restaurants. It makes Disneyworld look very cheap. We only had one night but one to remember !

<Title>“Great place to experience”
<Content>My wife and I enjoy this property and stay here when we can get a good deal online. We will be staying for Christmas and look forward to all the decorations they put up. The family cannot get enough of the heated pool. Room is always clean and comfortable as we have stayed here a few times over the last couple of years.

<Title>“Loved it!!”
<Content>My husband and I visited Gaylord Palms during Thanksgiving. We loved the place. We had a lot of fun strolling through the atrium, visiting Everglades Swamp, taking pictures near the southern most point of North america in Key West, having ice cream near the waterfalls. The whole place was decorated with lights and Christmas decorations. They had a show Luminescence which included live bands, singers and aerial acrobats. It was really good. We had breakfast in Villa de Flora (a restaurant on the property) and it was so good. The room was very spacious with comfortable bed. We really enjoyed our stay.

<Title>“An Indoor Winter Wonderland”
<Content>Gaylord Palms felt like was in a biosphere, a place you can live inside without the need to venture outdoors. The behemoth atrium is filled with lush greenery and giant palms, streams, ponds, waterfalls and even a lake. It's gorgeous and around Thanksgiving it is turned into a holiday wonderland: thousands of poinsettias, icicle lights and a mammoth Christmas tree. Special shows with live performers are scheduled throughout the day. My room had a balcony overlooking the atrium- definitely a bonus. The bathroom was extra large with lovely marble, granite and stone accents. The bed and sheets were heavenly.

<Title>“A more magical experience than the crowds at Disney”
<Content>Gaylord Palms has a wonderful Dreamworks experience with lots of activities for families to enjoy together. The hotel is beautiful and peaceful. The atrium came alive in the evening with wonderful music and lights that were the perfect kick off to the holiday season. The Shrekfest was wonderful for children as they got multiple oppurtunites to interact with Shrek, Fiona, Puss, and the town crier. Even the staff seemed to be having fun with their new roles as ogres!

<Title>“Great place for families - conventions”
<Content>Gaylord Palms was a surprisingly nice property. I am not too fond of the Orlando area but when business dictates sometimes there is not choice. The Gaylord Palms was very nice. I think for families it is a top spot. the property has everything families with kids need. - POOLS - dont we all know all the kids care about is Disney World and how big is the pool. They wont be disappointed on either front. Rooms are well appointed - ask for a room that faces inside - most rooms have nice patios that face the inside terrarium with waterfalls and botanical garden area. The rooms are not the largest but suitable for a family with 2 kids. Bedding and extras were nice. Flat screen TVs and basic bathroom should keep the family happy. For those of us on business I would say that inside it is equivalent to a nice Hilton but with better exterior surroundings. Room service was very fast and delivered with a great attitude which helps when you are tired and it is late...right? The only down side is not really of this property but the fact that the airport is a long way away and if you take a cab it will cost you nearly 50.00 to get to the hotel if you don't share a cab...they do not have specific hotel transportation but Mears. Inc is the taxi company. Their vans will take you to the hotel but I am warining you they stop at MANY hotels and it may take you FOREVER to get to YOURS.... :-)

<Title>“A very noisy experience with good meeting rooms”
<Content>I recently stayed at the Gaylord Palms for 5 nights for a conference. While the conference facilities in the convention center were just fine, the hotel/"resort" experience was just weird. The upgraded guest rooms face into the enclosed atrium where I was treated to an extremely loud pop version of Christmas carols for their holiday ice show nightly until 9:30 or 10 and 3-4 times daily on the weekend. Literally this was under my window. Could not even think in that room. The room itself was large and comfortable and clean. The hotel did not seem to realize that there were over 3000 people attending the conference. The waits to get lunch were from 25 minutes in line for a pre-made sandwich to 60 minutes for a sit down lunch. Unfortunately, one is captive at this facility because you cannot walk or get to any other eating establishment without a taxi. In one restaurant, we waited 15 minutes to have drink orders taken, another 20 minutes to get 2 platters of edamame served, and well over another 40 minutes to get sushi to the table - nothing that actually required cooking. The atrium was noisy even when the Christmas show wasn't going on. I really couldn't wait to leave. Maybe it's okay for families who like a constant ruckus. I'd personally take one of the outside, non up-graded rooms even with the construction noise. Not enough outdoor space.

<Title>“Calling this a"Resort" is a stretch”
<Content>I just returned home from 5 days at the Gaylord Palms working a convention. I had planned to stay a few days after working since the photos of the place looked so nice. Very glad I did not do that. This really is not a "resort" - as I define that kind of property. It is better described as a kitschy convention hotel. It is convenient for people staying there for a convention, but it does not feature top amenities I expect from someplace labelled a resort. The indoor atrium concept loses its appeal after two days. My room faced the atrium. The sounds of the waterfalls are pleasant enough, but hearing them 24/7 along with recordings of crickets and birds that play continuously can be hard to tune out. And trust me, you do hear these in your room. Even when you wake up at 1 am or 3 am or 5 am. I just don't understand all the effort to create this atmosphere inside when you are in ORLANDO - where it is warm and sunny for good portions of the day outside. The fake atmosphere was odd. And it was not easy to find doors to go outside to enjoy the real weather. The hotel has a very nice pool area. Very large pool with two offshoot whirlpools. I was annoyed to find that the second pool that was advertised when I booked my room was not open during my stay. Then ongoing construction on the site right now was so widespread that is really disrupted any time at the one open pool. Very bad planning. The room rates for the meeting I attended were over $200 per night. Ridiculous considering that construction was ongoing during the stay and one pool was closed. The fitness room was not special at all - same equipment as most Courtyards. The spa offered nice options, but to use the shower or sauna was a ridiculous fee of $20 - $30. You already pay a $15 per night "resort fee." And then you have to pay to sit in the sauna? In my mind, a place called a resort has a nice fitness room, with shower and sauna facilities, easy access to outdoor spaces, a pleasant pool area, and the ability to walk the grounds outside. The Gaylord Palms did not offer most of these things. I never even saw the golf course. The isolation of the location was also a huge drawback. And they capitalize on that by charging high prices for food. All restaurants are squeezed into this atrium. What resulted for me was a feeling of being in a globe. All the noise just hung in the air. During my stay there was a holiday show that played on stage every night. Anyone with a room on that side of the hotel was subjected to an "Up With People" type performance whether they wanted it or not. Rooms have a tiny balcony with two chairs. I am not sure why - why would you want to be exposed to everyone walking through the atrium and not have the benefit of fressh air. Bed is very comfortable. Room service menu was really limited and unimpressive. Staff was very friendly but that just was not enough to make this property feel like a resort destination.

<Title>“Beautiful but needs refreshing”
<Content>I have visited Gaylord Palms in the past for dinner, but never as an overnight guest. I was always impressed by the beauty of the atrium and decor. It is a convention center, so it is always very busy, a lot of people milling around. My impression of the atrium and its facilities remain the same. The dinner buffet was very good a Flora de Villa, and the price comparable to any hotel dinner buffet. The room is what needs refreshing. My expectations were very high considering the cost, although I know those two don't always relate. I'll begin with what was wonderful in the room: * huge flat screen TV * in room computer use for free (the hotel is technologically advanced, anything you can do through the phone or look in a book, you can do on the computer, i.e. check out, room service, find menus and make reservations for restaurants) * large, nicely done bathroom - marble/tile floor, shower, double vanity with makeup mirror, a real hair dryer instead of a built in weak one. Also, a separate shower/toilet area from the sinks. * Nice style/pattern of decor - pleasing to the eye * Whomever made our bed knew how to make one right, those sheets did not come loose at night (I find that to be a rarity in hotel these days!) What needed improvement: * The wireless phone did not work - the base did, but the actual phone part did not * Bulbs out in the bathroom * The walls are paper-thin, you hear everything. I could hear the person next door closing their draps, just to give you an idea. * The bed was incredibly squeaky - and was worn to where you roll towards the middle (between that and the paper-thin walls not ideal for romantic time) * Our bathroom floor had obviously not been cleaned before our visit * The pillows were mush, worn out and tiny * Housekeeping let the doors slam as they began making over rooms, beginning early in the morning. Guests did it too throughout the night, but it became a consistent BANG by 7am. Did not make for a good night sleep. * There was construction going on outside our window, I believe it was also around 7am when began hearing those noises. * Only 2 jacuzzis on property (at least for now) - with as many people as the hotel holds, it was always a party in them. Never an opprtunity for relaxing or have quiet time. I really value my sleep and for that reason, I will not return to the resort. We went for our anniversary and did not get to relax and enjoy ourselves in the room.

<Title>“Nothing Great”
<Content>Average 3 star hotel. Looks nice but that's it. No amenities in the bathrooms. Food was very good but very expensive. Very, very loud. Between the noise from the atrium, toilets in the next room flushing and people talking in the hallways and the construction stating at 8am it's amazing we were able to feet any rest.

<Title>“Convenient for conference but too noisy for sleep.”
<Content>I spent 3 nights at this hotel during a conference. My room on the top floor facing the atrium was recently renovated, clean and comfortable. It was large and had a mini fridge. The only negatve aspect of the room itself was an extremely weak shower without a way to adjust the shower head. Unfortunately, this is a very noisy hotel. There is constant background noise from the waterfalls and all the sounds of people walking, talking, work being done in the atrium can be heard in the hotel room. In addition, there are holiday shows throughout the day, including evening until about 10:30 pm which are disturbingly loud. The breakfast/sandwich restaurant was good with a variety of items. The Japanese restaurant was just OK. It took me almost 2 hours to order and be served a weekday lunch. The health club was small but there were plenty of machines. The pool looked clean and was open until 11pm. Overall, the only reason I would stay here again would be for the convenience of being right at the convention center. However, I would request a room facing out and on the side away from the convention center.

<Title>“Just a great hotel”
<Content>My wife and I visted there recently, I was there on business and she decided to come along. She loved the adults only pool so she could relax and read. The indoor rain forest atrium is very appealing especially at night. Had an amzing meal at the steak house, one of the top 5 steaks I have ever had paired with a terrific bottle of Freemark Abbey wine (recommended by our server). Just a cool place that we would return to.

<Title>“Clean, nice, renovated - no complaints!”
<Content>Beautiful hotel. Awesome indoor atrium with a Key West Area, St Augustine area, and Everglades area. Live animals inside. There is not much of a personal touch here, but it is a huge hotel not a B&B so I actually liked it. Our room was immaculate, brand new carpet/beds/paint/bathroom fixtures, etc. Could not have asked for more! Just minutes from downtown Disney and a great place to go after a night out. There is not much in the vicinity but if you make a right out of the hotel and a left onto the road where it dead ends there are plenty of restaurants. The only downside is that it costs $13.91 (a night?) to park and there is a $15 "resort fee" which was actually $16.95 when I checked out... not sure what happened there. I knew about the fees ahead of time as they are clearly stated when booking and checking in, so no complaints.

<Title>“Best place to stay ever!”
<Content>My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Gaylord Palms for three nights while on our honeymoon. I had to take the time to write a review about how impressed we were. We had a suite and it was absolutely beautiful. Our room, as well as the rest of the resort, was immaculate. We loved the atrium and especially the alligator habitat. The staff was friendly and accommodating (thanks, Kayra!) and overall, we couldn't have had a better experience. My husband and I can't stop raving about the Gaylord Palms... do not hesitate to stay there. You will not be disappointed.

<Title>“It's Okay but needs some improvement.”
<Content>The Gaylord Palms is a small city in a city. The Front desk was was helpful on our check in and housekeeping based on what I have experienced was great! But, it is so big that I think they have forgotten what the word customer "care" means. There was no personal touch that you can feel among the staff, it is just a warm body in the desk. No AMC channel. No breakfast for the rate that you are paying. Will stay in other hotel in the area next time.

<Title>“Only stay here if you can get a room for under $100”
<Content>You can see by my profile I am not new to reviewing and always provide direct, honest and straightforward reviews....I don't even know where to begin with this Hotel. I booked the Gaylord back in August with the intentions of travelling in November , the reason for booking so early was because we (( my husband , daughter and I ) had to be in Orlando for a wedding , that simply could not be missed . Alright lets get started , I will point form everything . - Check in was relatively simple . - Room was small but adequate , nothing fancy , nothing that would denote 4 1/2 star rating , but it was fine . - The atrium was nice, its basically a whole lot of greenery , tropical plants etc. and they have some turtles, alligators and snakes . Its nice to go for a stroll , because believe me , the hotel is not located near anything and you cannot walk anywhere , so if you suffer from cabin fever this hotel may not be for you. - Restaurants are ok, again nothing to write home about . We ate at the Ville de Flora for dinner , it is their buffet restaurant and I have stayed at 4 star hotels in 3rd world countries that served better food than this . Had lunch poolside one day and that was alright , although it was $54 for 2 Turkey Sandwiches, a rum and diet coke an a glass of Sangria. I knew the food would be expensive but this plae id just downright robbery . The Cafe Java was exceptional . Excellent Lattes, fantastic service and a wide assortment of ALL your breakfast needs and also lunch or snacks. We ate here every morning . - Now as you probably have read , there is a resort fee of $15 per day , which I knew about , but really what are you getting for that $15 ? Nothing . In the year 2011 , almost all hotels now offer free internet , so that didn't make sense , the bottled water the offer you , is 2 bottles , mini bottles of Dasani . DASANI !! and the best part is , we had to call down twice because the water was not replenished as they say it will be daily . They came with the water promptly after I called , but with a hotel that is charging me $275 a night for a really small room and then a $15 resort fee , I don't expect to have to call about the one thing that is complimentary . - The Construction ....ohhh the construction * sigh * , their main pool is indeed closed , but they do not advertise this fact anywhere on their website , nor did Expedia by the way , and the one pool that they do have open has constant construction going on right at the POOL , so there is tons of dust and noise and quite frankly it is so loud I couldn't even concentrate on reading my book, so much for a relaxing day at the pool with a good book . The water is FREEZING , ok wel lmaybe not that bad but certainly not the comfortable temperature that a resort pool should be kept at , and please understand , I am a pool owner , I can swim in pretty cold water , but this was just miserable .In adittion to the construction going on at the Pool , we were woken up every morning to the sounds of hammering and drilling right above our beds. If you have a 15month old as we do , you can imagine how our day started every morning with her being startled out of her sleep -Transportation , ha ! Good Luck ! If you brought your own car , perfect , you will be fine ...well expect for the parking fees they charge ( I over heard many guests grumbling about it ) as for us we took taxis or in the Gaylord's case " we have a selection of Town cars conveniently available for you 24 hours " ...what they dont tell you is what they really mean , you can ask for a Town car , we will pretend to order one for you and if after waiting half an hour and you still haven't given up you can complain and we will then magically conjure one up for you . THIS happened both times we asked for a town car , which apparently is cheaper than taking a taxi . I would have rather taken a taxi within 5minutes and paid an extra $2 then wait for 30 for a Town Car . - Check out ...this is hilarious , we waited in line for 25 minutes ! Who has ever heard of this ? Seriously , the desk is huge but only 2 maybe 3 people were working . - I get the feeling from the staff , that means everyone ( except the servers at the restaurants ) that they are doing you a favour , like a take it or leave it kind of attitude . Now listen , I am not a Princess , I can rough it with the best of them and I am not expecting any [...] kissing but at over $200 a night , smile and pretend that you are happy to have a job in this economy and how great it is that someone is willing to stay at your Hotel and pay a ridiculous amount to do so. Bottom line , the hotel is as it says ...a Convention centre , and I am sure for people who are there on business or conventions , this is a great stay , as it appears to me that is who the best rooms go to and whom they cater to , but if you are going for a vacation or a family getaway to Orlando or a Disney Trip , forget it , stay somewhere else . There are TONS of hotels to choose one , don't stay in one where you are made to feel like you are ' work ' to them. As a side note , the wedding we attended had its reception in the Hilton Lake Buena Vista , THEY treated us 100 times better from the minute we got out of the cab . We took a 10 minute ride into DownTown Disney and enjoyed an incredible meal at Wolfgang Puck ( The dining room ) , we strolled , we shopped and spent hours there . Its a definite must see. There is live performances, lots of free activities for the kids and just allot of all around fun . If you are going to Orlando , you can be ensured of a good time , just don't stay at The Gaylord Palms unless you can get the room for under $100 .

<Content>I attended a four day meeting and spent all but one night in the hotel. Take time to enjoy the health club and spa while you are there. I was lucky enough to take advantage of a 1/2 off personal trainer and it was well worth the money. The bar and restaurants have everything you need as far as variety. The meeting facilities were wonderful. This is a huge hotel but they seem to have it all together!

<Title>“Ridiculous service, inflated pricing, LOUD!”
<Content>We stayed at this resort in Nov. 2010 to attend a conference that was held at the resort. Our group was myself, my husband, and my 2 children, ages 5 and 18 months (at the time). We stayed in an atrium-view room overlooking the fabulous atrium that is the focal point of this resort. Here are my experiences, good and bad: Good: Beautiful hotel, atrium and grounds - my kids loved the little crocodiles and other reptiles they have in the atrium. It was decorated beautifully for the holidays as well. Fun and well thought out kids pool (but unheated, and a little chilly in November - not unexpected, though) Spa - gorgeous, tranquil and rejuvenating, everything one expects from a spa. Bad: Restaurants - we ate at the Key West-themed restaurant and the buffet. Both had merely average food at very inflated prices. I understand that Orlando is a resort town, and this is a (supposedly) high end resort, so I expect to pay higher rates than in my hometown. However, I also expect decent food for my money, and they didn't deliver. PB&J or grilled cheese (only!) on the kids menu? My kids love those things, but not every day! The Buffet was ok - we only ate there for breakfast. Typical breakfast buffet-style food for $21 per person. That would have been me and my 5 year old. Who eats very very little. I asked for a reduced rate for my son, since he only ate a small box of cereal and a carton of milk. Manager refused, so that was the most expensive cereal my kid ever had. Front Desk Service (if you can call it that): Now, it was a large conference, there were a LOT of people staying at the hotel, and they were also running a holiday program with snow and music and the whole 9 yards. I get it. But. I expect friendly service and at least a little eye contact from the person I'm speaking to. Our representative couldn't get me out of there fast enough -- she barely looked at me, and when I asked for directions to our room (as the atrium is confusing to navigate), she simply pointed out the window behind her and said "it's over there - take the elevator". Ooooookay then! Additionally, we called the front desk for various things during our 7 day stay - we were always given some lame excuse for why the room is dirty, why housekeeping still hasn't made up the room by 4 pm, why my room service tray sat outside my room for 2 days (!!), etc. No real response, no genuine concern for guests - all lip service and false concern. Noise level: Man, this place is LOUD! The atrium has several waterfalls throughout, and it is a cavernous greenhouse, essentially. Understandible that we would hear echoes of guests' voices as they walk through, white noise from the waterfalls, etc. The hotel was also running a musical program with holiday carols and music. There was a stage set up with lighting, speakers, amps, etc. The performers were very professional with good voices. But. They rehearsed every night at 9 pm. 9 PM! For at least 2 hours. With amplified music and microphones, and electric guitars and drums. I have been to a lot of concerts in my day -- this was as loud as a rock concert, no question. Even with our balcony doors closed, it was terribly loud. My kids couldn't sleep, it was bad. So, we called the front desk to see if we could get moved to another room, or at least have something done about the noise level -- did it have to be at 11 (spinal tap reference - heh). Nope -- we were told that the performance was not affiliated with the hotel, and therefore they could not speak to the performers or musicians or anyone in charge of the musical performance at all. We were told there were no available rooms to move to - which was believeable, given the high occupancy that was evident as a result of the conference. However, the answer that there was simply nothing they could do was unacceptable - it's THEIR hotel, surely they have some say-so in what goes on there? They couldn't move the rehearsal schedule to 7 or even 8 pm? They couldn't minimize the sound levels at night out of consideration for the guests? The answer was a flat "no", and although I am not usually a "free-stuff grubber" at hotels, I did ask if we could have some sort of compensation for our inconvience. Maybe a comped meal, or a free day of wifi service, or SOMETHING -- nope, nada. Finally, on check out day (which couldn't come fast enough), we asked for assistance with our luggage. Front desk refused, said they were too busy, and that we had to do the self checkout, that they couldn't help us. Seriously? They couldn't even call the valet to have our car brought around. Explanation? Too busy, can't do it. Rude, rude staff. Dirty rooms and poor housekeeping: Our room probably hadn't been vaccuumed in a month. The floor had all kinds of dirt and dust bunnies and the like. There was mildew in the shower - unacceptable at the level of this hotel. There was dust on every surface. We asked for someone to come clean our room (after we checked in at 2pm) and were told that no housekeeping service was avaiilable - they were all "doing rooms". Well, that's what I wanted too - someone to "do" my room! Nope, didn't happen. We also had to ask for someone to come make up the room on 3 consecutive days - again, unacceptable. Overall, this hotel is no better than your average Hilton or Marriott. The exorbitant "resort fee" that everyone pays is outrageous for what one gets (2 bottles of water and a non-existant newspaper every day? Really?). It looks nice, but the service is terrible, staff is rude and not well-trained, and the whole place seems to be understaffed in general. We'll never be back, and we defintely tell everyone we know not to stay here. We did do the guest review that was offered online shortly after our stay - we let them know exactly what we thought. Did we get a response at all? What do you think??

<Title>“One of the biggest hotels I have seen”
<Content>The dimensions of this complex are absolutely amazing, several courtyards with glassroofs mean you can easily get lost just walking around the grounds. I was there with a large business function, and they took care of that well. No complaints regarding the food or drink provided and the support for the organisation of our event. My room was clean and very spacious; there was just one incident in the form of a power cut that lasted for several minutes. Not so convenient when you are in the bathroom at such time. I would suggest this hotel urgently upgrade their gymnasium facilities; this hotel has in the region of 1,400 bedrooms, but only 5 treadmills to use in what I consider a small gym somewhere hidden away in a basement corner of the resort. I liked the restaurant on the indoor lake - on a replica medieval sailing boat !

<Title>“Beautiful hotel, rock hard bed”
<Content>The hotel was beautiful! The room was quite cozy as well but unfortunately the bed was rock hard. We had the very last king room available for our stay otherwise I would have requested another room. The location of the hotel was great and I could find anything else wrong with the hotel but 5 nights on that bed killed my back. They might want to look at the beds Marriott uses, they are much more comfortable.

<Title>“The Wow factor didn't live up to the price”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel on a business trip because it was close to where I needed to during the day. The hotel is beautiful and really does excite the senses with a wonder world feel. The restaurant food is good, but has a chain restaurant vibe. The hotel lobby and common areas are very clean. The rooms were disappointing. My room smelled like stale smoke or laundry, and over a 3 night stay, my room was only cleaned once. I was gone for the majority of the day, all but the waking hour to shower and then go to bed, and the room still was only serviced once. The hotel rooms have a key pad that displays a green and red light outside the room. The green light means the room is free to be cleaned and red light means do not disturb. Each time I left the room, I triggered the light to green and still no service. Also- I valeted my car, and on multiple occasions called from the room at least 10 min before getting to the front door and still had to wait for my car. To make things worse I had to be at meetings at 5 am in the morning, and there was no one calling for cars but me.... and yet I still waited out in the cool morning for my car. On one occasion the valet staff wouldn't leave my car until I tipped him....literally stood over me until I reached for my wallet. I was not happy, and will not return.

<Content>The hotel was beautiful, and the staff was excellent. Our room was great (clean, neat, comfortable bed, free internet) with a view of the atrium. The hotel itself was spectacular, lots to see and do, and plenty of places to eat. The food was somewhat pricey, but on the bright side it was excellent. Close to all attractions.

<Title>“Good Place for Convention; not for the sophisticated traveler”
<Content>This would probably be a good hotel for families who want to go to Disney World, Epcot etc......it is well located for that. On the positive side, the service and great attitude of the staff was world class....on par with a 5-star New York hotel. They did a great job on the convention we were attending in regards to facility, service, food and beverage. They actually answer the phone, 'Consider it Done.' Refreshing in this age of poor service. However, we reserved a room with a King-sized bed---and found out all of the king rooms have no bathtub. An absolute necessity for me. The room was very large, but the mattress was poor quality and the bed had really squeaky springs. I've never been to a hotel that had MORE towels than this room--very nice really. To be fair to the Gaylord Palms, I really did not like Orlando----very Mickey Mouse. I sure families would find this hotel great--shuttle to the Disney attractions.

<Content>Attended a convention there, rooms fine, food average to good, though poolside service quite slow. Found the information kiosk useful for a large property, but the system seemed slow and a bit out of date. The internet access was adequate, but just so. Could use a technology upgrade. Overall, a good convention place.

<Title>“Great Convention but the place could use a good cleaning”
<Content>Attended a great convention. The food wasn't great in the Convention area but it was at the restaurants. The facility as a whole was wonderful. Everything under one roof. The atrium was nice and well taken care of. As I walked to my room, I noticed that the hallway needed a good vacuum. I know that this is something that is done at the end of the day, but it never seemed to happen. There were crumbs and dirt there all week. There was a chair in the hallway that had a obvious stain on it. When I got to my room, I noticed a streak on the wall where someone had spilled a coffee or pop. I left it there to see if it would be cleaned up, it wasn't. I had a nice time at the convention, and I so wanted to rate this place a 4 or 5, but I can't because the little details were missed. I would recommend this property for a convention but for the money, many other hotels can do better.

<Title>“Not as nice as other Gaylords”
<Content>Service in the hotel is far from the Gaylords in Texas, Maryland and Nashville. Very hard to find a staff member who smiles. The Old Hickory Steak house in the hotel was great as was our server there, but the other bars and the other restaurant service was poor and not friendly. Room service was great, definitely try the Chicken Caesar Salad from room service (made with full Romaine hearts) delicious. Internet is slow. The shuttle service to Epcot and Disney is perfect. They picked up and dropped off to the minute as to their written schedule. If you are not a person who arrives on time for a bus you will miss it!! and those who got there on time get to leave on time. GREAT!

<Title>“Very nice resort but nothing within walking distance”
<Content>I stayed at this resort for two nights on a business trip and it was very nice. The room was clean and comfortable, and there were several restaurants, shops and a bar on the property. I only ate at the sandwich shop upon arrival, as all other meals were covered by the business meeting. Catered breakfast and lunch were both good. (We had dinner off site.) I had some issues with my prepaid reservation upon check in, which took about 15 minutes to resolve, and then had issues at check out where they refunded the prepaid reservation to my credit card (which was given for incidentals) and re-charged the company card. Fortunately, it only took about 5 minutes to resolve this. The hotel advertises a free shuttle to Disney World and Downtown Disney, so I thought I'd take advantage of this for transportation to restaurants the evening I arrived. The hotel is not within walking distance of anything, as is common of many hotels in the area. However, on arrival, I learned tht the shuttle operation is very limited and there were no shuttles going to Downtown Disney for the rest of the evening. I could, however, take a taxi for @$18. I opted not to do this just for dinner. I would recommend that if you plan to leave the hotel often, you may want to compare the cost of a rental car versus taxi fares. The hotel has baby alligators and some turtles on the property, as well as koi. There are posted feeding times where you can observe feedings, but I was unable to do this due to our schedule. However, this could be entertaining for families with kids. The hotel itself has a number of sections each with it's own name and color scheme. Many rooms face the interior with balconies on some of the rooms. The ceiling of the center of the hotel is glass so you get the daylight, but without outside air. This could be advantageous during hot or rainy weather. There was also an outdoor pool and kids play area, but I did not spend any time at either of these. One very convenient amenity was the free computer and printer across from the registration area where you could check in online for flights and print boarding passes for free. This helped to save time at the airport.

<Content>The hotel was nice. My husband and I spent 5 nights at the hotel. It was clean, staff were friendly and overall a good experience. Only recommendation for the hotel would be to get rid of the bedspreads. Ewww. The construction is also a bit annoying if you want to relax by the pool. Overall, I would recommend anyone staying in the area to stay at the hotel.

<Content>This is a beautiful hotel with great service. They have transportation to Disney properties. We preferred it over staying on the grounds of Disney because the hotel is so large and there are not a lot of people with kids, even though we had our two teenagers with us, it was perfect for them. The pool is great and the 2 restaurants we ate in (buffet place) and Sora were excellent. Exceptional staff service and the room was beautiful-we had a suite.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel and Service”
<Content>We got lucky with this one! We booked on Hotwire.com and got a rate of $89 per night which was excellent considering the cheapest room on the hotel website for the same night was $199. Checking in was a breeze. The Vaket Parking ($20 per night plus tax) was efficient and our luggage was taken to our room for us. The room looked fine to me but the porter delivering the luggage told us: 'O, you are in an old room. They are remodelling the hotel you should ask for a new room for your second night as these old rooms are ten years old now' I guess the old rooms are for the $89 Hotwire people and the new rooms must be for those who book direct and pay a lot more. I did not see that as unfair at all and our room was comfortable and clean and was huge as well. One little complaint - whoever was in the room before me had set the alarm clock to wake up at 5am and the attendant servicing the room clearly did not reset that. I had an unexpected wake up call the first morning. Eating in the hotel is expensive but I guess it is a 4.5 star property so that is common. Highway 192 with cheap restaurants is only a 2 minute drive away. We had a $21 per person 'all you can eat breakfast' in the hotel the first morning and went out the second morning. The poolside bar serves food too but again it is expensive. $39 for 2 chicken sandwiches, 2 bags of potato chips and 2 cokes! Really enjoyed our stay of 2 nights. The staff were delightful and helpful and nothing was too much trouble.

<Title>“Not up as good as they think”
<Content>We have stayed and enjoyed the Gaylord Texan and the Garlord Opryland. This is not the same. Dirty, dusty room. Under construction with no notification. Not response to front desk calls; put on hold for 20 minutes while the message bragged about their STARS service and "Consider It Done". Food in restaurants just OK. Room furnishings worn. Flithy stained grout. If you are at a convention, with a car, I would find great clean reasonable lodging nearby and enjoy the Palms great fountains and atrium and meeting rooms. I should note that the individual teammates were great: April at the desk, my wonderful housekeeper who I tipped to re-clean my room. Great architecture, too. Could be better with attention to details. Still here, leaving Thursday and glad.

<Title>“Is it a resort or small town?”
<Content>Gaylord Palms makes you feel like you have entered an imaginary tropical paradise with palms and exotic plants, rocks and rivers, alligators and fish, wood walkways and decks, and friendly down to earth service. The facility is enormous with multiple shops, restaurants, spa, fitness center, and huge outdoor pool. In addition to all this, there is a very large convention center that can host thousands surrounded by a host of retail shops. Oddly enough, I never felt crowded while visiting this resort on a business/conference trip. The room quality was outstanding featuring a king bed in a corner triangle shaped room which offered more space than usual. The double marbled vanity sink was nice, but lacked a bit of room. The bathroom featured a nice ceremic tiled shower, but no bathtub. Overall, the facility and room are five star! So... why the four star rating? First, when management was informed that I did not have WiFi in my room, I was told that it would be fixed "immediately." After a 3 day stay, it never was fixed. In fact, I noticed a problem with WiFi throughout the facility using my Ipad. Second, food quality was definitely not 5 star - more like 3 star - average at best. A word of caution if you stay here - do not buy the "generic" peanut snacks in the stores on site. I bought 2 bags and they tasted like they had been processed 4 years ago - almost inedible. One final thought, the previous comments about noise are applicable. Room noise between rooms is a little louder than other high end hotels.

<Content>Good location for a convention but very secluded, can't walk anywhere have to have a car. Restaurants are okay but close early and just one bar open later with no food. Was good for business travel but would not go for a personal trip. I have been to 3 Gaylords now and would probably rate this was as the 3rd out of 3. Has the nice gardens etc. but otherwise not too much going on. Rooms were nice with balcony in our room. We also rented a suite for a customer event and it was very spacious with 2 balconies as well, dinning and living room area with private bathroom.

<Title>“Great facility, but beware the nickel & dime charges”
<Content>I was able to purchase a room via Priceline (name your own price) for $71 ($88 with taxes and fees). The receipt I received from Priceline said the room was "pre-paid" with all taxes and fees. When I arrived at the hotel, they informed me there would be an additional $15 charge for a "resort fee" which was not included in the Priceline charge. I said "no thank you", I won't be using any of the resort features. The desk clerk said that "everyone has to pay it, it's not an option". I got upset at that, because the whole purpose of the "name your own price" option via Priceline is to "pre-pay" for the room. I protested the fee, and the manager said that it was no different than a fee charged for parking. I disagreed, because I reminded him if I didn't have a car, I wouldn't be charged a fee, yet if I don't use any of the resort amenities, I still have no choice but to pay the fee. I told the manager I was upset that he was not accepting my pre-paid rate through Priceline. He said "we are accepting your pre-paid rate". I then said, "okay, does that mean I can go up to my room now with no other fees", and he said "no, we accept your rate plus an additional $15". At that time I decided I would simply stay somewhere else, and I asked them to refund the price of the room (since it was pre-paid) and he said he couldn't do that (since it was pre-paid). I realize it was only $15, but it really felt like a "shake down" for more money. I wish they would simply raise their room rates by $15 and have it fully disclosed rather than this "bait and switch" tactic. In the end, the manager agreed to waive the charge, but it was such a hassel I doubt I will return. I also had an issue with the cleanliness of the room. There was a used bar of soap left in the shower, which made me wonder if the shower had been cleaned at all? My room was also right next to the mechanicals room for the elevator, so I heard that all night. Absent those issues, and thus the reason for a 3 star review vs 1 star, the rest of the hotel is quite nice. It reminds me of a Las Vegas Casino (minus the gambling). There is a large open atrium in the middle of the hotel, and they have 5-6 on-site restuarants. I ordered some fish at one of the on-site restuarants to bring back to the room and it was quite good. The self park lot is a decent walk from the front-desk, and at $13 plus tax per day it is fairly pricey, but at least you have a choice (unlike the resort fee). Most of the employees I encountered in the halls were pleasant and helpful with directions. I don't think I would ever pay $200+ per night to stay at the hotel, but $70-$90 through Priceline seems fair for the overall quality.

<Content>I stayed here for a business event for 6 nights. It's a good facility for a convention. Spacious and comfortable rooms, but I would never consider it for personal travel. Almost a self-contained amusement park, it fits into the Orlando scene. It's the hotel version of EPCOT. Well kept and totally artificial. Restaurants were mediocre. Much better options nearby.

<Title>“Beautiful Resort”
<Content>Upon arrival of our trip, I read and researched others' reviews about Gaylord Palms, so I had a good idea of what to expect. I knew in advance about the parking and resort fees prior to booking and that was not a huge concern since we got a great deal on our two night stay. We thought the resort was beautiful. Our room was nice, but,not amazing. I read several reviews discussing unclean rooms and that was NOT the case in our room. It was maintained nicely and clean upon arrival with plenty of towels. We had a view of construction, but, we did not spend a lot of time in our room so it was not a concern. I read many complaints about the poor accoustics at Gaylord Palms. We stayed in Emerald Bay, not near the Atrium, but, I can agree with some of those comments. I could hear the maids at 6:30 a.m. outside of our room speaking loud and clear as if they were inside our room. The same goes for other guests speaking loudly. I tried to be courteous when in the hallways and kept my voice low. Unfortunately, I can't comment on any of the restaurants inside the Gaylord Palms. I hate to say this, but, I read a few too many comments about them being over-priced and under-delivering so we chose to eat off the property. We did have one drink at a restaurant in the Key West area (forget the name). Some people may feel that the prices of coctails are high here (i felt they were a tad inflated), but, I can say on a positive note that they were plentiful in the alcohol content. We had our own transportation, but, did use the Gaylord's car service to take us to Johnnie's Hideaway on our first evening. It was about 3 miles away (about a 10 minute drive) and I believe the cost was $18.50 (plus tip). Not too bad in our oppinion, but, we got a cab back for much less. Check in and check out was a breeze. I really can't complain about anyting at this hotel. I think it is a really nice experience, especially for families. We would go back to this resort under the right circumstances. Really, we like to go check out other areas of Orlando, so I don't know if this is our type of place for every visit (we live in Florida and get to Orlando about 3-4 times a year), but, I can see most anyone enjoying the atmosphere there.

<Title>“Beautiful property with noisy rooms”
<Content>I will start off by saying that this is a beautiful hotel with an exceptionally friendly staff, however the rooms and hallways are very loud. My husband and I were able to hear EVERYTHING that was going on on the room adjacent to us and the constant hall noise was annoying at night. For the price point of this resort, I have experienced better sound proofing at cheaper hotels for half the price. Also, the safe in my room did not work and the shower leaked every time it was used. Overall, despite the negatives, I had a pleasant stay but I'm not certain that I would stay here again when I return to this area.

<Title>“Resort, close to Disney”
<Content>Got this hotel on a Priceline bid for a good deal but you pay for it with the resort fees and parking. Self parking was $14/day and FAR away from the entrance. We paid to do valet because it was $20/day and we didn't have to hike from the parking lot with all our stuff. The property is huge and is very nice, the atrium with the live gators is neat, but this is not the place to stay for a family vacay. There are several restaurants but almost all are high end. Even the restaurant on site that offers buffets was $35/ person for dinner. We ended up getting a sandwich from the coffee shop inside the hotel. Also, was disappointed because we couldn't use the pool, they had it closed for a convention. They should have more than one pool for a property of this size.

<Title>“Fun visit”
<Content>Stayed for 2 nights with my family. We were visiting the newly opened Legoland for our sons 8th birthday. Got a good rate on Hotwire. Check in was very friendly and was given an Atrium balcony room for no additional charge. Ive read others complain that these rooms tend to be noisey but we didnt experience a problem. Rooms were clean. Kids enjoyed the Atrium. They had Shrek characters at various locations that posed for pictures with the kids on Saturday night. Self parking wasnt an issue once we figured out where our room was. We explored a bit and found the easiest and most convenient parking location for easy access. Would stay here again.

<Title>“Big hotel, big rooms”
<Content>I was here for a conference. I enjoyed my time, but the hotel was the typical big gaylord experience as expected. My room had recently been renovated, I was told I was the first person to stay in the room. It was very nice. I wouldn't stay at this hotel if I was in Orlando for a typical vacation, but for a conference, it was great.

<Title>“Gaylord Palms Resort - Orlando”
<Content>Our room was older, the wallpaper was peeling up along the edges of the bathroom. The decor was a bit odd - dark wood pineapple headboards, dark wood desk and entertainment cupboard, but the nightstand was light-colored. There was one "map" picture and "map" bedskirts, but the desk chair had blue peacocks on the the back. Staff was excellent - I recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Don't stay in a courtyard room”
<Content>The massive size of this hotel and the huge covered "outdoor" mini city that is the courtyard of this hotel are impressive. The walkways are laid out as streets with street names. There are shops, lakes, etc., all among the "city" streets. However, this space has sound problems and sound carries and echoes, which is especially noticable if you have a room facing the courtyard. The room doors are not sound proof and don't seal well...since there is no weatherproofing needed in the enclosed space. Drunken customers decided to scream at each other on two of the four nights we stayed here, one night from 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM. On another night there was some hotel sponsored event with very loud boom box type of sound, which fortunately ended at a reasonable hour but did prevent us from going to bed early as we had planned. This must be a well known issue and it is baffling why the hotel management allows loud customers to be yelling at each other in the middle of the night. The food at the hotel restuarants was very average but way overpriced for average food. We are Ok with high end choices if the quality is equally high end...but this was not the case. On the other hand, we were attending a conference at this property and the food served during the conference was reasonably good...even though we heard from the conference organizer that it was equally expensive and not worth the amount being charged. And, yes, there is self parking, but it is one of the longest hikes for self parking we have ever encountered. We would certainly not recommend this hotel for travellers who are not attending an event at this facility, and if you must stay there, make sure you select a room that faces outside (and doesn't face the construction taking place).

<Content>Just left after 4 nights at the Gaylord. Not worth the money at all. Construction is going on which we were not told about which was very loud while trying to relax on one of our only nice days there and one of thd pools were closed. Daily maid service was inconsistent. Rooms were just average. If your not going for a convention there are much nicer and better valued hotels. Will not stay again

<Title>“Overall , a nice place to stay !!!”
<Content>We just made our second visit to the Gaylord, spending two nights this past weekend. We had an atrium view balcony room in the Everglades section. First , the negatives. I think its ridiculous to have to pay $13.00/day to self park in a resort that charges top $$ for the room. Also, the $15.00/day resort fee should be optional, not a mandatory fee tacked onto your bill. If they're going to charge it regardless,why dont they just include it as part of the room rate. If there is going to be an extra charge for bottled water and internet room access,etc., it should be optional for those that want those extras. Everyone needs to be aware that these two mandatory charges will automatically add an additional $28.00 per nite to your advertised room rates. Having got that off my chest, I love this place !!!! It's big , its beautiful, well kept , amd the staff is wonderful. Everything in our room was clean. Bathroom was double sink vanity w/ toilet and shower in seperate room. Lighting in both very good. Plenty of closet and drawer space. King bed mattress was very firm , but thats how I like it so fine for me. Sitting on balcony looking into atrium a nice touch as much to see and going on to make it interesting. Several posts have complained the food prices are top $$$ , and they're right, but in most cases you're getting good value. Dined at Villa Flor for both breakfast and dinner and felt it was woirth the $$$ in both cases ( 21.50/breakfast , 42.00/dinner.) All the activities and landscaping inside the atrium are a nice diversion and really give you the feel that you could never leave the property and still have an enjoyable time. Many shops scattered about that will cater to just about every need. Again , I think some of the extra charges are unneccesary , but dont let it deter you from enjoying this wonderful property.

<Title>“Beware: This is Not a 4-1/2 Star Hotel”
<Content>We found this hotel on Hotwire who claimed it was a 4-1/2 star property. Even if you stretch it, this place would not be 4 stars. The rooms resemble an old Holiday Inn. Old curtains, old doors and woodworking, dingy vanity and an awful bed. The worse part....I feel that I cannot trust Hotwire's ratings anymore.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel”
<Content>I attended a conference and stayed at the Gaylord for 5 nights. The room was large and very comfortable. It was clean and I liked the ceiling fan. The bathroom had a double vanity. The pool was very nice as was the hot tub. I wish I would have had more time to spend in it. It is alittle to far to walk to grocery store so I would suggest a cab. The hotel has cars that will take you but there is a minimum charge over 10.00 each way. There is a refrigerator in the room but no microwave. Sandwiches from the deli stay good in the fridge and are much cheaper than the restaurants there. Like everyone else says...the food is expensive. I also missed Starbucks. They have a coffee shop but not with the selection of drinks Starbucks has. The atrium was very nice complete with alligators, turtles, koi fish and other fish. Very relaxing yet right down the road from Disney World and close to the airport.

<Title>“Loved the Gaylord Palms”
<Content>We just stayed at the Gaylord Palms. We loved this hotel. It is beautiful, unique and very clean. The staff are very friendly and accommodating, from check-in to check-out. Food was good in the restaurants both sit down and quick serve. Our room was exceptionally clean and beautiful, we stayed in the Emerald Bay Atrium, fell asleep every night to a waterfall right outside our room. Shuttle service to Walt Disney World was great, the drivers are very friendly. Shuttle to Universal was very easy to book, and there is a slight charge for this. We also got to print our return flight boarding passes at the front desk, they have two computers and a printer set up to use free of charge. We had some time on our last day before our flight,so we checked out of our room and the bell service held our bags until we returned from Walt Disney World. Love this hotel chain!

<Title>“Nice but expensive extras”
<Content>I stayed for one week for a conference. The room was clean, the bed was uncomfortable and very firm which surprised me considering lots of other not so pricey hotels have great beds now. The hotel is beautiful and I didn't feel like I had to walk a mile to get to the conference area. My biggest disappointment is that the prices are too high. They charge a self parking fee which I think is ridiculous and I have never stayed at a hotel that charged to self park my car. A resort fee was charged daily basically for 2 bottles of water each day. The restaurants are very expensive and considering there are no other restaurants in walking distance, they really have you trapped into paying the high food prices. I ate at the fish restaurant and was disappointed with the food and atmosphere. I enjoyed the Vila de Flora buffet and the food was very good but I think $32 per person was too high. This hotel is very close to Disney but I didn't think the shuttle buses offered transportation often enough throughout the day. I did feel that the service was very good. Staff smiled and were courteous. I would not stay at this hotel on my own unless I had to attend another conference.

<Title>“So amazing kids voted to stay at hotel instead of theme park!”
<Content>Hotel was amazing! Rooms are nice and clean . Kids loved the alligators, snakes and all of the everglades area. Castillo De San Marco beautiful and fun for all. Enjoyed shops , Pool area , Slides, bakery and most of all breakfast and dinner buffet! Our server, he made everyone feel so special each morning . The food was very good. My daughters Birthday, special deserts,good food and the staff was excellent. Spa was reasonable with their specials and massages were superb. The kids actually requested we do theme park another time and we stayed extra day at Hotel. The only down side was the food and service at the Keys boat for lunch. Pricey, the food was fine but that server was not very nice and we were one of the only ones their. Everyone else was so lovely and accommodating at the hotel . The Atrium was where we stayed and the balcony was a nice touch for coffee in the morning. Can't wait to return as a school board employee we even had a special discount. Recommended to my brother and his family and they are going in November.

<Title>“beautiful atrium,large rooms, terrible beds”
<Content>Second time staying here, paid over 200 dollars per night off season. Very friendly staff, beautiful grounds and amenities however, the King bed in our room was one of the worst beds I have ever slept on and that includes plenty of Motel 6 level motels on road trips. It felt like a pile of cardboard making for an on and off sleep. The staff brought up a "mattress cover" which did little to nothing and we did not feel like switching rooms after 10 hours at Epcot. Also, mold on the shower tile and grout was disgusting and although cleaned after a word with the desk was not completely removed. I seem to remember poor mattress quality last visit here as well. Completely unacceptable in a resort charging this kind of money. If you value a good nights sleep over multiple pools and koi ponds and alligator exhibits, I strongly recommend you look elsewhere as the choices in the area are limitless.

Personalized postcards from staff members underneath your door etc. I asked someone at the pool about where to get a specific alcohol, she directed me to Sunset Sams then saw me FIVE days later and asked me if I made it there and how I liked it. Thousands of people...how DID she remember. The property is impeccable, and incredibly beautiful. Easy to get to conference center and find restaurants & other amenities. Great great experience.

<Title>“Amazing Getaway”
<Content>I booked this hotel at the last minute with a special internet rate. After reading the reviews, I was nervous. It seemed that many people didn't have great things to say. Normally, we stay at a Disney "Deluxe" resort and this was our first venture off property. I have to say, We were amazed!! the manager Armeter and the girls in the front desk staff on Sept 23rd and 24th were AMAZING! I did upgrade to a atrium view because my daughter was so thrilled. We were given a newly renovated room on the 9th floor (9073) very close to the elevator above the front desk. The room was spotless and the linens were crisp and clean. We didn't eat in the hotel because we spent most of the time at Disney as Passholders. I also didn't use the bus service but it appears they run often. The kids pool is under construction so the South Beach pool is open for the entire resort. There was plenty of room and it was very large. We came back from the parks early one day to enjoy the swim. Really can't say enough about this resort..I read people complain about the food $$$$ but, being accustomed to Disney food prices for lesser quality food, I am very use to a $45 breakfast meal and $13 salad Room was very quiet..there was a party in the suite next door.Could hear it in the hallway but once I shut my door, never heard another peep!

There was no housekeeping. The prices are way to high, the place is over rated. They answer the phone an say "consider it done" but its not done. This place was a waste of money,and over rated.

<Title>“A business trip that was a real pleasure!”
<Content>Attended a 3 day conference this past week and was thrilled to experience the Gaylord Palms for the first time. From start to finish - sheer delight. Went expecting the usual crowded, beige business conference where room service is the highlight. There were over 1200 people at our conference and noticed that there were others going on - yet never once had to wait in line or felt crowded. Hotel/Conference center did amazing job of feeding all of us breakfast and lunch. Was blown away by the overall beauty and services of this hotel. LOVED the atrium complex design. Even though we never went outside, we dined under the stars and strolled along the shops while listening to running water and surrounded by greenery! We even found time to enjoy the spa! Very impressed. Services and therapists were top notch. The room was magnificent. Stayed in the newly renovated Key West area. Not a speck of dust and the bed was amazing! No details were overlooked. I do need to comment on the price of the food/restaurants - VERY pricey and value was just ok. The salad at the Key West restaurant was WAY overpriced at $17 and was not very well presented. That was the only disappointment. Truly enjoyed our stay. Only problem: it went too fast!

<Title>“Awesome Place!”
<Content>We were there on business to evaluate for an upcoming conference. This place is pretty amazing. The rooms are big; beds are so comfortable; computers in the room for local and hotel use; several restaurants; staff was great too; you can even go to a feeding of the alligators. We liked the place so much, we chose it for our conference next year. The only complaint I had was about the computers they have in the lobby for printing your boarding passes. We happened to be there the week the hurricane was threatening the east coast. While I was entering all my data (name, credit card info, etc) there were several people standing behind me waiting to do the same. The monitors are very large and there was no way to prevent the people standing behind you from seeing your information. I went to the service desk and told them they should consider screen protectors on those monitors. We'll see if they did anything about when we go back next year.

<Content>Great hotel to attend convention. Restaurant prices way too expensive. Hotel too fair from other places to eat if you didn't have a car, $30 taxi fee to go off campus. Food was great related to conference. Need a comfortable chair to sit in to watch tv instead of having to sit on the bed all the time. Only had Airondack style chair at desk and one other chair the same in room. Too uncomfortable to sit in for pleasure. Nice touch to have computer in room to use. $15 a day resort fee for "Free" internet and "Free" 2 botles of water replaced daily doesn't add up to free in my book. Fortunately the resort fee was waived for our convention. Rooms were very quiet, could not hear bathrooms or tv's from other rooms. Great convention facility.

They have some new shops that were fun and, as always, the food is terriffic. This is not an inexpensive resort, but it is well worth the price. Their service cannot be beat, everyone just wants you to be happy and have a good time.

<Content>The Gaylord was much larger than I expected. In addition to being located near many restaurants and shops, there is plenty to do within the actual resort. The interior of this resort is huge to say the least and includes a large glass-dome atrium featuring garden...even a ship. The restaurants inside the resort tend to be pricey, but not to worry, other more reasonably prices restaurant options are just minutes away.

<Content>We enjoyed the Gaylord Palms Resort. My husband and I love to rate hotels. We are big renovators and we appreciate the accommodations. The restaurants could improve on their menus, incorporating more fresh and cooked green vegetables, too many carbs and starches! We look for flat scrren tv's, free computer access,large bathroom with double granite counters, fridges, balconies, terraces, toiletries, and coffee provided in the rooms. Which your resort had all of the above! Loved, loved it.

<Title>“Couldn't ask for a better place to stay!”
<Content>Arrived and had a very smooth and efficient checkin. The room was very clean and inviting. Staff I encountered was very helpful. The Gaylord has a great and very relaxing atmosphere. My family and I had the breakfast buffet at the Villa de Flora restaurant. it was slightly pricey but it was worth every penny and of course it's the Gaylord. We were there for the Tom Joiner Family Reunion Event. Even if we never return for the family reunion, I will return to the Gaylord because it is class all the way. It was an enjoyable experience.

<Title>“Awesome Hotel Can't Wait To Return!!!!!”
<Content>My family and I LOVED Gaylord Palms! Although the pool was under construction my children loved the inflatables the hotel brought in. The Dive Inn, poolside movie, was wonderful. The hotel's gameroom was just right for my children. The hotel was a wonderful place for my children to explore. I loved the room very roomy for the 4 of us. GREAT PLACE

<Content>We attended a business convention here and stayed at the Gaylord Palms resort. We ate at several restaurants in the resort and enjoyed all of the food. Everywhere we ate, we had a large selection of entrees.and beleived we received top notch service by the wait staff. Our room at the resort was a mini suite with two large rooms, two TV's and a sitting area. Our room had a balcony that overlooked the solarium of resort and we had two chairs on the balcony. I rate the room, service and accomodations a 5 start resort..

<Title>“Can't wait to return on a non-business trip.”
<Content>This was my first visit to the Gaylord Palms/Orlando, but it won't be my last. I was there for a conference which left minimal time available to investigate all the restaurants, shops, and other amenities on the property. The one opportunity I had to explore the winding paths, I passed live alligators, a ship, a fort, waterfalls, and an open-feeling courtyard, all surrounded with exquisite tropical landscaping, and all indoors. I didn't even make it outside to what looked to be a lovely and spacious pool area with plenty of lounger seating. My room was clean and comfortable and the connected convention center was a perfect venue for our conference. I paid well below market rate by booking the room through my airline's website.

<Content>I have stayed here 3 times and I never wanted to leave each time. I have stayed at the Key West, St. Augustine, and Everglades areas of the hotel. My favorite was the Everglades because its relaxing and quiet. This hotel has lots of things for kids, from mini golf to a octopus themed pool. Its also just fun to look around and explore the place. If you are looking for a fun place to relax and hang out! Each step is an adventure! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a fun trip to Orlando! The moment you walk in, you will be amazed!!!!

<Title>“Waste of Money”
<Content>We have stayed at the Gaylord Palms in Tennessee a couple times which made our stay here disappointing. The atrium is beautiful but that's all they have to offer. Rooms are spacious but not well laid out. Hallways dark and smelly. Food choices were horrible (can you believe stale out of package rye bread and pressed turkey at the Italian restaurant?) Where were all those artisnal breads they used as displays? All food options are overpriced and food quality is poor. You'd be much better off on the 192 strip for food. The parking charges were annoying since you had no other choice and charging for handicap parking is just WRONG (I cannot think of any other hotel that does that). There is nothing to do at the hotel but sit in the atirum which gets old after a couple hours. You can do much, much better at many of the other wonderful, spacious and inexpensive hotels in the Kissimme area. Do not waste you money here.

<Title>“Absolute worst hotel in Orlando in so many ways”
<Content>I don't see why anybody who isn't at a conference would stay here. The few pros are: Atrium Large rooms Pretty good service The cons are: Compared to the rest of the hotels in Orlando, it's pretty expensive (you can get a better room at the Disney resorts for the same money, and I thought those were overpriced) One of the only places in the city that charges for parking Resort fee No breakfast included Overpriced restaurants (a small piece of fish with some asparagus and 1 martini was $58) Location (surrounded by empty fields and other hotels. the nearest strip mall is over half a kilometer away down a road with no sidewalk).

<Title>“Great Location, Decent Resort”
<Content>I stayed with a large family group as part of a larger organized tour attending Bon Jovi's Orlando concert and this was the hotel that came with the package. This is definitely a mega-resort in terms of size of complex and number of rooms. The rooms are slightly above average, and a bit on the smallish side. The good news is that the bathrooms have double sinks, a plus with multiple people in the room. The upsides of this resort: - Very near entrance gates to the various Disney parks - Large enough to be self-contained, offering multiple dining options (food is not cheap here!) - Very nice, friendly staff and very good service - Beautiful covered atrium gives the feel of being outdoors but in a climate controlled environment (I cannot imagine the carbon footprint of this complex however) - Reasonably family friendly The downsides: - Very much a convention complex. Gets fairly crowded - Really huge! If you're not very mobile, it could be a challenge - Restaurants are expensive, although not crazy given the resort status of this hotel. Food is slightly above average, especially compared to price Overall, this is a large impressive complex with decent rooms. The best features are the friendly staff, proximity to theme parks and amenities of the atrium. While I have not stayed at the Disney and Universal resorts in the area, I suspect they are much more impressive.

<Content>the Gaylord Palms is a wonderful hotel for families to stay while visiting Orlondo, or even when planning to vist Disney World, Sea world or Universal studio. this is also a great place for couples to go to and relax without having to leave the Resort. The resturant are a great place to dine out or have the food delivered to your rooms. The pool is very relaxing and the water temperature is awesome. The indoor atrium is also great for relaxing and even viewing from your room balcony. I definately recommend visiting the Gaylord Palms. This is an AWESOME Resort

<Title>“Great Location, Nice Property, Bring your own food.. Very expensive to eat there.”
<Content>Gaylord Palms was a nice place to stay. We enjoyed the fact that is so close to Disney plus it was close to I drive where you can find Universal,Sea World, Discovery Cove, Old Town, and Aquatica. You really cannot beat it's location. They are in the process of remodeling so no kids pool, but they do have an inflatable slide the kids can go on. Plus, lots of neat things too look at inside the hotel. There is a 13.00 fee to park at the hotel. A couple of recommendations before your visit: Bring your own food and drink. Their food and drink prices are exorbitant. Example: 2 kids meal and one fish and chips was sixty dollars with a 15% tip. You are much better off buying a cooler and loading up with drinks and snacks if you don't want to pay the high prices. I would recommend not using their phone. They charged us $30.00 a minute for a two minute call. I was able to get the charges off my bill after speaking with the Hotel Manager. Yes, I mean thirty dollars a minute for a long distance call to Tampa.

<Title>“Not worth the money”
<Content>Gaylord Palms has a beautiful atrium and the service is pretty good. But come on, they overcharge for everything. Maybe its just par for the course in that area, but $12 drinks and $216 for a room that is not much better than a hampton inn is pretty ridculous. I had one round of drinks (4) in the bar and the tab was $50! If you must go here then make a trip right down the street to the Publix and buy any essentials and any alcohol. There is a refrigerator in the room which was nice. Skip the buffet too. Its like $31 for breakfast and $22 for lunch. And the food is really nothing special. We also ate dinner at their so called world class steak restaurant. I had to send the first steak back ($44 for an ala carte porterhouse) for being WAY overcooked. To their credit, they brought me another steak and did not charge me at all for either one. But the rest of the food was dissappointing as well. Just about everything had goat cheese in it or on it. Definately overkill. If you want a great steak and experience, go to Vitos on international drive. Its about 10 miles away.

<Title>“Amazing Conference hotel”
<Content>We were here for a conference last fall and had an amazing time . . . . this was our favorite place to attend a conference. We traveled with three children who loved the hotel as well. They were offered an amazing pool with a slide, FREE mini-golf, pool side snacks, an arcade, and a great ice cream shop. We had the breakfast buffet at Villa de Flora and the employees were so helpful and kind. I have a food allergy and they went above and beyond to accommodate me. We ate in every restaurant during the week. The 'tower' appetizer was a hit with the kids at Sunset Sam's. The food there was amazing. We loved the look of the resort, it is very family friendly. I was able to enjoy the spa and found their prices to be very reasonable. Our only problems we encountered were a few issues with check in and some of the front end employees. If your room key never needs re-issued then you'll never have a problem.

<Content>I went to the National Take Shape For Life Convention at the Gaylord Palms Resort and I was amazed at the beauty of this resort. There was a lot to see inside and so many nice places to take photo's. The outside pools were very nice and the convention center was equally nice. The food prices were a little expensive so I only ate out once. The waterfalls, landscaping and flowers throughout the resort were gorgous.

<Title>“Great Resort outside of Walt Disney World”
<Content>I have been to Orlando on numerous occassions. Never missed a year not going to WDW for 14 straight. I needed a hotel for a night which was not "Disney-focused." The price was very reaosnable considering the size of both the resort and the indivdual room. The room was very clean, well furnished, and extremely large. The bedroom is separate from the living room and both are very large. The rooms for the most part even have their own balconies that extend out into the atrium of the resort which is all glass enclosed, planted, water, restaurants, bars, and even live alligators contained within. The rooms aren't sound proofed and the noise from the activities in the atrium can be heard rather easily (and at time loudly) from the bedroom whcih face out on the atriums. That might bother someone not used to city noise, but being from NYC its a non-issue. The hotel is literally at the "mouth" of the WDW grounds. It's a quick turn out of the parking lot and not even 5 minute drive to WDW. Very close. There's nothing like staying at a Disney resort (especially if hooked up tothe monorail); however, the price ofthe Gaylord is a lot more reaosnable for those indivduals who would be on a budget. You're not giving anything up and getting a lot more as it relates to room and space. Check-in was easy and check-out equally so. Room service was ordered, available 24 hours with an ample (not stingy) selection, and arrived timely. Bathroom is large and well spaced (not to mention clean). I highly reccomend the hotel. I have stayed at the Orpyland in Nashville and this resort has the same "concept" different enclosed atriums with their own unique theme. The differences being that the themes of the atriums in Orlando are based on different sections of Florida (Key West is on example of a theme in Orlando).

<Title>“Great Vacation from Disney Vacation”
<Content>We had spent 7 days at Disney and checked into Gaylord Palms for some R-N-R. (We got a great rate that included atrium room view upgrade, resort fee, and parking.) The room was very nice and clean. The balcony overlooking the atrium was a big plus. The grounds are beautiful. And we enjoyed walking around seeing the Florida sites. We used their transportation to go to Epcot one day and we were very happy with this service. We did eat food from Cantina del Sol. The food was a bit pricey, but very good. We were a bit disappointed that the pool with the kid slide was closed for renovation. (One of the reasons that we decided to stay here.) The other pool was just fine. They had put up an inflatable slide with water, but it wasn't the same and we can't say it was the safest set up. The first day there we did see the big screen at the pool being put together. When we arrived to the pool in the evening on the second day, Toy Story 3 was just starting. This was a wonderful way to end our Disney vacation. The pool was very crowded. We did hear other people a little disappointed with this as well. It was hot and renovating the other pool at the peak of summer vacations did not seem like the wisest choice. They do offer food and beverage service at the pool. This was very slow. They did seemed to be overwhelmed by the number of people. We also had problems getting booking confirmation and there were charges to our room that should not have been there due to the package that we booked. These were taken care of with a phone call. We would defnitely stay here again, if we could get a discounted rate.

<Title>“Beautiful, unique hotel with Days Inn beds!”
<Content>The hotel itself is beautiful and unique with a huge atrium, alligators and various Florida theme sections. We had a St Augustine room with a balcony that overlooked the atrium...a wonderful feature that we loved. The room was nicely appointed with a St Augustine (old Spanish) flare, however, the bed was not up to standard. The pillows were as if someone stuffed cotton balls in them, lumpy and flat, the sheets felt like sandpaper and the bed itself was like sleeping on the floor, something you'd find at a Days Inn or something similar. A hotel of this caliber should have way nicer beds. The shower pressure wasn't great and the maid service was off too. One day we came back to find the bed half made with the pillows on the chair next to the bed...weird. We ate at the buffet one morning and it was bad. Just to give you an example, they had quiche which had been sitting out so long that it hardened. Most other samplings were cold too. Quite dissapointing especially when it's over $25 per person. All other meals were outside of the hotel because we didn't want to be disappointed with another over priced meal. We don't mind spending that kind of money when the food is good. Also, we were very much looking forward to spending the morning at the "adult only" pool until our afternoon massage treatments at the spa. However, when checking in, we were informed that the adult only pool was now the family pool while the other is being rennovated...a bad idea to do in the middle of the summer when you are busiest if you ask me. We don't have kids, but don't mind kids, however, when you are anticipating a relaxing time and instead greeted with a pool so full you can't swim freely, screaming and crying children and yelling parents, it's very disappointing. I really wanted to like this place but there were just too many wrongs for so little rights. The spa is nice though! Great massages!

<Title>“Very expansive and very nice....”
<Content>My family of 4 (wife and 2 teenage daughters) stayed here for two nights in August while visiting Disney. When visiting the Disney parks, this is probably not the place to stay, but not because the hotel isn't very nice. It is a little hard to get to from Disney property, you have to pay for parking and you also have a resort fee thrown on top of that. If you aren't going to be using the hotel facilities, then why pay for them? The staff were knowledgeable and efficient on check-in and check-out. The room was large and had a balcony overlooking the expansive courtyard that Gaylord Hotels provide. We did not use any of the facilities, but the restaurants were priced on the high side, more in line for somebody on a business account. There were alot of conventioneer types while we were there. If you do stay here, plan on walking a lot to get around. The hotel is huge and is very pretty inside. FYI...we stayed on a special that had free parking, resort and taxes, but at full price, you don't want to pay for it if you aren't going to use it.

<Title>“Went for Business, will come back for Pleasure!”
<Content>Loved the fact that this resort is almost entirely climate controlled and I didn't have to deal with the Florida humidity! Wandering around the beautiful grounds, walkways and restaurants, you forget that you are in a HUGE biosphere. Especially loved eating aboard the Sunset Sam's restaurant, where you dine on the deck of a sailboat. We had some small kids with us who spent the hour we ate, watching the fish swimming in the water below--makes for a really fun and memorable meal! We also liked sitting on a deck one evening overlooking the "bayou" at the Old Hickory Steakhouse, with crickets chirping, perfect subdued lighting and crocs nearby. It reminded me of the Blue Bayou at Disneyland. The rooms were nice--beds were a bit tall, but comfy. LOTS of pillows. Our window looked into an undeveloped area of the resort that is reported to be a par 3 or putt putt golf course in the making. The only thing that I didn't like was that incidentals that you purchased in the resort had to be charged to the room--you couldn't use cash! The vending machines for pop used ONLY room keys--same with the little shop in the swimming pool area. Overall, a wonderful experience--just wish that we had brought the kids!

<Title>“Beautiful Gaylord Palms resort Stay”
<Content>This was my first time in Orlando, but not my fist time to FL. Not knowing where I was going to be for my convention, I decided to attend anyway, a friend drove me there from the airport and I was very pleased with it, it was spacious and my room came with free internet connection service / WIFI which is a must these days. It kinda defeats the purpose when you attend a property, luxurious or not, and not have WIFI. GAYLORD PALMS delivers, even though I was at conference most of the tim,e but what a lovely feeling to come back to my room that had a balcony facing the atrium, and being to get connected.... yes I had mishaps: the first night, I was awakened at 3:30 am in the middle of the morning, and did not go back to sleep so my first conference day was tiring.... I was locked out 2nd day I was there, on my lunch break, so I wasted the whole hour dealing with maintenance so by 5 pm when I returned, I was able to get into my room. I talked the manager to get some credit and they did that. Not many delis/ affordable easts at the property, but what do you expect, it is a resort and yes there should be more options.... I love the places I went to though: Sora Sunset Sam's Fish Camp Villa de Java Coast and RELACHE spa - have amazing showers. I will visit again and loved the staff - there were friendly like me. :)

<Title>“This place was a huge let down”
<Content>Stayed here for 1 night with my mom, my moms friend and my daughter. We got a good rate that included parking and the resort fee, so I won't complain about all the extra fees people talk about. The kids pool was under construction, nothing about this mentioned when we made the reservation or befoe we got there. This was a huge dissapointment as we had planned on just hanging out at the hotel. The adult pool was open for everyone...but it is very small for the size of the resort and I have never seen a pool so packed. We didn't even get in. We wandered around and tried to do the "treasure hunt" with my daughter, but some of the kiosks were broken, so couldn't do that. Went to the game room and they have some very cool motion simulator type games...too bad they weren't working either! Went to the bar in the Key West area and had a drink. They were about to have live music, so we hung out to see how that would be. Wow it was depressing. I'm not a fan of Jimmy Buffet or anything, but you'd think they would at least play something Key Westy or slightly upbeat. The fastest song they played was "Smooth Operater". Ate dinner at the very expensive steak house. They were out of the lamb, it was not late and not busy...so I'm assuming they just didn't bother having any. The steak was ok but the sauces were all cold...not even warm. The hotel rooms were very clean! The walls are very thin. We would hear the entire conversation next door and they were not talking loud at all. The atrium also appeared very clean. But if you look off of your balcony on the ledge below...you'll see tons of trash...yuck! My moms friend had to call for help because her key wouldnt open the door, it took over 30 minutes to get someone there and that was after she called back and said she needed inside to get her insulin! She also had trouble opening the door, not sure what was wrong, but you had to push the door just the right amount while turning the knob to get it to open. Really, not good at all. The staff we encountered were always super friendly. Although it is beautiful, for the price, you can do much better than this hotel.

<Title>“They take guest satisfaction to the extreme”
<Content>My server Karen at the buffet was amazing. The entire hotel genuenly cares about their customers and it shows. I cant wait until next year when the room remodel will be complete, the new sports bar, the new waterpark, and the new health workout facilities will be completely brand new. Great place to stay.

<Title>“Fabulous, will definitely be back”
<Content>The Gaylord was everything we wanted and more than we expected. I had read some negative reviews but honestly could not find anything to complain about. The food was pricey but it was very good, particularly the breakfast buffet. I would not expect to pay bargain prices in a five star resort. All the staff I met were really friendly and very helpful. If you can, try and upgrade to an atrium room as the view is well worth it.

<Title>“Meh. Rooms are nice, food is terrible”
<Content>The rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff are very helpful and friendly. The hotel is actively using social media like Foursquare to promote offers and specials - but not all the staff understand this when presented with your "check-in" coupon. However, everyone was polite and helpful which was notable! The problem: the food is average (at best), over-priced and sometimes just very bad. At Sams, the sushi place and the steakhouse, dishes tended to be over-salted, too heavy on the butter and lacking any creativity - all for a very steep price. Wine menus and cocktails are just average also. Going outside the hotel for meals is very difficult during a convention - nothing is close by and traffic makes it hard to dash out and grab something. I have to stay here for certain conventions, but I would not recommend for families or people traveling for their own fun.

<Title>“Nice place, good alternative to Disney hotels, walk around with a hotel map!”
<Content>This location is huge. Similar to other Gaylord Resorts, the sheer size of this location gives you a lot of different areas to explore if you are interested in staying on-property. For a resort this size, it is very clean. Much cleaner than any Disney resort i've stayed at. At one point, we even noticed a team of cleaners cleaning the shrubs. Not cutting the shrubs, wiping them off with towels! Overall, a nice clean property in a good location. For

<Title>“One of a kind hotel - very unusual design”
<Content>I"ve stayed there once on business and once for pleasure. The rooms circle around an outstanding, huge atrium. There are plenty of things to keep the entire family enchanted in the three indoor Florida 'environments'. Lots to do with multiple swimming pools geared to both children and adults.. You can self-park (there's still a fee) and take the car out as often as you want each day at no extra charge....a good idea, since the hotel food is very expensive, while lots of other both chain and independent restaurants are close by, and they have more family-friendly prices. The hotel's design is so unusual that it's worth the price just to see it, if only for a night or so. Hint: there are multiple parking lots that circle the building, so don't park in the first one you come to. The place is huge and you might have a long walk to your room, so find a lot close to the part of the hotel where your room is located and enter the hotel from that area's entrance after you check in. They will give you a map of the grounds when you check in.- Use it!

<Title>“Amazing hotel!”
<Content>We came for a convention. I wish we had been able to stay longer than 5 days. It was beautifully decorated, great beds, many activities on-site for the kids. The laundry facilities were really expensive - $2.50 per load to wash and $2.50 per load to dry. Maybe that's normal for a hotel? The arcade was great. Loved the hotel's gift shops and ease of access to all the theme parks and local shopping. The service was very friendly as well.

<Title>“Nice Hotel with OK Service”
<Content>We spent 8 nights at the Gaylord Palms last week while attending our company convention. The property is beautiful however we have had much better service for a lot less money! We had a "Special Convention Rate" of $149 per night which we considered to be a fair price for July in Orlando in a hotel of this size. However when you add on the taxes, parking fees( $20 per day for Valet or $13 per day for Self Parking) and the daily resort fee we were now paying over $200 per night! And although we decided to get there a few days early, the $149 rate only applied to the "convention nights" so we paid $189 per night for the other days plus all of the other taxes and fees. The rooms are small but comfortable. On 2 occassions we had to call down to housekeeping late in the day to request to have our room serviced. The 2 complimentary bottles of water included in the $15 per day resort fee were left less than half the time. The housekeeper would leave trash and I don't think the floor was ever swept the entire week. They have a button on the phone that says "Consider it Done" and when you did ask for something they did correct it, however plan on a long wait on the phone listening to a commercial about Gaylord, before a human actually gets on the line! For the price we were not overly happy and when we departed my wife expressed he disappointment with our experience. The manager was very apologetic and we were give a credit for a few days of resort fees!

<Content>Our room was colorful and our balcony view into the atrium was fabulous! LOVED the huge atrium! LOVED the adult only saltwater pool! I attended a conference that hosted 2500 folks. The Gaylord Staff set up wonderful buffets, in a manner that didn't require a long wait. The buffet meals were great and our group was served quickly. I'm from California. When I called home, I was asked how the weather was. I had to tell them I had no idea. There were very few times I went outside! Can't wait for my next Gaylord experience!

<Title>“Exceeded our expectations in every aspect!”
<Content>We had an absolutely wonderful stay at the Gaylord Palms. I stayed at the hotel for a business convention and I brought my family. There was so much for the kids to do and explore. It realy made it easier for me, as a working mom, to marry work and vacation. The only negative I can say is that my 7 year old had never stayed in a hotel before. When he walked in and saw the grandeur of the hotel his mouth dropped as if to say "Is this what ALL hotels are like." Gaylord, you've set the bar very high! Thanks for a wonderful stay.

<Title>“Awesome resort, adequate room service”
<Content>Our family loved the resort! It was beautiful and was a great place to stay for a week, however, there were several negatives. First, the room service was horrible. We had to ASK for our 2 water bottles, towels and soaps/shampoos because they never left refills. In other words, when I should have received a total of 14 water bottles during my trip, I only got 4 and only because I mentioned it twice. Second, on-site restaurants were delicious but overpriced. Finally, the pool set-up is not convenient. There is a choice of a huge kiddie pool (which had to be emptied 3x that I know of in a week due to some child not wearing their swimmy diaper!) or an adult-only pool. The only option for teenagers is the kiddie pool... inappropriate and NOT fun for them! Hope this helps!

<Title>“Beautiful, lush, clean, relaxing. What a wonderful place.”
<Content>Spend the extra few dollars for Valet and Atrium room. My daughter with the grandchildren stayed in another room and did not use Valet. Valet is well worth the extra $7. Just remember to stop by bell services and give your room number once you check in. I did not, thinking my luggage would arrive. When I figured it out I had waited 15 minutes in the room while family was waiting at the restaurant. When I called front desk I realized I had been given a ticket by the valet to drop off. My mistake. This was the only bad experience I had. Also, do the treasure hunt. It helps to really experience and see the resort. I reluctantly did so with my 12 year old grandson. Afterwards I am glad I did. It help me to see more of this amazingly put together place. My grandchildren came over from 4 days from the beach in Daytona and said they enjoyed the Gaylords better. Now that is saying something when you can get 3 teenage boys, 12, 14, 15 to say they liked the Gaylords better than where they were right on the beach with beach views!

<Title>“Avoid at all costs”
<Content>I booked my stay on Priceline, with my criteria being a 4 star property. When my bid was accepted by Gaylord I thought I knew what to expect, having stayed in a similar property in Tennessee about 10 years ago. When I arrived the entry smelled of cigarette smoke, it was strong. Inside the air which comprises their atrium was odd (at various times throughout my one day there they seemed to add something to make it smell fresh, but the underlying air was damp and musty). I elected to self park, which I later learned meant I had the privilege of paying $13.91 for parking in a uncovered parking lot, in the baking sun, a long walk from anywhere. Who knows what the valet cost is, and you can't park for free. The room (8122) looked 4 star, but small, the beds were tightly made but the linens not special, pillows small. There was dust all over the TV and middle stand, a hair ball hanging on the hinge and the furniture was dinged up. The windows were dirty looking out to my power transmission line and road view (yes there were some trees... whew...). In the hallway there were people camping outside their rooms, making a racket, kids running up and down the halls screaming. From when I arrived until when I left there was what looked like a box of something odd and a tray of room service food in the hallway in which I had to walk about 1200 feet from the elevator to my room. It was NEVER picked up! I woke up early and got my bill. Of course I had prepaid on Priceline. My bill included my self parking charge of $13.91, and a $16.95 resort fee. I called to question the fee. They said they charged it on all rooms. I asked them to take it off as I had prepaid for a fixed price for the room. They refused. The manager was inept who I spoke to. Later, my sister indicated that the fee was for two bottles of water and internet. I tried on my iPad and my laptop to connect to the internet (wifi) unsuccessfully. Oh yes, Domestic beer, about 6 bucks, well drink, $10., didn't bother to ask for what a call drink would cost, it was too absurd. This place is out in the boondocks so the idea of your waking to alternate venues for food or beverage are out. And remember, the environment inside often is musty, no doubt a great place to transfer germs and viruses. Other cleanliness issues: mold in my bathroom tile and soap dispenser, lousy package coffee in the room and no alternative for tea, the telephone, which is a wireless, didn't work, the TV never got local channels nor the hotel billing folio information. The carpet was loose so you could see concrete etc at the window. I was thinking about a massage at their spa, but they charge more than the casino I go to in Vegas, and I really doubt they come close to the level of service that consistently exists in Vegas, so who would really bother? I'd avoid this place at all costs, and wouldn't go back if it were free, and I do like a good deal.

<Title>“Nice alternative to Disney hotels”
<Content>We decided to do the Disney Christmas Holiday thing back in 2010 with a family of four (one teenager and one "tween"). We had stayedat the Disney Contemporary Resort and the EPCOT Dolphin before. This time around, we weren't able to find good prices over XMAS, so we decided to give the Gaylord a try. The resort turned out to be great. Our rooms had a balcony that opened to the indoor courtyard. The full-size tropical plants, waterfalls, and pools/creeks, along with numerous hidden walk ways and bridges really gave the place a nice "biosphere" look and feel. The live crocodiles and turtles were a nice touch for the kids. The XMAS decoration and the live shows throughout the day also added to the holiday spirits. It's only a short ride from the resort to the park. The 24/7 valet parking staff was quick and courteous, so we never had to wait long to retrieve the rental car in the morning. Overall, the Gaylord is a nice alternative if you want to stay outside of the park, yet still get the full exotic "resort" experience.

<Title>“Great property!”
<Content>This is a beautiful property with minor issues. If you plan on spending anytime at the pool be sure to wake up early to get a chair. This property houses many rooms but yet only has about 30 to 40 pool chairs. The spa is great but is the most overpriced spa I have been to. The restaurants were delicious but again very overpriced. It was a great weekend getaway but will probably not return because my husband and I go travel to the Caribbean for a week for the amount of money we spent during our weekend stay.

<Title>“nice - but _pricey_, esp food”
<Content>I was here for a conference - and had a beautiful room with balcony that overlooked their atrium with restaurants, paths, fountains, and even alligators. They also have two pools and a small fitness center. The conference space/facilities were good. The food was expensive - but it's a convention center/resort, so what should you expect? At Sora Sushi, skip the mediocre dumplings and get the ngiri ($3/piece, definitely good sushi) instead. The rolls were uninspired, esp for $11-14 each. Sunset Sam's served great fish, entrees were $30-$35, the best meal thus far. I would recommend it for business travel, with the caveat that food is expensive; valet parking is $20/day, and self-park is $13/day.

<Title>“Worth it if you can get a good rate”
<Content>We couldn't afford to stay here normally, but since my husband and I are teachers we got a $99 rate. This is a beautiful resort and is worth staying at if you can afford it or get a good rate like we did. Since it's a convention resort, it's HUGE, so be prepared to walk quite a bit during your stay. Pros: Comfortable room/beds Plenty of vanity space Beautiful landscaping If you have kids, lots of things for them to look at/explore 2 pool areas- 1 for families and 1 for adults only. The adults only pool is warm, relatively quiet, and is salt water instead of chlorinated. I can't comment on the other pool as we did not use it. Shuttle service is efficient and runs relatively regularly. Most Disney parks have service about every hour. You have to pay extra (and quite a bit) for Universal or Sea World. Check in and check out were both easy. Wi-fi is included in the resort fee. Cons: All the extras- the resort fee was over $15 and self-parking was $13. So it was almost $30 extra dollars each day on top of the room cost. Restaurants are very expensive as you can see from most reviews. We ate off-site for everything. Everything was at least a few minutes drive. Sleeping in was difficult. The doors slam shut if people aren't careful...and they're not. The finishing touches were a bit disappointing for a hotel this beautiful. Some paint was chipped, tile/grout was sloppy in places in the bathroom, some carpeting was loose. Small things.

<Content>My employer had a convention at this hotel. I had heard it was huge so I was unsure what to expect, but it was great. I would definitely come here again for business or pleasure and I hope all our conferences are here in the future. The property is beautiful and very clean- it's like a little town under a big sky dome. The staff were very nice and gave me a huge, beautiful room close to the conference center when I requested a room change due to my disability. This room was as big as some small apartments I have seen. You could have slept a family of five in there it was so big. Lovely decor- lots of nice things to do for families and adults. The conference rooms were also very nice and easy to navigate. I only ate at one restaurant on the property but staff were super nice and made me a special gluten free meal that was delicious. They offer gluten free foods at all the restaurants on the property. There were also some lovely shops but I stopped myself from going into them knowing I would have bought something.

<Title>“Great place with kids or without”
<Content>Stayed 7 night in June, July 2011. Huge atrium in the center of the Hotel, with numerous restaurants, and shops, alligators. 2 extremely nice pools, one for kids, one for adults. The kids pool had many water spouts to get under and a huge movie screen, I think they have movies a couple times a week while the kids are in the pool. The adult pool was huge, clean, and comfortably warm. Shuttle to Disney Parks was tremendous. Shuttled to Parks before opening, throughout day and 1 hour after parks closing. Very close to Disney, when exiting park on Osceola Pkwy can see hotel through Disney World Sign that goes over road. Parking is extra and one night was very hard to find spot. Resort fee of $16. Shuttle is free. First night there are supposed to be 2 bottles water(included with resort fee), but there was only used condiments in Mini fridge. Also empty beer bottle in the closet. One day when returning to room, door was left unlocked by maid service. Rooms were nice, clean comfortable. We usually like to run Air Conditioner fan continuous, but hotel said they have a limit of 5 minutes to conserve energy. Can't blame them, the Hotel is Huge and very nice, atrium must cost a ton to cool. They have a nine hole putting course, it is complimentary and they have about a dozen putters and 20 balls, it is extremely difficult with many sand traps on course but it was pretty fun. We did not eat at hotel, prices were a little high for us, but quite a few people were using the numerous places to eat. We usually stay in the $85 dollar a night range hotel, this one I think ended up around $130 after parking and resort fees. We Would probably go back again. Staff, including maids were very nice.

<Title>“Worth every penny for the ultimate getaway!”
<Content>From the moment you arrive, you will know you have chosen something beyond any ordinary hotel experience. The moving and turning entrance doors have beach displays right inside of them, with sand and shells. SInce you already have to pay to self park-I highly recommend the valet. Only about 7 dollars more-and it makes the experience that much more exciting! The check in desk was very polite and gracious, they tell you about all the fees up front. And then you walk into the atrium, which is like entering another world! The fountains, the waterfalls, a huge ship parked right inside on a bay of water with live fish. The glass elevators, the balcony rooms around the entire place, and live baby alligators. It is a feast for your senses. The kids pool was exceptional-with so many water options for the kids-I think kids up to age 12 would love it-the teenagers might start to get bored. We at dinner at Sams fish camp(on the boat) and then spent an hour after touring the entire atrium. There was my 3 yr old, 8 year old, and myself-and we had a ball. The staff in every part of the hotel were polite. Because I had younger kids, I did not get a balcony room-the balconies are pretty low-and my kids are climbers. It also seems common sense to me that if your room has glass doors leading out to the main area of the hotel, some noise may filter through. We got a room without the balcony and slept peacefully on the very comfortable beds. The rooms were clean and decorated quite tastefully. I will say the rooms seemed small-but we only slept there and got ready for the day-so it was fine. It is so rare that I am able to travel somewhere and feel like I am in some wonderful escape merely due to the hotel I am staying in. The Gaylord is more than a hotel, it really is a destination in itself.

I liked that there was an adult pool and a family pool, even though we didn't use either during our stay.

<Title>“great size and location”
<Content>Top-notch service and great layout. We went to a conference here (nice hotel to be selected) and also took advantage of the proximity to Disney. The hotel's services, location, and rooms were excellent for a conference. Pros: Gaylord does an excellent job at providing customer services. The valet service is convenient and helpful if you need directions anywhere. Customized computers in each room can provide hotel information. Two pools (one for kids and another for adults). Cons: The room computers are not set up to surf the Internet and there is no business center. Not much of a middle ground for breakfast (either a buffet for over $20 or a small sandwich/cereal from a coffee shop). Other: We were in the St. Augustine area (central area in the atrium) and didn't have any problems with noise like other reviewers have mentioned. There are definitely cheaper hotels in Orlando, but this one is a great site for business travelers or people willing to pay a little more for amenities and ambience.

<Title>“A nice weekend getaway”
<Content>This is a very nice resort to stay at especially during the holidays. Gaylord Palms offers an attraction every year called "ICE" wherein ice sculptures are in display from, giant Santa Clause, the nativity, carousal. All made out of ice! There was a concert twice a day, everyday and a nightly Christmas concert with aerial acrobats choreography. The rooms were spacious and very clean and the housekeeping staff were great. Front office staff were helpful and polite. Breakfast was good. One has a choice to either do the the "self-parking" or "valet". Valet parking, though, is a little pricey. The resort is a few minutes drive away from the popular theme attractions in Orlando. Overall, a great place to stay for a little getaway.

<Title>“Overrated, Overpriced, and LOUD!”
<Content>Do not stay here! Why am I up at 5:30am writing a review? Because it is LOUD.. And only after a few hours sleep due to it being even LOUDER last night- Really, they need to do something about making the rooms a bit more soundproof... Rooms are nothing better than a Hilton.. After realizing that reservations were messed up and trying to get the manager to do something about it, they didn't care at all- terrible customer service. I am not impressed and would not stay here again. Place does not live up to it's expectations and what I've gotten at other Gaylords. Just not worth the money- go stay at a Disney resort- much better choice.

<Title>“Not the best Gaylord property but works for large conventions”
<Content>Think big. This hotel is a major convention hotel. Bring a good pair of walking shoes because this place is huge. The contrast between people on business and tourists is a provides comic relief when tourist start referring to me my name (on my convention badge). The FL themed atrium was a nice place to walk through from my room to the attached convention center, lots of gators, turtles and fish (in a seperate pond from the gators and turtles). The sports bar at the Gaylord Texan was much better but this works for Florida.

<Title>“Terrific! Like Vegas in Florida, and without the slots!”
<Content>We had been to the Gaylord Palms for dinner. We were impressed and wondered how it would be to stay a few days. Now, this is the way to run a hotel! Our check-in was effortless and brief, our access to our room introduced us to the atrium (4 1/2 acres of wonderfully kitchy entertainment and sets). The rooms are nice, but not fabulous. The bath was adequate (be careful: the difference between warm and scalding in the shower is a matter of a quarter-inch). But then there's that atrium again, right out the french doors onto your (tiny) balcony. At the GP, most of the rooms with balconies are on the inside of the hotel, and open on the atrium. Have you picked up on the work atrium? It's impossible to escape or avoid. From the sixty-foot schooner/bar moored in the lagoon stocked with tarpon, to the fort from St. Augustine, FL, to a three-story fish camp in the Everglades that's actually a star-worthy steakhouse, it's all in the atrium. You really don't need to go anywhere else. The buffet restaurant will keep you fed (very well, in fact), the bar will help you relax, and the wow-factor will keep you open-jawed. But if you DO go outside, check out the huge kid's pool with slides, fountains, and fun stuff to do, or make your way to the "adult swim" where you can retrieve your grown-up self after the parks. The staff is very good, attentive, and even more important, almost invisible. When you do see them, they're going out of their way to be helpful, pleasant, and just plain cute. (Except perhaps for our waiter, Tom, who referred to our favorite wine as "downscale", which made us question any of his other suggestions.) You'll have a great time at the GP. We'll be back for no good reason at all. This is too much fun to waste on a weekend when there are other things to do. Piling up in the comfortable bed, hanging in the room, or even better going over and over to that damned atrium are all on our itenerary for the next visit.

Going to the steak place tonight....heard it was pretty good. The atrium is amazing. Room size is really nice. Hotel over all is a great place. Much better and cheaper than any place on Disney property that offers the same class of service.

<Content>Have dinner in "Key West," one of the three sections of the resort. My fish order was messed up so our waiter gave us free dessert and offered to buy a round of drinks. Room was pretty, comfy bed, nice patio to look onto the lush scenery inside the bright and attractive atrium. Parking is expensive, be prepared. Service was rated less than perfect because the guy checking us in was pompous and acted as if he couldn't be bothered with us. Perhaps some continuing education in customer service is needed.

<Title>“Amazing Stay, Incredible Facilities, Wonderful Staff”
<Content>My wife and I took our daughter for her first trip to Disney this past weekend and decided to stay at the Gaylord Palms because of the ability to have fun indoors if the weather outside was the typical hot sticky Florida weather. We were so pleased with the stay, we are already talking about when we will go back and stay at the Gaylord Palms. The key reasons are below; 1. Hotel itself was beautiful, peaceful, relaxing and fun to explore 2. Staff! The staff was incredible! Everyone was extremely helpful, courteous and friendly 3. Very clean hotel, everything was immaculate 4. On-site restaurants. The food was very fresh and tasty. Sometimes you get frustrated because of price of hotel food, this is one place you will not be upset to spend it. The fish was local, wild and tasted great. The vegetables were nice, crispy and not mushy and overcooked. Also the vegetables were not just a couple carrots and mostly squash like many restaurants try to do to cut costs. 5. Shuttle buses made it very easy, time saving and money saving vs. driving to and from the parks. I highly recommend this hotel and suggest an atrium view as they are beautiful and the balconies are nice to sit on and enjoy the scenery and sounds.

<Title>“Incredible stay”
<Content>We stayed at the Gaylord Palms over the Father's Day weekend. I am 71 years old and am handicapped. My lovely wife and I were upgraded to a one bedroom suite. The front desk was superb in their desire to please. The view from our room was spectacular. All of the personnel at Gaylord were very friendly. I highly recommend this hotel for anyoine who is considering a vacation in a wonderful hotel. We are travellers who enjoy staying at the finest resorts in the world (Ritz Carlton, The Breakers, Grand Hotel Bretagne, St. Regis, etc.). We found the employees, service and overall ambience to be close to equivalent to that obtained in these type of hotels and at an excellent value oriented price. The uniqueness of the feeling that you are outdoors while still indoors is spectacular. When the storms come in late afternoon in Orlando you will be "singing in the rain" because you will not get wet and it will be about 75 degrees indoors. What a wonderful feeling to escape the rain and the heat of Orlando during the afternoon and feel so very comfortable.

<Content>This hotel was nice, big...on the downside it was secluded from the area, so we had to venture out in the evening to have dinner. The food there was pricey. We ate at the steakhouse, it was good, but not worth the money. We spent time at the mexican bar in the hotel. The bartenders were very nice, even put a phillies game on for us.

<Title>“Gorgeous Noise!”
<Content>So, we travelled over to Orlando again this past weekend to re-visit the Gaylord Palms Resort. Unfortunately it didn't meet our expectations any more so then the last time we stayed for a sleepless visit. Gaylord prides itself in it's amazing Atrium that is home to a scaled down model of Fort Matanzas in St. Augustine, a lifesize sailboat in Key West, Everglades scenery, and other wonderful natural attractions of Florida. Prices for an Atrium view room are higher then those of the exterior or "Florida View" rooms. Unfortunately if you are at the Gaylord during a convention you will have very sleepless nights if you pay the extra money for an Atrium view room. The atrium is amazing until it hits bedtime. If you are up for an all-night party atmosphere make sure to book a balcony, Atrium view and you're sure to feel like you partied all night. If you would like to sleep make sure to request an exterior room as far away from an elevator shaft as possible. If you want your stay to include sleep my suggestion would be to spend time walking through the atrium and taking an elevator ride in the Everglades section to enjoy the arial view and save the extra cash for an amazing buffet breakfast at the Villa de Flora when booking an exterior florida view room. And if you have children this is a must. Even when we visited and there was not a convention we had very sleepless nights as until late in the evening and early in the morning the staff is cleaning up and preparing for the next day of festivities - dish carts, cleaning carts, all sorts of things making noise. I noticed from about 4am - 6am there was a slight lull in commotion in the atrium but 2 hours of sleep is hardly what you want when trucking around Disney World the next day!

<Title>“Outstanding Staff - Great for Orlando Family Vacation”
<Content>From the moment we arrived until the minute we left, we were treated like royalty. The staff goes above and beyond to be helpful and courteous. Whenever we called housekeeping or the front desk our requests were answered quickly. Our children loved the pool, but there is no lifeguard, so you have to watch them carefully. There was a slide for the older kids, and a zero entry pool for our 2 year old. There are alligators on loan from Gatorland that really excited the kids, as did the large indoor garden, the fort and the swampland. There is a lot to explore here, so the kids had fun finding the unexpected. The hotel is minutes away from all of the Orlando attractions, and it is really peaceful to return back and relax in the beautiful environment or unwind at the pool. This is a really wonderful place for a family to experience Orlando.

It is time for an update to the giestrooms as the wear and tear is stating to show. A simple change should also go to the location of the tv's as they are not visable from the desk area.

<Title>“Horribly uncomfortable beds!”
<Content>The rooms have been remodeled since my last stay here about 4 years ago, and it is NOT an improvement! Our room contained massive furniture - beds, armoire; it just made the room seem even smaller. The beds are now so high that it was difficult even getting up in them and I am not particularly short! Once in bed, I found the mattress to be rock-hard - I was only able to sleep for a couple of hours at a time & woke up aching! When I complained, the girl at the desk said that they could remove the box spring & just leave the mattress or send up a chair to get in & out. As for the "firmness", she said she would see if they could find an egg crate to send up for me to put on top of the mattress, or at least send more bedding that I could pad the bed with. Nothing was ever sent to the room and no mention of my complaint was ever made again. I did not want to eat at the hotel restaurants if I could avoid it , so I usually got a carry out meal in the neighborhood & brought it back to my room to eat. But where to eat? Not the bed, obviously - too hard, too high, too messy. The desk seemed like a good bet, but between the computer monitor, the phone, and the room service menu, there wasn't much room. It was just all-around uncomfortable in the room - even the trash cans were inadequate. And no recycling in the rooms? On the positive side, employees were courteous, if unhelpful, and there was lots of room for clothes - plenty of big drawers and a nice-sized closet. My other complaint involves the resort fee attached to the room. I liked the adult pool, but one of the nights it was closed for a party and for a couple of days it was open to all ages for some reason - charging the whole resort fee doesn't seem right to me. I suppose they are almost exculsively convention business and the general feeling of the guests is "well, I'm expensing it, so at least it's not MY money". Which is great for the Gaylord, but not so good for individuals on vacation or for the companies that end up over-paying for their employees. The place has some nice attributes, but I wouldn't spend MY money there!

I flew my family down on Wed, and they stayed the night with me. They loved the place so much, we asked for a late check out on Thursday. We already had a pre-paid reservation at another resort that i could not cancell without losing what i had paid. We love the other resort as well. In short, Gaylord Palms is a great place to stay. The location is perfect. It is near everything you want to do in Orland, Fl. Stop waisiting time make your reservation already.

<Title>“Amazing hotel but not amazing for families.”
<Content>My husband recently had a conference at the Gaylord Palms so my two girls (ages 4 and 7) and I joined him. We stayed the first half of the trip in a condo-style room at a Hilton and the second half at Gaylord Palms. We were so excited to see Gaylord Palms! Let me say that the hotel is amazing! Unfortunately, it just wasn't an amazing place for a family with two little ones. The positivites about this hotel are - There is a lot to explore. The children's pool area provided hours, if not days of entertainment (zero-entry pool, waterslide, small playground, sand area, splash pad). The rooms are pretty and clean. And, it's located close to Disney and Interstate 4. We loved all of these things. However, there were a few aspects of the hotel which were challenging for a family with small children. First, after staying in a condo-style hotel first, it was hard to settle into the small, single rooms at Gaylord, especially since this hotel is so expensive! Second, since the Gaylord grounds are so large, it was a bit frustrating to get around. We had to walk a long way to the pool, restaurants and parking. So, we didn't visit the pool as much as we might have. Also, the children's pool has an octopus, which sprays water about 30 feet out into the rest of the pool. Though this feature looks fun, I noticed that hardly anyone used that part of the pool, since you were constantly sprayed in the face. It also made it difficult for parents to wait at the bottom of the waterslide for small children. I hope Gaylord will consider just cutting back on the water pressure a bit:) Third, on two ocassions we couldn't use a specific entrance/exit point because they were having a private event. So, we walked an extra 15 minutes around to get where we were going. This hotel is so large, I would think they could find countless locations for private parties, which would not require closing a frequently used entry/exit. And finally, as many other reviews have stated, the extra fees and high food prices are frustrating! They should increase the price of the room a bit and get rid of the resort fee ($15 plus tax) and parking fee ($13 per day). If you stay here, bring your own water, breakfast food, and snacks and save yourself a lot of money. Overall, I think anyone would enjoy the Gaylord Palms hotel and all of it's amenities. But for families, I think you can find a better value elsewhere.

The artisan Mac & Cheese with Lobster was so good and the goat cheese spread that came with the bread was out of this world! The highlight though was Relache Spa. It was a TOTAL relaxation experience. We had facials, manicures, and massages. To top it all off we spent time in the tea room, sauna and steam rooms. We didn't want to leave! We plan to go back next month and do it all again!

<Content>The Gaylord Palms is an awsome place. It's unique and beautiful, clean and extremely helpful staff. Checking in was a breeze, no long waits and the staff made sure I knew where I was going with a detailed map and directions. The gift shops were full of a variety of gifts with a large range of prices to very affordable to expensive. The resturaunts had great food but you will pay handsomely for the experience. The hotel room was very clean with a refrigerator that you could put snacks, drinks, etc. in it to use. Free WiFI internet in the rooms for your conveinence. The delight of the jacuzzies and the adult only pool were very relaxing. I would recommend this Hotel but the hotel resort fee and the parking fee are a little over the top, 12dlrs aday for resort fee/13dlrs a day for parking.An average family would have to plan all the costs or it could be overwhelming.

<Title>“Beautiful Place, Thin Walls, Expensive”
<Content>I stayed at the Gaylord Palms 4/25 thru 4/28. The resort is one of the the nicest I have ever stayed at. The grounds are amazing and the pools were very nice. However there were a few issues. 1. They have an adult's only pool. The sign states 18 and over. However when I went down to the pool one day it was filled with routy teenagers. It wouldn't have bothered me except we couldn't swim anywhere in the pool because they were throwing a ball that would skip across the water. At one point there was someone who worked for the resort cleaning up towels and the ball skipped out of the pool. He went and grabed the ball for them and gave it back to them without saying anything to them. There was NO inforcement by the hotel of the policy stated on the sign. 2. On two nights my wife and I were trying to go to sleep and we could hear the guests in the next room talking. They weren't talking loud, it's just that the walls are probally the thinest I have ever experienced. 3. I booked my trip on hotwire, the final price did not mention at $15 a day resort fee, but after reading reviews I was prepared to pay this fee prior to arrival. 4. The price for food was a bit crazy, I had a small yogart and my wife had ceral. Total price $10.50!!!!!! However all those things aside, the resort is really an amazing place to stay. Just bring a lot of money to throughly enjoy the resort. To get the best price possible, book on Hotwire's unpublished hotels. Look for the 4.5 star resort in Kissimee with an approval rating of over 90%. You'll pay around $85, but don't forget about the $15 a day resort fee.

<Title>“I've had better experiences”
<Content>I was not impressed with this hotel. I stayed at the Gaylord in Nashville; my stay there was so wonderful, I can't help but compare. There really is no comparison. The check-in process was not smooth; although I faxed a credit card authorization in advance, the information was not on file. Also, there was an apparent issue with my reservation that the hotel was aware of prior to my arrival, but they did not try and contact me in advance to rectify the matter. The facility is beautiful, but that's about it. The food is not good and extremely expensive. Even the dinner at the Old Hickory Steakhouse left much to be desired. The selection of restaurants/eateries is lacking. The available shopping was also scanty. The staff, for the most part, were pleasant. The one very cool thing was the complimentary feminine products in the Convention restrooms.

<Title>“Beautiful Resort.”
<Content>Gaylord Palms is our favorite place to stay in the Orlando area. Beautiful trees, plants, flowers throughout Key West, St. Augustine, and the Everglades areas. Everything is within the huge atrium which also includes water, fish, turtles, alligators and beautiful orchids. The Key West area is our favorite. Restaurants are excellent but very pricey. Convenient to Disney, shopping and chain restaurants. Can get very crowded, so best not to stay during a holiday weekend. Excellent place for family and friends of all ages. Our rooms have always been extremely nice and clean.

<Title>“Nice Hotel, but better options in the neighboorhood”
<Content>The Gaylord Palms is a very nice hotel. On site there are restaurants, 2 pools, a fitness center, spa and a shuttle to Disney property. However for the price, you might as well stay at Disney. The restaurants are expensive, the food is good, but if you have a family there are no quick options. The atriums are nice, but you are in Florida there are palm trees outside I can easily look at. The shuttle bus to the Disney properties don't seem to be to convenient. They run at odd times and sometimes could leave you stranded at a location for hours. This is a very nice hotel, but if you are thinking about staying here with your family I think there are better options. I stayed here for the only fact that I was at a convention on property.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel Spoiled by Cheerleading Event”
<Content>After an initial hiccup at check-in, we were initially very pleased with our setup at the Gaylord Palms. Lauren at the front desk took great care of us, and we ended up with an absolutely gorgeous room with a beautiful view of the atrium. The atmosphere is amazing. It is a very beautiful hotel with lots to see and do. The hotel has a great kids' pool with a very cool octopus slide. When we were there the children were not well supervised, but that is not the fault of the hotel. The hotel's restaurants are expensive. We ate at the pool bar the first evening and had great service and good food. After that, we bought some items at the grocery- there is a Publix about a quarter of a mile down the road- and stored them in the two refrigerators located in our room. We also ate at Flippers pizza which is fantastic, inexpensive and very close to the hotel. Our room was super clean and well-appointed. All of the decor seemed to have been recently updated and it was lovely. Beds were very comfortable. It would have been a perfect stay, but then the cheerleaders arrived. The hotel did not seem prepared for their descent upon unsuspecting guests. Kids were running through the halls until 2 AM and later, screaming, laughing and talking. Security seemed overwhelmed and unable to stop them from ruining everyone's sleep. (Where were their parents, anyway?) They have coffeemakers in the room, but on the last morning of our stay, we went to the coffee cafe in the hotel.The employees there were very nice and were doing a great job with the HUGE crowd. Good coffee, too. Parking was challenging due to the crowd, but initially, we had no problems. There is good security with the parking lots, and you must insert your room key to enter the parking areas if you are self parking. They also have valet service available. I would love to stay again, if the crowd was more contained or if the hotel was able to control things a little better. We did get a phenomenal deal on our stay.

<Title>“Great hotel, close to Disney”
<Content>I stayed there during Easter, and had a great experience. I got a deal at Book it for 89 dollars, which is a bargain considering that it's a 4.5 star hotel. Upon arrival we were impressed by the atrium, it's just beautiful and well kept. My daughter went crazy for the fishes and alligators. The bedroom was very spacious, with a king bed (we were promised two queens) but it worked for us. I asked one day before arrival for a crib, which wasn't there when I arrived, but a quick phone call and 5 minutes later it was delivered. The bathroom is very very nice, It has a shower but no bath. It's very modern and updated. One of my only complains is the noise level. There was a cheerleading convention at the hotel, so you can guess it was bad. You can hear doors slaming all the time and people talking. I could also hear the noise from the pool all night long and I was at the 8th floor! The kids pool, although enormous, it has some features that are kind cheesy, like a giant octopuss that I thought belonged more into those cheap old orlando hotel than this one. It was also crowded! But i guess it was because of the convention. I went to the buffet restaurant one night and was very disappointed, 23 dollars for all you can eat but the choices and quality was less than stellar. Very bad, but the service was wonderful, very attentive. There was a bartender there that came out of her way to help me. There also some hidden fees, like hotel self parking for 13 dollars, and resort fees, but still it was a bargain. All they should do is add a microwave to the room and I'll Would stay again for sure!

<Title>“Hold onto your Wallet”
<Content>Wow, I thought the National Harbor Gaylord was expensive. I attend a convention each year. For some reason the association has entered into some type of arrangement with Gaylord to "Host" the conferences for three consecutive years. $15.00 mandatory "RESORT" fee per person on top of the $220.00 plus per room. Lunch at the pool restaurant for 2: $85.00. I know room service is expensive but $45.00 for a white egg omelet with tea??? I asked for two tea bags, room services reply, "No, that is not possible, you only are to get one tea bag for one cup of tea". Never mind that there is lots and lots of coffee in the room. $29.01 for ONE call to Boston (I made the mistake of calling twice). It is 2011 not 1911. The phone company pretty much has that down. Phone calls are cheap these days, except at Gaylord. They reduced the charge to $10.15 each call after a furious phone call from me. The Gaylord is in the middle of no where. You are forced to stay there and eat and buy stuff there unless you have a car or take a taxi. Parking fees, you don't want to know... I ask for a "TAXI", "Right outside", is the reply. Funny this isn't a taxi, it is a car service. Gaylord only allows "their" car services to wait outside. $45.00 for a 10 minute trip down the street to a shooping plaza. $25.00 for the taxi back. We got smart and called our own taxis. Believe me, you cannot walk to anything. My workshop... We needed an extension cord for 90 minutes.... $22.00. And they said they needed to charge "Labor" on top of that. Thankfully, that person did not charge us for the "Labor" of taping the plug to the floor. I actually did the actual "Plugging In". My conference next year is in "DALLAS", but it is really Grapevine, TX. I will walk miles or get a taxi to get to my conferences before I stay at another Gaylord.

<Title>“Fabulous”
<Content>This hotel is fabulous. The atrium is amazing - the landscaping and the wild life work wonderfulyl. The restaurants are clever and there is a nice variety. They are a bit pricey - but it is expected at a resort. The rooms are great - good beds and pillows. The pools are perfect. The location is ideal. Its not more than 20 minutes to anything you'd need. The service is very good for a property of this size. My kids LOVED it. There really is nothing else like this hotel. We have stayed in Disneyworld in the past - and really - this is better.

<Title>“Great experience, but may not spend another fortune to go back!”
<Content>My fiance and I stayed at the Gaylord Palms for a long weekend, 3 nights/4 days, and it is a LOVELY facility! I won two free nights and we purchased the third night which wound up costing us $300 (just for the room) We had a room facing into the atrium with the waterfalls directly outside which was perfect for us, we slept with our patio door open every night and the sleeping sounds were great. A couple of evenings, though, there were events in the atrium area and you can hear every word on the mic echoing thru the building, like being in an auditorium with bad acoustics, very echoey. The food was great, but overpriced.. I suppose that's what we get for staying in a resort in Orlando, but we did not have a lunch or dinner that was less than $80 including tip. As far as food goes, our favorites were the Sora Sushi for dinner (edamame, 3 maki rolls and 2 drinks each ran us $110), Cantina del Sol for lunch, and the mediterraenean buffet for brunch. The drinks were weak everywhere (except for the sangria at brunch), and drinks were $12+ each.. I do not recommend room service! We were very disappointed with all of the food we ordered thru room service, and ps, the "fresh" guacamole is NOT good. We enjoyed the adult only pool, they play music throughout the day and there are always servers from Cantina del Sol coming around with drink and food menus! This is a very beautiful resort with great service and amenities, we were very impressed and I'm sure there is plenty for families to do, particularly with the parks in the Orlando area, but other than the pool and restaurants (and the gators were fun to watch) we were not blown away and are not rushing to go back.

<Title>“If size matters...”
<Content>If you need a room block of 2,000 rooms, look no further. This place is huge...think of mid-range Las Vegas casino without the casino part. You get a map from the front desk to find your room...if you get lost, there is a number to call to get you to your room. Really. I always kind of groan a bit when I have a conference in one of these Gaylord mega-properties. Rooms are a bit dull for the cost...nicely decorated in 1995, but a bit outdated. There are flat-screen TVs but there's also this nifty computer "i-Connect" terminal in the room (mine was not working, problem was reported but not resolved) where you can order your mini-fridge to be stocked or order room services, etc. The beds are firm and are on very high frames. There's a sign in the room that notes "modern" bedding and furniture are in the near future, so maybe a refresh is coming. It's not all bad...the Sunset Sam's Fish Camp (ahi tuna BLT) and Old Hickory Steakhouse (NY Strip with Bordelaise) were absolutely wonderful meals. Old Hickory has an impressive wine list...mark-up from retail is about 2x...a few notable bottles on the list. Villa de Flora is "OK." They actually had chocolate mousse on the breakfast buffet. Noise level for the Atrium rooms is insufferable when the place is sold out for conferences. When I was there, they were breaking down and moving tables and chairs from corporate dinner events as late at 11:30 p.m. - sounded like an elevated training running past my balcony, but was hand-trucks, 5 floors below. The Atrium is the highlight - well worth seeing: beautifully kept flowers and foliage...fascinating alligators and fish to watch. A mandatory $15 resort free provides local calls, internet access, daily paper (which you have to pick up - not delivered to your door), and 2 bottles of water per day (stocked in your mini fridge). Unless you're staying here for the convenience while at a convention, I'd suggest coming here for lunch at Sunset Sam's or dinner at Old Hickory, touring the Atrium, and sleeping elsewhere.

<Title>“Nice but too expensive”
<Content>We recently stayed at Gaylord Plams Resport & Spa.......they charge for EVERYTHING! Even self-parking is over $13 per day! A dinner for two at their stgeak house was over $200.00. They also charge a daily "resort" fee of $16.95 per day which only includes a bottle of water each daye . What we thought was a great deal turned in to an extremely expensive vacation! Not only that, we asked for a room with two queen beds and got a room with two double beds............... A beautiful place but there are many other places to stay in the area without all the added expenses. Another thing, they shut the pool down for duck fecies in the pool....all they did was throw "shock" into the pool....the fecies were still there the nexy day.

<Content>Had a conference at the hotel, so was there for 3 days. Wanted to lounge at pool the final day. Unable to get late check-out, so manager gave me a complimentary pass to the spa so I could shower, etc. before leaving for the airport. Class Act! The entire staff was very friendly, helpful. The rooms were great; the hotel is beautiful. Absolutely no complaints.

<Title>“A destination in itself”
<Content>We have stayed at Gaylord properties before, so we expected the property to be over-the-top. It was. From the beautiful pools to relaxing balcony overlooking an atrium, our night at the Gaylord Palms was a retreat from the hustle and bustle of Orlando. My only complaints are the price of food, although we expected it to be this way going in. I was also disappointed in the noise level coming from the atrium in the middle of the night. The room needed to be soundproofed better, particularly the gap in the balcony door. We booked on a website using a "name your own price' feature. We paid about 25% of the market rate for the same night on the hotel website. I would stay at this property again, as long as I dont pay anywhere near market rates. Its great!

<Title>“Outstanding resort/hotel with awesome atrium”
<Content>The Gaylord Palms in Kissimee is such a nice resort that pays attention to all the details. The walkways from one area of the hotel to another are fabulous. You would never know that everything was covered...the curved pathways, ponds, lush greenery, "street signs" indicating locations of everything all gave it an outdoor appeal. This was definitely the best business hotel i've been to. Most of the time at our business meetings we are stuck in the hotel 22 hours a day...2 hours/day you might get a chance to go outside :) With this in mind having the atriums and beautiful "landscaping" made the inside of the hotel fabulous. i would love to stay here again for a business meeting. The food was excellent as well. The fitness center was nice and had all the major exercise equipment (I usually use either the treadmill or precor/elliptical machines.) You will love it here!

<Title>“Fun experience”
<Content>I stayed for 3 nights with a Grand Atrium view, which was spectacular. It was fun to walk around the atrium and enjoy the beautiful view from the room. My complaints: We only ate ice cream and breakfast one time each over the course of 3 days. It is too expensive for meals, which is disappointing for those times you just want to enjoy the hotel. My party wanted to grab a meal there but we were disappointed with the selection. We were going to try the seafood restaurant in the Key West area but there was only seafood on the menu and not everyone eats seafood. We took the free transportation to Disney, which was really convenient. I would stay here again as an alternative to Disney. The adults only pool and the lack of little screaming children running around was very nice.

<Title>“Avoid. Overpriced. Poor. Never ever again. Wild horses.”
<Content>Title says it all. We are happy to pay £35 ($50) for a good bottle of wine in a nice restaurant. Here we paid $31 for a $10 (max) wine. $30 per head for us and the kids each for average food and a modest choice. Great relaxed surroundings and obviously very friendly but nOt at that price! We came away very unsatisfied (but full) and vowing never to cross the doorstep again. Very, very, average and don't fall for the hype. I'd recommend you try Chili's or Applebee as being much better value. Having said that, the sheer variety of human life that you can see here affords a premium for the people watcher. $9 for a small Pinot grigio.

<Content>yes, we all make that annual Florida trek to check in on relatives and give us a break from our wonderfully woolly northern winters, but we need a break from those well-intended relatives, so we book a room at a nice resort and let nature do the rest. Well, if that be the case, I'd recommend Gaylord Palms. It was very nice. Pools were very nice, with a separate "adults only" pool. Staff were very attentive, room was excellent, food was great. All you need is a fine rate from Priceline and you are on your way.

<Content>Just got back from our stay at the Gaylord and we were thoroughly impressed. The hotel was large and had everything you could imagine on the grounds including mini-golf, two pools, volleyball area, many restaurants, shops and bars. Only complaint was that on the third floor, we would hear all the commotion in the central area of the hotel throughout the night. It echoes like an auditorium. But otherwise, it was a spectacular hotel

<Title>“Great stay!”
<Content>I just returned from a four night stay mid-March at the Gaylord Palms Orlando. My husband had a conference there and our daughters (9 and 11) and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute exploring this massive hotel. We first stayed here three yrs ago and it seemed easier to navigate around this second time. It was overwhelming the first time. We stayed in a king suite on the top floor (wow what a huge, gorgeous room) with wonderful views of the hotel's atrium. I wondered if I would have preferred a view to the outside world but LOVED the interior views! It was beautiful at night with all the lights and listening to the fountains. Once our balcony doors were closed it was super quiet in our room. Our king suite was extremely spacious with a huge bathroom. Very comfortable king bed, the girls slept on the queen sleeper sofa in the living room. Super clean every day and housekeeping even made towel elephants one day for the girls. The hotel staff, from housekeeping to front desk to the restaurants were always friendly and helpful. We loved a few of the ladies at Java Coast (where we ate breakfast a la carte each morning) and Haagan Daz (they work back and forth between the two places). We LOVED the gator feeding, the rep. from Gatorland was terrific with the kids and answered all their questions. We spent most of our free time at the children's pool. There is no lifeguard but they do have a hotel employee (looked like security?) sitting at the pool each day who would caution children getting too rowdy or misbehaving on the slide. I liked that. The hotel seemed to do a great job handling the large conference my husband attended. I'm sorry guests who attended the hotel during the holidays and ICE were so disappointed. Our experience was EXCELLENT and I would highly recommend this hotel. As other travelers have expressed, this hotel is an experience! Our children loved every minute here and were NEVER bored. Our family will definitely stay here again!

The staff are so friendly from the valet, front desk, and restaurant personnel. It's top notch. Anyone wanting to have an experience like no other, you have to stay here at least once. The Key West area with the boat, The St. Augustine area with the Castillo de San Marcos or the Everglades with the gators, snakes and turtles, who wouldn't want to be there.

<Content>We traveled with our 1-year old. We had a blast at this hotel. Everything was spotless. The grounds were beautiful - there wasn't even a dying flower to be seen! There was so much to do - walk the atrium, family pool with splash zones & slide, adult only pool, jacuzzis, mini-golf, shopping, spa, fitness center, dining, strolling the premises outide, etc. The room was clean. The service was fast and friendly. We decided to extend our stay another night but wanted to received the same rate (not some crazy rate because it was a last minute decision). It was not a problem at all!!! We were delivered our new keys in minutes! The onsite food was yummy! Were things a little pricey?? Sure - but it's Orlando and it's a fabulous resort. You get what you pay for! I would recommend this place to anyone!! I haven't stopped talking about it since I got home.

For a large upscale hotel, the gym only opens at 5am (why not 24/7 ?!). I guess families sleep in. Business travellers don't, and they have deeper pockets. A small number of cardio machines that were at the low end of the scale (and of course full @ 5am given the large number of rooms), TERRIBLE free weights, a few ok machines. VERY dissapointing.

<Title>“A City under one roof”
<Content>The place is overwhelmingly massive. Able to accommodate very large groups. Spa $ 30.00 yieks! Old Hickory Steakhouse ( inside the property ) - $ 100 meal per person with wine. Memorable meal, but a sting in the pocket book. Your room bill comes with: Tax per night $ 25.00 County Tax per night $ 2.42 Resort Fee per night $ 16.95 Total = 44.37 extra add-on per night

<Title>“Everything under one roof!”
<Content>I traveled to Gaylord Palms with two colleagues to attend a National Sales Convention for an ERP company we are evaluating. This place was amazing with the mix of indoor and outdoor spaces. Definitely a great place for meetings and conventions as just walking from room to room is enjoyable. The food and drinks at the numerous restaurants and bars can get pricey but I would assume most guests also are there on business where it generally is on the company.

<Title>“Kinda cheesy, but in a luxurious way”
<Content>So you've seen the pictures - the fake fort, fake boat, fake Everglades etc. Cheesy? Yes. Better than an empty expanse of concrete and carpet, with only token potted plants? Most definitely! You get inside rooms with a view, greenery, some nice places to stroll or sit no matter the weather, and you could probably have five private functions running concurrently in the main atrium without anyone running into each other. Stayed here for a 2000-person conference. Had an outside room in the Emerald Bay section, 5th floor, overlooking the children's pool and conference center; no noise issues from there. Most of the inside rooms have balconies, but only a few outsides do (mine didn't). Right next to a service area, which *was* pretty noisy (fortunately, I can sleep through anything). For the price ($200/night), the room was rather small, though very well appointed - nice furniture, upscale bathroom, flat panel tv etc. Sadly, they've jumped on the dim lightbulbs bandwagon. And, of course, the mandatory resort fee (GRRRRR) - $16 for a newspaper (which you have to pick up downstairs yourself), 2 small bottles of water and access to the gym. WHOOP-DE-DOO. The convention ran pretty well, though not quite as smoothly as a much larger one I attended recently at a more downscale resort - signage, buffet placement etc could have been better here. Convention food was quite good considering the number of people served (all buffets). Plenty of women's restrooms (no waiting in line! Yay!). Also ate twice at Villa de Flora, their Mediterranean buffet. Each night featured a different emphasis - e.g. night 1 was French, night 2 was Spanish, a night we skipped was Italian. Everything was excellent and there were far more choices than you could possibly try out (easily a dozen mains, probably more, plus apps, sides, salads, desserts...mm, dessert...). Tables are scattered around in various levels and rooms, so it felt nice and intimate, though it seats a large crowd. That's probably the default restaurant everyone uses, though there are several others, plus the coffee shop, lounges, etc. Service everywhere was first-rate. (Do they poach employees from Ritz-Carlton?) The one thing I didn't appreciate is that nickle-and-dime feeling. The resort fee. $3.50 for a basic cup of coffee. The dim lightbulbs. You're already paying a lot for the room, so the taste of those things lingers. Anyway, I highly recommended it for a group that can afford to be spendy.

<Title>“Mom's Birthday Surprise”
<Content>We have wanted to stay at Gaylord Palms for years. This year myself and our two daughters took my mom to celebrate her "39 and holding" (really 74) birthday. Everything was perfect. We overlooked the atrium, enjoyed Sunset Sam's where they sang to mom and had a great time exploring the property. Gaylord Palms is a theme park in itself offereing the best of Florida in one location. REally enjoyed it!

<Content>Pros: large clean rooms; friendly helpful staff; some people complain about the "biodome" feel of the place but I kind of like all the live plants and running water. Decent place to spen 2-3 on business. Cons: restaurants and bars way over-priced; no restaurant alternatives walking distance from hotel; music from boat/lagoon area carries into all guest rooms on that part of hotel; $50 cab ride from airport.

<Title>“'Gators, turtles, cypress trees and waterfalls all from your balcony”
<Content>The Gaylord Hotels are amazing resorts. At the Palms the atrium encloses an entire park and restaurant complex that is unique. We needed a couple of days away and stayed at the Gaylord Palms for two nights. It is not as large or diverse as the Gaylord Texan or National; however the fountains and indoor lagoon are fantastic. The turtle and alligator pond was great and there were plentiful dining options. Orlando weather in March is unpredictable and we chose the Gaylord for the indoor park with its walking paths and scenery. Temperatures fluctuated outside from chilly with rain to sunny and hot, which made us appreciate the indoor park setting. The food trends toward trendy and away from complexity. Our seafood entrees were good, but not great, but we understood we were paying for the ambiance of dining on a boat in a lagoon with sting rays and tarpon swimming around us. We do agree with complaints over the many hidden fees and less than stellar housekeeping service. Overall it was a great experience and we would recommend the hotel to other couples looking for a place to unwind.

<Title>“Nickel and Dime you with Fees!!”
<Content>Got what I thought was a great deal on priceline for $65 plus $16 in "fees". Once I checked in they told me there was a mandatory "resort" fee of $15 plus tax. They also asked if I self parked or valet parked. I told them I self parked and all they said was "okay". The next morning upon checkout I was charged a $13 plus tax fee for self parking. My $65 dollar rate ended up being $110. The hotel is VERY nice and totally worth the $110 however I feel like I was deceived, and am not real happy with the whole process. I blame half of this on priceline as they tell you that you must check with the hotel prior to booking to find out all of the fees. Problem with that is that you don't know what hotel you are going to get until you blindly book it. Also, the hotel is HUGE!! They give you a map when you check in , and you NEED it for the first day at least. I had to take two separate elevators to get to my 6th floor room. Kind of a pain... Not sure if I would stay again.

<Title>“When can I come back??”
<Content>The Gaylord Palms Convention Center hosted the PHH Mortgage 2011 National Sales Conference this year in Kissimmee FL. Our theme was "Right Here, Right Now," and we were definitely there. The staff made sure we all had a good time and we were very comfortable during our stay. From the check-in to the check-out every detail was covered. This was the best convention I have ever been to and Gaylord Palms deserves my appreciation for a wonderful stay. If you are in FL consider staying at this amazing resort.

<Title>“never disappointed...will continue to return”
<Content>This is the my third visit to Gaylord Palms in the past 7 years. The hotel is magnificent. You are living in a city under an atrium and everything looks authentic and beautiful. We stayed in the Key West section this time. It's so nice to walk around and go to all the shops and restaurants. Everyone there was very helpful and hospitable. Our room was decorated nicely and was very clean. The only thing I didn't like, was my husband requested an outside room because during our last stay, it was hard to sleep with the inside room because your balcony is right over all the night life and can get loud. Our outside room was lacking in the view department, our view was partical pool and roof tops. On the weekend we were a little disappointed because they closed the adult pool at 2:30 in the afternoon for a private party. We had no choice but to use the kiddie pool, which is not relaxing. I also wish they would do more to recycle. There were no recycling bins in the hotel rooms or that I noticed by the pool. Most importantly, the hotel is goregous, friendly and relaxing. I really liked that there were desktop computers in all the rooms and we were abler to take care of all our needs through the internet. We even got to hand pick our drinks and snacks for the room fridge. This was so much easier then having to call room service for all your needs. The housekeeper was great, everything so fresh each day and she took great care of us. The resort is just a hop, skip and jump from all the disney resorts and parks. We enjoy going to Disney's Boardwalk, and it's a short drive and both Boardwalk and Gaylord have free parking if you do not use the valet. Also, not many people realize it, but it's a close, pleasant walk from the Boardwalk to Epcot. I'd prefer parking at the Boardwalk then in a theme park, parking lot any time. We visit Disney regularly, and have stayed at the Carribbean Beach Resort, Yacht Club, Wide World of Sports (never again) , and our favorite is the Boardwalk Resort. Gaylord Palm is just as nice as the Boardwalk. I look foward to returning there next year.

<Title>“Not what I expected”
<Content>When you hear Gaylord you think nice. You would also think they might vacuum occasionally. You would also think that the bed wouldn't be made out of 2X4 lumber. I sleep in a lot of hotel beds and this one is straight out of Cancun. Those of you who have been to Cancun probably know what I mean. If the carpet wasn't filthy I would sleep on the floor because it is probably softer. Stay somewhere else.

<Title>“Spectaular”
<Content>By far, this was one of the greatest hotels we've stayed at. This stay was a repeat stay from the year before. We had to stay here the past 2 years for my son's soccer tournament at Wide World of Sports as it was the hotel the team/club chose. We enjoyed all the amenities offered. The only thing bad I'd have to say is the cost of food. Even though there are several restaurants in the resort, they were all expensive! We ate out just about every meal and brought in breakfast. For what you get you pay for!

<Title>“The best we've stayed in Kissimmee”
<Content>I live Florida and have and I have been going to this area for many years. The hotel was clean, the staff was friendly, and the room was large, updated, and very comfortable. I can not understand a previous review that said the property was "old and dated", I didn't see that anywhere. I used to stay at another nearby hotel until it was sold this past year and the new owners did not maintain the property to the previous standard. This made me find a new place to stay, and i am very glad to have found the Gaylord. In the center of the hotel property there is a stadium sized gazebo with tropical plants and live alligators! Being a Floridian, I do not get too excited about alligators, but if you are from out of town it would be neat to see them this close. The only downsides to the property are the rooms can be a long walk from the elevator. It was not a problem for us but, if you have mobility problems ask for a room close to the elevators. Also, we got back around 11:00pm and were looking for a bar/restaurant on property to have a drink and a late snack, but everything was closed (on a Saturday night). There are no bars/restaurants even close to the property so we went without. Also, if you self-park there is no clear signage showing you where to park, so we had to drive around a little until we found it. Overall, it was a very good experience and I plan to stay there again in the future.

We would never be able to afford this hotel, however, if it weren't for the AMAZING military discount. at $83 a nite, we can easily afford this but the usual 250+ fees would not make it worth it. Food is great but VERY expensive to eat at hotel.

I change rooms nothing worked, they sent a repair man. I was on the phone with my husband and told him how I took pictures it was so bad. Repairs got done and my camera seemed to disappear too. Guess no pictures with this review. Worse part is all my photo's of my kids at Disney and with my friend and her new 2 week old baby, took lots of pictures of our kids together. Can't replace those photo's.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel, Quiet, Clean Rooms, Wonderful staff.”
<Content>The hotel is gorgeous. Beautiful plants, flowers, trees and waterfalls all inside the gigantic atrium. The room we stayed in was in the Everglades section with a "Florida view" (meaning the window overlooked the parking lot) and it was extremely clean and quiet. I found the beds comfortable. The staff is very nice and very helpful. The Villa de Flora buffet is fantastic, although a bit pricey. The only drawback to this hotel is that it is out in the middle of nowhere, so unless you have a car or take a cab or shuttle, you are pretty much not going anywhere else to eat or shop. They have a 24 hour coffee shop/deli that was fairly reasonably priced, and I was able to pick up little things like yogurt or a banana or cereal in the mornings without having to go to a restaurant. There are refrigerators in the rooms, so I was able to purchase my yogurt, etc. the night before and have it in the morning in my room, which was nice. The hotel atrium has all sorts of nice places to sit and relax to the sounds of the waterfalls (actually the atrium is so beautiful and amazing-- it's difficult to describe! Check out the hotel website for photos.) They have a very nice salt water, heated adult pool that we thoroughly enjoyed. The children's pool is at the other end of the hotel and is also quite nice. We had a wonderful stay and can't wait to go back!

<Title>“Dissappointment, would not have brought my family with me if I had known.”
<Content>There were numerous problems that arose all within three hours of my check-in. Upon arrival, I was told that there were no king beds available, despite the fact that I had reserved one and had confirmation. Then after protesting, somehow a room with a king bed magically appeared. When we got to our room we found it to be small and cramped and on the exact opposite side of the property from the convention I was there to attend. Upon exploration of the grounds, we found both the casual dining restaurant and the children’s pool area were closed for renovations. Neither of which were disclosed to us upon reservation OR check in. I would not have brought my husband and my 3 year old daughter if I had been informed in advance that there would be nothing for them to do on site. And, no, the adult pool was not an option as my daughter is THREE, the same goes for the sushi bar and seafood restaurant (allergies). After all this, upon returning to our room we found a security guard and maintenance man in our room WITHOUT prior notification. Supposedly they were fixing the television, but as NONE of the Hotel features on the television were working, I have to question this. When I approached the front desk with these issues the only reply I received was “What do you want us to do? We can’t just open the pool for you. It is undergoing annual maintenance.” When I asked that if this is ANNUAL maintenance, why I wasn’t notified in advance? Tthey just said that they didn’t know. Overall my stay was highly dissatisfactory. I will not be recommending this “resort” to my friends, family, or business associates.

<Content>This was the first time I'd stayed at a Gaylord. I am used to staying at a resort hotel for this annual conference, but the Gaylord's service went beyond my expectations. The staff was extremely helpful and very friendly and eager to lend assistance. From the bellhop to the front desk, to the concierge, all were exemplary in their performances. The room was quiet at night. The bed was extremely comfortable as was the pillow. I often wake up with a stiff neck and/or shoulders, but both of these problems were absent for the entire 4 day trip. All of these added up to the best night's sleep I've ever had in any hotel. I will only stay at the Gaylord from now on when I travel to this conference!

<Title>“Loved it...best Christmas ever!”
<Content>We stayed here for 3 nights, arriving on Christmas Eve. We decided to pay to upgrade to a suite and it was simply stunning...so exciting to be spending Christmas in such lovely surroundings. We had booked on the Xmas package which included access to SNOW and ICE, we had such fun over the days we were there. The kids pool area was great and the pool was lovely and warm. It was salt water, so no chemicals upsetting my daughters skin. We ate in 3 restaurants and loved all the food and great service. We tried the sushi restaurant (have never eated it before), asked the waitress to recommend a few dishes and wow! I have never tasted food like it....such flavour. The bisque was amazing....I did asked for a barrell of it to take home! The entertainment (which was free for everyone) was brilliant and so professional. This hotel and it's staff really made our Christmas special, and I would recommend coming here to everyone as the grounds alone are spectacular, even if you want to visit to have a look! Thank you to everyone at the Gaylord Palms

<Title>“Anniversary under the Dome”
<Content>To start we entered from the convention center by mistake, my fault, but that ment we had to walk through the hotel to find the loby. Jaw dropping is the first thought I had. The scale and opulence under the Atrium litterally takes your breath away. You quickly begin to wonder how did they do this and how do they maintain it. The streams of fish, alligators, lush trees and plants all under the glass dome is mind blowing. Check in and all other services were quick, and helpful and given with a very pleasant , concerned attitude. Holiday shows,(free of charge) were first rate. The only complaint was navigation was difficut but due to the size of the place unavoidable. New Years eve was a very pleasant celibration. Can't wait to come back

<Title>“Fun Times”
<Content>Was greated promptly and front desk great! Ice show was fabulous! My 3 year old grandson loved the ice slide!!! Snow show was sold out on our stay though. Lots of options on food! 1 st night I took my grandson to eat on the "boat" great friendly staff! Just the 2 of us. I raved so much about the experience that I brought my daughter and son in law the next night. Unfortunatly was greated at the dock by an angry waiter? Who told us there was a 45 min wait....not polite at all HUGE disappointment ... there is a proper way to tell someone there is a wait. This young man had absolutly no tact or manners...what a shame! Coffee shop great staff! Sushi staff great also! Valet GREAT!!! Too bad front staff at boat dock eatery was horrible! Oh almost forgot! Room service was GREAT!!! fast and good!!!

<Title>“Gaylord Palms - Be careful!!”
<Content>We were excited to spend the New Years Eve weekend at the Gaylord Palms and took my new fiance there for the first time. We were excited to get there and see the ICE show too. However, when we got there to check in at 3pm, they made us a nice offer to upgrade our room to a suite for only $100 a night, but the room was not ready, but would call me on my cell phone. We thought that was a great deal and waited 3 hours for call to tell us our room was ready. We visited the room on the 7th floor that they assigned and it was beautiful, with a kitchen table and everything. We went to go pick up our keys, and they stated they accidentally gave our room away and offered us "an executive suite" on the first floor at the end of the hotel. We couldn't believe this!! We spoke to the trainer and he said he would get us the same room on the other side of the Atrium, but the room was not ready. It was now 7pm and the room was finally ready after 4 hours of waiting. We entered the room and saw it was not the same room, but "an executive suite" that was not much larger than a regular room for $100 a night. At that point, we just took the room because we had dinner reservations at 8pm and didnt want to totally ruin New Years. We definitely got scammed. As a manager for a major pharmaceutical company that holds many events and meetings at this hotel, we will not longer be holding meetings there after this experience and will take my business elsewhere. Thanks for the scam!!

<Title>“Enjoyed our visit”
<Content>My husband and I visited the Gaylord Palms December 29 to January 1. The hotel is huge but both my husband and I felt that was one of the things we liked the most. The Gaylord Palms is more of a destination than a hotel. There are shops, restaurants and because we were there around the holidays there were several shows each evening and ICE and SNOW. Being from upstate NY we didn't feel the need to see Snow but ICE was wonderful. We had a Florida view room in the Emerald Bay that was large and well appointed. We had dinner New Year's Eve at the Old Hickory Steakhouse. While not inexpensive by any means we had a great meal. The 24 hour Java Coast is a great idea. You can get coffee, sandwiches and such at your convenience. We were a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews but we enjoyed our visit and would probably stay at the Gaylord Palms again.

<Title>“Very Memorable Christmas Stay for Our Family”
<Content>We traveled to the Gaylord Palms Resort on Dec. 23rd for the ICE! and SNOW events. It was the first time we ever stayed there, and we had a very nice time. I found the hotel staff to be delightful and helpful in every way! The hotel was beautifully decorated, and the shows were pretty good. There was a definite feeling of warmth and Christmas cheer. We didn't eat at the hotel, but the coffee shop was good, and there was a nice selection of shopping. My kids really enjoyed the Polar Bear Pursuit. We did NOT find the hotel overly crowded, and we had no problems checking in. We loved the ICE exhibit, it was absolutely beautiful! It was well worth the price, and as Floridians, our whole family had a blast on the ICE slides! It is very cold, so be well-prepared, and you will do just fine! The whole family really enjoyed it, and we got some wonderful pictures. As for the SNOW exhibit...it was cute, but too small. My 10-year-old thought it was lame, but my 6-year-old loved it. We all enjoyed the tobogganing, but the 45 minute time limit was not enough, considering it seemed very crowded. I am glad we had the combo ICE/SNOW discount ticket, because I wouldn't have wanted to pay so much for just for SNOW. I don't think it was so bad since we kinda tacked it on to ICE, though. I look forward to visiting the resort on a warmer occasion, as the themed pool areas looked very inviting. The resort is broken up into different "areas" of Florida. There are baby alligators in the St. Augustine section, fish and stingrays in Key West, and snakes in the Everglades! It's kind of a neat place, whether you are there for a holiday or not. Now, I'll admit, the rooms WERE too dusty, so housekeeping needs to step it up a bit on that. And there were a lot of fees, but ALL the resorts in Orlando have these fees, so it is not unusual. We stayed for $89 with the FL resident special, which was a STEAL for a hotel of this caliber. Overall, it was a nice stay, and we will definitely go back.

<Title>“Fun Unique”
<Content>Traveling with a group - got a special rate here but normal prices are a bit too expensive. It certainly fits in with the Disney theme parks in the area. The hotel rooms surround a courtyard that is designed to appear as a small town. There are restaurants, coffee shop, stores, a spa and a stage show. Gorgeous tropical vegetation and a large stone fort give the impression that you are outside. I was lost for almost my whole stay - the place is HUGE. Prices tend to be less than expected in some restaurants, more in others.

<Title>“Some great, some not so...”
<Content>While this hotel is impressive in size and decor, it is too big for my taste. I'd rather not have to walk 1/4 mile for a cup of coffee in the morning. (I don't drink the in room coffee.) My son (5) loved the kids' amenities: GREAT and warm outdoor pool, hottub, free mini golf. The facility was really clean, but we had poor room service/cleaning...even after calling the desk to say that the room had not been cleaned. They still only dropped off clean towels. The beds, for that money, should have been heavenly in my opinion. They were no better than a mid chain grade bed. The restaurants were very pricey, and we splurged and ate at the buffet style Mediteranian one, and it was good. Just good. At 65 dollars for and adult and a child for brunch, I want great. The staff was all very friendly, the shows were plentiful, exciting stuff for kids...alligators, turtles, fish, and stingray in the hotel pools, the shops were nice and we could purchase our Disney tickets there...but overall, I think Id rather stay at a less expensive hotel, get the same basic needs met, and buy our entertainment.

<Title>“Repeat Guests at Christmas...”
<Content>I am an officianado of Orlando hotels, and I have particular ones that I go to at particular times. We have been going to Gaylord Palms for years at Christmas. We started because of the huge atrium that, particularly at Christmas, allows for a myriad of activities without leaving the hotel. During Christmas, they have 5-7 shows during the day that are roughly 20 minutes. The shows have singing, dancing, and aerial acrobats. This is really great if you are traveling with elderly people who would just like to sit and watch the shows or if you have young children who would love the atmosphere that the atrium offers. We love the Ice exhibit, and the Snow exhibit is a nice addition. I do agree that it is expensive, but if you book the Best of Christmas in Florida package, you get repeated entrance to the two exhibits during your stay. Be warned, the atrium rooms are loud while the shows are ongoing, but the shows end by 9:30pm or so. I should also say that the room service is VERY speedy and the breakfast is not outlandishly priced. Now, there are two things that I hate about Gaylord. 1) The check in process is tedious and does take a long time. My advice is to arrive at off hours which will significantly reduce the wait. 2) DO NOT GO TO THE SPA unless you want burnt eyebrows and a tiny (read : the size of a closet) pedicure room. I have other favorite spas that I drive to instead of Gaylord's. I will return to the Gaylord at Christmas because of the the various activities offered for the entire family. Any other time of the year, I go to the other hotels that I enjoy around Orlando.

<Title>“Didn't care for the changes to the pool...”
<Content>We stayed many times before, and the pool was always open 24/7, which to us it meant being able to swim at night, and sit around to talk in the heated pool, at night time was the best because the pool will not be crowed. We stayed till about 3 a.m. just sitting in the family pool, and talking, maybe occassionally taking a lab or two around the pool, very relaxing, the best part of our stay. But, this last time we went the pools were not open 24/7, close them early now I think by 10 or 11 p.m. which if you go to the Theme parks, by the time you get back the pool is now close. Also you need to make a line and get a band on your wrist which doesn't make any sense either, You go there to be able to just enjoy, not stand on line to get a band put on, and on line to get towels. I feel that the changes also changed the mood of the place. It's not a fun place anymore. Don't know if I want to pay all the money to not be able to use pool when we get back from the Theme parks, or late at night when it's calm....Very disappointed our last trip to Gaylord Palms Orlando....Too expensive for families to be able to eat at your hotel. We pay for the dinner Buffet, but grandkids didn't like the food, I think it was French food, which it's not the best for younger and teens. Very disappointed spend a lot, but didn't enjoy it as much. We've stayed at other locations in Orlando, with very good food, and pools open a lot later then Gaylord. Just thought you should know..The place wasn't that clean either, talking about the room it self...the coffee shop was always crowed, slow, and ran out of many items, which meant we had to settle for something different then what we originally wanted. Disappointed, disappointed....It is a nice place, different but expensive, and now with changes it's not better then a Hotel that would cost a lot less.

<Title>“Terrific facility - Poor housekeeping and slow service”
<Content>Wonderful common amenities. To be fair I will note that the hotel was at capacity when we stayed, that said, service was very slow at restaurants and shops. Housekeeping was almost non-existent. I have previously stayed here for a conference and experienced some of the same issues: long lines at the in-house coffee shop and very expensive ( $3.00 for a soda), over-run facilities and slow service. Tip: sodas at the on-floor vending machines are "only" $2.00 and the in-room coffee is just as good as the cafe.

<Title>“They can't cope with the crowds for the exhibitions”
<Content>Stayed for 5 nights over Xmas period Had to move from atrium view to outside view as the entertainment was so loud it felt like they were in the room ( this wouldn't be an issue if you didn't need to sleep before 11pm) Pay a fortune to park and had to queue for 20 minutes to get into the car park because it was the same entrance as the exhibition parking. The valet parking queue were even longer! Would not visit again while they have exhibitions on ( it was ICE show )

<Title>“All things considered this was a wonderful stay.”
<Content>I read the reviews with interest and amazement. My husband, 20 year old son and 4 year old daughter stayed for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. It was crowded, but you would have to expect a crowd if you are in search of snow on Christmas in Florida! Unfortuniately, we made the decision to stay a week before Christmas. Even though we were unable to get reservations on Christmas Day for brunch (lack of planning on our part doesn't consitute bad service on the part of the hotel) we were able dine on the buffet Christmas Eve. We had Christmas Brunch at the Hyatt Grand Cypress and there was such a staunch contrast atmosphere the Gaylord Palms was joyful, warm and friendly and although the Hyatt's food was very good it was very commercial and politially correct holiday dining. Does it really hurt to say Merry Christmas on Christmas Day? The very best part of the stay was the fact that the guests and staff were celebrating Christmas. My family had a wonderful Christmas experience. Although the hotel was clearly busy we liked the expansive temperature controlled atrium that allowed you to stroll with the family without lugging jackets, etc. It was a great opportunity for Florida residents to break out our stylish sweater, boots and scarfs without having to cover them up with jackets! The ICE show was absolutely beautiful and our 4 year old had the opportunity to pay in snow. The Gaylord Palms is a very nice resort and the Florida resident package was unbelievable. It was a great value. Anyone complaining about value for the dollar should have probably stayed home because the clearly couldn't afford to go and clearly don't stay at resorts often. All resorts charge a resort fee (Ritz, Marriot, Four Season, Hyatt, Disney, etc.) so just expect it and be greatful that it was included in the Florida resident price. Anyone who travels often knows that the worst time to check into a hotel is at the regularly scheduled checkin time. We always ask for early checkin to avoid lines or arrive later regardless, but it is essential for travelling during the holidays. Additionally, it is always better to call and speak with the concierge immediately after you make reservations so you can reserve seats for dinner or brunch. This is the main problem with booking through online sources without the involvement of a concierge. You can either deal directly with the hotel or with American Express. American Express will manage and confirm your reservations so there are no surprises when you walk up. Again, it wasn't the hotel's fault that we didn't reserve earlier. It wasn't the hotel's fault that there were a large nuimber of Floridians who wanted to see snow on Christmas and that it was booked to capacity. The hotel was lovely and the staff was accomodating, helpful and friendly. We will be coming back next year , but we will plan in advance.

<Title>“Absolutely awful!”
<Content>December 23 through 27. While I realize the holidays are a busy time, the hotel management failed to plan for the grossly overcrowded conditions at this facility. Check in took over 30 minutes and we did not receive the four adjoining rooms we requested. Our atrium rooms were dusty and unclean and the noise from the atrium was unbelievable. They repeat the same awful floor shows in the atrium many times per night at very high volume so that you are unable to relax in your room until well after 10pm. Even then, there is so little sound insulation that you are awakened many times each night by people screaming and slamming doors both in the hallways and down in the atrium. Although I requested that my room be made up each day the room was only cleaned once during my four day stay. The dust was still thick on the desk and nightstand when I departed. I did not receive any clean towels until the night before my departure. The hotel was woefully understaffed and overcrowded with parking spaces very scarce even though we had to pay an extra fee to park our own cars. I tried to have tea at the onsite coffee house, but was told they ran out. We went for ice cream at the onsite ice cream store, but they had run out of all but two flavors. The food at the restaurants inside the hotel is actually quite good, but horrendously overpriced and the service is terrible. Forget booking the package that includes the Snow! & Ice! Admission--both are a joke and not worth the money at all. The Snow attraction in particular was disappointing with two tiny hills to slide down and a couple of pathetic little patches of snow in which to play. You'd be better off to stay at one of the local chains instead of staying at this dirty, understaffed and overpriced monstrosity.

<Title>“A Customer Service Disaster”
<Content>My family and I stayed at the Garlord Palms with our extended family. We have stayed here before and had a decent stay. The hotel is beautiful with several good places to eat. Our stay this time was a disaster. Not due to the EFFORT of the staff - they try very hard to do a good job. But the fact that the hotel was crowded due to the holidays and woefully understaffed. Examples: 1) The check in process was fine, but probably because we arrived late at night. 2) The room we got was not what was described. We traveled with 3 children and asked for a suite with 2 bathrooms. of course when we arrived at our room there was one bathroom. the front desk staff was able to change our room out - but charged us even though the room was not what we had requested. Side note the suites are not what one would expect for the money. I thought the room was okay until my wife told me what we paid for it. 3) Valet was a nightmare- the valet who took my car when I arrived made it very clear that I should CALL prior to coming down for me car as the hotel was crowded and there could be a wait. Great advice. Except that my repeated calls over the next 2 days to valet went straight to voice mail. I called valet at least 5 times and never got a live person. 4) So I got to valet downstairs and am told I should expect a 10 minute wait. 30 minutes later my car arrived. the valet guys were hustling -clearly there were not enough of them, and the expectation management on wait time was grossly understated. 5) When we checked out, I had a question about my bill. I tried calling the front desk for 10 minutes - no one answered the phone - AT THE FRONT DESK! 6) Several members of our group were charged a valet fee when they did not have cars. They had to wait in line at the front desk for well over 30 minutes to get this resolved - again woefully understaffed. 7) Finally, the snow and ice exhibit is a complete rip off. Overpriced, crowded, and over in 30 minutes. Don't bother. We may try the Gaylord again, but it won't be during the holidays.

<Title>“What a horrible place...”
<Content>From the moment I made reservations at this hotel felt something was not right when they took 15 mins to answer the phone. Went to a trade show and decided to try it out for convenience instead of staying at the Marriot. Room rates were unbelievably high even with the trade show rate. It took us 35 minutes to find the lobby to check in and then another 25 to find where i had left my car (12ish / day parking fees). The signs in the parking lots are horrible if you can even see /find them. Went up to the room exhausted and had to call security to unlock the safe- isn't that housekeepings job? Went downstairs to find something to eat only to come upon an exasperated hostess that did not look us in the eye as she kept saying I'll be right with you, I'll be right with you. The Holiday show was going on in the center courtyard and was very loud. 15 minutes later we were seated and ate a $80.00 dinner that inculuded only one glass of wine not a bottle. Really? $80.00 for a buffet dinner?. I won't even tell you that it wasn't good. Tried one of the hot tubs- not working- no sign to tell us that after we walked from one freakin end of the hotel to the other. Tried another- not working either- no sign on that one either. Finally found one that was 82 degrees on a cool Orlando night (Ammenities fees of 25ish per night) . Tried another resturant the next day for lunch and once we finally got our food- it was ice cold. Didn't see the waiter for quite some time and was starving- so I ate it. He did a wlak by and winked at us and gave us the thumbs up sign(seriously?), but never stopped. When he came back after I was done, I told him it was cold but ate it anyway, he pretended to find someone to tell and he never said anything again. I asked for the check, paid it and left. In the light of day in our bathroom there was something that looked like feces on the wall. The curtains had tears in them and by check out time I had just about had it. I paid my bill and asked to speak to Manager on duty. A young man came out and asked what he could do for me and as I started speaking, he spoke over me. I suggested he LISTEN and then I would be happy to answer any questions. When the hotel sent a survey I filled it out and provided my phone # for more in depth detail. Someon from the hotel called asked a few questions, apologized and then told me when I said that some of the other folks at the trade show had a similar experience, she told me that the trade show folks gave them positive feedback. Amazing- she pretended to care and gave very canned responses, told me she was going to take a night off my bill and sounded like she could care less. I went home and Facebooked my northern family and friends to tell them to never go to any Gaylord Properties- EVER. They are not doing a very good job.

<Title>“Stunning hotel but...”
<Content>Stayed two weekends in a row at the Gaylord. Once with the kids using the $199/night Best of Florida Christmas Package B and once for a nearby convention at a $130/night Expedia rate. The $199 is an absolutely awesome deal if you come with a family (there was 5 of us: 2 adults, 2 kids over 3 and one kid under 3 who gets free entrance to everything). The package includes parking (otherwise $12 plus tax), breakfast buffet ($19.99 plus tax per person), daily resort fee ($17 a day), unlimited entrances to ICE and one entrance to SNOW (a least a $30 value), free hot chocolate after going through ICE ($3 per person) and a picture with Santa or in the ICE exhibit. The lower rate is only a better value if you are on your own or maybe two adults with no plans to go to ICE/SNOW and no interest in a heavy buffet breakfast. PROS: FACILITY: absolutely stunning facility with all the vegetation, waterfalls, canals, Christmas decorations, baby alligators and turtles, shows etc.Better than any Disney Hotels or other local resorts we have tried to date. Very decent video game room although a bit pricey for each game BREAKFAST BUFFET: excellent choices of food. Come hungry and fill up to make your $19.99 plus tax worth it. Did not try dinner or lunch at any of their other restaurants. Hickory Steakhouse sounded very appealing but the minimum of $40 minimum per piece of meat put a stop to that. SWIMMING POOL: big, heated salt water pool with a small fun slide with the kids. It is outdoor though so it will not be very easy to use during colder days. CONS: PARKING is indeed bad. When crowded, they close up additional spots to generate more cash through valet parking causing folks to either go round for ages or park pretty far away. Parking slots also very narrow, only suitable for compact cars really. Saw many SUVs stuck close to each other, forcing drivers to crawl through rear windows! Self parking rates seem to vary by day of the week and purpose of visit. Variations range from $12 to $15 plus tax. ROOMS: the check-in staff has instructions to try placing you in the worst possible room available, especially when you come in at a low rate. That means giving you an "oversized" room on the first floor with view on the parking lot. Got that both times but we did not really care since we only go to the room to sleep. However that can be important for some people and from previous reviews, the atrium view seems pretty nice. Rooms were standard fare, the ones we were in looking ultra modern. Their in-room computer is pretty slow, probably due to the number of users. Even their wifi was rather slow. SHUTTLES: if you think you can use the hotel shuttle to go to Disney, forget it. They are infrequent (every hour or so) and very unreliable. We gave up and decided to drive and park in the Disney Parks ourselves despite the extra cost of parking there. ALLIGATOR FEEDING SHOW: at 6:30pm on select days but really a waste of time, more of a 10mns advertisement to entice you to go to Gatorland (which is not really worth your time either) ICE and SNOW: ICE is interesting to see. It is indeed quite cold to go through and the displays are interesting but the multi-colored ice they use makes you think of plastic by the end of the visit. The ICE slides are OK for a few minutes of fun especially if there are no big lines but that's about it. SNOW is a joke unless you are from the South and never seen snow before or you have very small kids who can get easily amused. CONCLUSION: Would definitely come back with the family if the package offer continues running but may not worth it for 1 or 2 adults or if your main destination is Disney Parks.

<Title>“Outstanding - but - with some disappointments too!!”
<Content>We had a very relaxed, fun, and fantastic time. The atrium view rooms are awesome. Restaurants are extremely expensive - plan to go out for dinner. Our huge disappointment was that I reserved adjoining rooms due to medical reasons and they not only didn't give us adjoinging rooms, but, we were completely at the other end of the floor. We couldn't even sit on the balconies and enjoy each other's company. The clerk was very rude to me and said a "request is not guaranteed". He also wanted to put 2 adults and 2 teenagers in one king sized bed even though I reserved and paid in advance for a room with 2 queen sized beds. He kept saying "a request is not guaranteed". I explained that we refused to put 4 people in 1 bed when we paid for 2 beds. He offered a roll-away bed at no charge. I told him that also was unacceptable. He finally gave us a room with 2 beds, but, the "happy mood" had already been damaged. Parking was horrible. They took part of the parking lot and reserved for valet. We had to drive around and around waiting for someone to leave just so we could park our car (and had to pay $20 to park). All in all though...would definitely go again!!

<Title>“Nice size rooms, mediocre service, bad parking, does not handle LG crowds very well”
<Content>Just spend 2.5 days and saw ICE and Snow shows. Hotel "had more purchase than expected for shows" and had to wait hours in line for will call tickets, to see shows, and rooms to be ready. Self-parking was horrendous. Customer sevice response was mediocre at best dealing with difficult people and situations. Witnessed several employees dealing with crowds and complaints with poor customer service. Kevin was rude at check in. Chris made a nice recovery. Hotel should spend the extra $2 for real shower heads, pave more parking spaces, and take a few lessons from Disney how to handle large influx of crowds. Song performances in atrium were outstanding. Food was excellent. Computers in room were complete waste. Analog would be faster. Would only reocmmend during off-season/low capacity. Stick to Disney properties, Universal, or Hilton properties.

<Title>“Visit for the day & not stay..see only the pretty & avoid the ugly!!!”
<Content>ICE! was bit disappointing. The exhibit was pretty and colorful. But let's just say that the gift shop was bigger than the exhibit itself. Thank goodness that we chose the package that allows us to go back unlimited times. We went late last night. We will go back this morning and take time to appreciate it. BIG PRO: the slides. There are 4 fun ICE slides to choose from. BIG CON: You can literally walk through the entire exhibit in 2 minutes. Expensive $25 per person. For the first time this year, Gaylord Palms added the SNOW! exhibit. For additional $10 after purschasing an ICE! exhibit or $25 purchasing SNOW! by itself, you can spend 40 minutes playing in the snow, tubing, play some carnival games and get to have a snow cone. This was TONS of fun for kids and kids at heart - ME! We purchased the package ($271 + tax) that included: Unlimited ICE! ($25 no re-entry fee otherwise) SNOW! (only one time, $10 combined with ICE or $25 by itself) ICE 2010 ornament Remembrance family picture ($13 if you purchase it without pckg) 1-night stay in a Florida room. Gaylord Palms has a beautiful curb appeal. Inside the atrium is gorgeous. For the holidays, there is a FREE holiday concert tha will put you in the holiday cheer for sure. But the Florida room we stayed in was SOOOOO dated. I've stayed in much less expensive hotels rooms that were better shape than this. They claim that they are in the process of remodeling. I will attach a picture or two that no nice words can describe. For $300+ total per night, I don't care if it included the ICE! & SNOW! exhibits, no one should stay in a "high" class hotel with the room looking like this:(. We will NOT come back to stay!

<Title>“Great place for a convention”
<Content>We stayed at the Gaylord Palms for a recent convention. We were amazed. It is a lovely place. The Atrium is beautiful. The meeting rooms were very nice. The staff was efficient and attentive. They went the extra mile to help us. I loved the room. We had two balconies overlooking the Atrium area. The location is perfect, just a mile from Disney World and Epcot. It is quick to get on the freeway. There are so many stores and places to eat inside the Resort. The food was excellent in each place. Alligators in ponds are a fun attraction. Loved it. The only minor complaint is that it can be a bit noisy in your room from the Atrium.

<Title>“Watch out for added fees.”
<Content>We arrived after midnight for check in but still had to pay "resort" fees for that day. Lots of added fees. For a 2 night stay, we paid over $62 in added fees (beyond taxes already paid). (resort fees, parking fees). Just bake that price in & charge that price, don't have all these hidden fees. Very small rooms, but lovely hotel.

<Title>“My favorite hotel in the entire world!”
<Content>The Gaylord Palms is the nicest, best-looking, most wonderful place I have ever stayed in my entire life, and I am a world traveler. The hotel itself is absolute eye candy, from start to end. Everything looks like it was purchased at a custom, very expensive, furniture shop. The service. The service is absolutely phenomenal. They go out of the way for everything, know the area VERY well (they gave us their honest opinions on a lot), very nice and smart, and personal, they knew my name from just simple questions I had asked days earlier! The location is GREAT! It is minutes from all of the Walt Disney World Theme Parks and only a short cab ride (oh, and all of their cabs are black Lincoln Towncars) to Universal Studios Orlando. The amenities. Ohhh. Amazing. The pool was the perfect temperature and was huge. I literally set my clothes down and the pool staff brought me a chilled towel (great towels), ice cold water with lemon (free of charge), and even folded my clothes! The food at the restaurants is amazing, well worth the price! La Villa Flora (a buffet) has different European-style dishes and courses every night, it is delicious, and the wait staff is the best in the hotel industry. The hotel is very large, but everything looks like something out of a magazine. Everything is so clean that you could literally lick off the floors. Every room has an excellent view. Great things like an empty, good-sized, fridge and a microwave were right in the room. The bathroom is a great, perfect size and has very nice granite countertops and plenty of towels. The soaps are just so fantastic too, the maid even gave us a handful to take home! There are desktop computers, (yes, computers!), in every single room with full Internet access. Free WiFi (and fast too!) This place really couldn't get any better. I recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat. The price is more than worth it. I could go on and on about the hotel, but I can only type so much! The Gaylord Palms in Orlando is the best hotel on Earth!

<Title>“Very Disney like”
<Content>We frequent Orlando often and have anticipated staying here every time we drive by! For starters,the hotel grounds are amazing, the restaurants were quite good (pricey of course, but that's expected), Cantina was our favorite as it was the most kid friendly and most reasonably priced. The pool area was nice and the three themed atriums are definitely a sight to see! HOWEVER, I expected more of the rooms. We stayed in the Key West area which is a great choice if you enjoy live music and seeing other people on vacation rather than conference attendees which are the majority of the clientel. The room itself was rather outdated and did not match the luxurious appeal the hotel represents. We stayed at the Disney French Quarter about six months ago and the room was almost identical!! We got a good deal so we weren't upset however....the allure is gone!

<Title>“A City of it's Own”
<Content>I stayed here for a convention around 9-10 months ago. Although I wouldn't have gone here for leisure at was an excellent place for a conference. The place is absolutely massive and has anything you could possibly want or imagine. I can't even imagine how many people work here but despite it's size the service was excellent. My room was very comfortable and I liked the balcony overlooking the "bio-dome" that encloses the property. The grounds are complete with amazing gardens, clbaby gators, fish, pools, restaurants and shops. Although it's a bit pricy I had a great stay.

<Title>“Nice but expensive”
<Content>I stayed at the Gaylord for four nights in the third week of October for a conference. I had read in previous reviews that some rooms were very noisy so I paid for a room upgrade to Room 7343. The room was large and quiet. The hotel is beautiful and well maintained. It is nowhere near the size of the Opryland Gaylord, and does not have as many dining and shopping options. I did not have a car and there is nowhere to go for food or supplies within walking distance. The Villa Flora buffet was closed the entire time I stayed, so I was kind of stuck with room service and Sunset Sam's - an expensive seafood restaurant in the Key West area of the hotel. The food at Sunset Sam's was OK, but be careful about ordering bottled water ($12) and ask for the price of specials. I had an average tasting scallop appetizer as a special which I unwittingly paid $19 for. Don't order the fish stew. Not worth the price ($29) - it is mostly broth. Stick with sandwiches and other soups. Room service had good burgers and club sandwiches. The shop that sells sandwiches and pastries sold me a "muffin top" that must have been a week old (maybe older). I think I paid $7 for it. There is a sushi place that I did not visit and the Old Hickory Steak House, a Gaylord signature restaurant. I did not eat at Old Hickory in Orlando but have eaten at the one in Nashville - Steaks begin around $50 each, and salads/sides are extra at about $9 each. The safe in the room did not work and though I reported it, the safe was never fixed. You have to ask for soap & shampoo to be refreshed if you are staying longer than one or two nights. The lady who cleaned my room the last two days was really nice. overall, the hotel is nice but come prepared to pay pay pay.

<Title>“Average for a Luxury Resort”
<Content>Gaylord Palms Resort is absolutely stunning. When you walk into the main lobby it is just top notch. Walking through the atrium grounds to your room is beautiful. But then you get into your room. The size of the room is somewhat average size, the decor is okay but again, none of it is over the top making you feel like you are staying in a Luxury resort, rather just a, "eh, it's nice" kind of place. We stayed for our 11th anniversary and did a BOGO night stay in which we were placed in a room that was laden with mismatched furniture and we were directly over one of their indoor restaurants - loud and if we left our doors to our balcony open, (which when you have an atrium view room, you want to keep your doors open) our room smelled like food the entire time we were there. We still paid almost $225 for the two nights and honestly, I've enjoyed staying in a Holiday Inn more for 1/4 of the price. I've stayed at Gaylord prior to this visit and it was very nice, I think we just got a bummer weekend. I would suggest NOT using their specials because I think they have rooms blocked off for those specials and really, they are their not so nice rooms. We will revisit as even the most annoying aspects o this trip did not take away from the beautiful grounds, the nice pools for family and adults and the restaurants - not to mention it's great location and distance to Walt Disney World!

<Title>“very pretty but nothing to eat”
<Content>The staff were great for the most part, the atrium is beautiful, gators interesting, rooms and lobby lovely. BRING A LOT OF FOOD WITH YOU! Villa Flora buffet was a splurge that was worth it, but you can't eat there every meal. There is nowhere to buy even a bite of food that's not ridiculously overpriced. Not a bag of nuts, crackers, NOTHING. The 'coffee shop' looks Starbucks-like, but watch out. A hot dog - $9.50, sandwiches $10 and UP. Fruit and a 'muffin top' (really a small cake) $9.50. Asked for fruit without the 'muffin' and was told it would be the same price. A seafood dinner? $60. Food at the Disney parks is more reasonably priced and with more options. You can walk along the road for a mile to a grocery store, farther for other food options. There is no microwave, but there is a frig. We were there a week for an event, with limited car use, so survived on PB & J, lunchmeat sandwiches and granola bars, all bought at Publix market down the road. Such a lovely place, with nice staff, didn't feel right to have zero options other than being ripped off for each meal.

<Content>We stayed at the Gaylord for 2 nights. The Hotel is BIG and BEAUTIFUL. What we liked about it was the Atrium view from our room. Very pretty. The alligators are just wonderful and the grounds are very clean. My family loved the salt water pool . We had a slight problem at Check in but managment was very appoligetic and sent up a compilmentary bottle of wine and desserts . A nice gesture. The Housekeeping manager also checked back with us the next day to make sure that we were happy.A good follow up.

<Title>“Unique place to stay”
<Content>My husband and I went here for our honeymoon and stayed a week. First the good things: the resort has some awesome atriums that are fun to walk around, some lazy gators and turtles to observe, a few restaurants, clean rooms, nice flat screen tvs, refrigerators, and a computer with internet in the room. the resort is conveniently located close to Disney but not that near anything else really. The place was really not very crowded during the weekdays, mostly just people attending a convention. Most nights we had a hot tub to ourselves. The bad: we reserved a king room but they had NONE available and put us in a room with 2 queens. :-( not ideal on our honeymoon, and I didn't see many other couples there so I can't understand how they would give some business traveler priority over a couple when it comes to a king sized bed. no microwave in the rooms, so that fridge is really only useful for drinks. the computer in the room is awful...very slow and you can only access a few websites. the parking lot is very confusing and if your room is in certain parts of the hotel, you will have to walk a long way from your car. Not to mention they charge you $12 a day to park there, even after you've already paid the $15 a day resort fee! Presumably you are paying the resort fee to have access to the pools and hot tubs and all that stuff, but 3 of the days we were there, the adults only pool was closed for private functions. Business people standing around the pool and not even using it! I don't think it's fair to make me pay a fee to use the pool and then it's closed. If you get a room with an atrium view, you may hear various events going on in the atrium. Over all I was pleased with the actual resort and the rooms, and not as impressed by how they run the place. Definitely not for the budget-minded.

<Title>“Nice amenities but complex is in the middle of nowhere and you can feel stranded without transportation.”
<Content>Excellent for large meeting or conferences. However, if attendees are on limited budgets then they are relegated to the four pricey eating establishments at the hotel/convention center. One might walk to a nearby Publix for a more economic meal. However, there are no sidewalks and the resort area is surrounding by grazing lands. Nice rooms, though. Beds need upgrading. Very clean and attractive!

<Title>“Nice place for a short convention.”
<Content>My husband & I recently stayed here for a conference that he attends annually, though this is the first time it was held here. The facility is beautiful inside and out. When we first checked into our room, it was dirty. Not dirty as in filthy, but dirty as in there were dirty towels laying on the bathroom counter, pocket junk (like plane ticket stubs) on the nightstand, and food sitting on a counter. We went back to the front desk, and because they were booked due to the convention & unable to upgrade our room, they gave us a $75 credit. Needless to say, the lady seemed embarrassed and was very apologetic. The room was spacious, but not decorated as richly as I would expect for a place in that price range. It was nice to have a handful of restaurants onsite, however, they are quite pricey. I know that some people at the conference were alloted only so much money from their companies per day for food, but there was no way their allotments would cover the cost. For this particular conference, breakfast and lunch are included for the attendees, but my husband only ate the breakfast 1 day, and then ordered room service with me the rest of the mornings so he could eat something healthier. There is a restaurant with a breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet, but it's over priced for the quality. We ate at Sunset Sams twice, and the food was delicious. The 2 pools are very nice. They are both salt water, and I appreciated that one was adults only. When I ordered 2 drinks, at the pool I was surprised by the Vegas price tag. We did not have a car, so we didn't have to pay for parking, but it's pretty ridiculous that they charge for parking when the parking lot was probably only 10% full at best. The resort is not within walking distance to anywhere, so take that into consideration, seeing as taxis can get expensive. There are, however, free shuttles to the Disney parks. Overall, I enjoyed our stay, but we didn't pay for most of it, my husband's company did. Even though it's a beautiful place, I don't think I would pay the money myself to stay there, and I think it would be too expensive for people with families. I would recommend asking for a room with a view of an atrium instead of an exterior view. The view from our room was of a parking lot, and right beyond that, cows grazing in a field. The staff was great in all areas of the resort and the facility was well manicured and maintained. Again, it's a beautiful place, but expensive especially since many people travel to Orlando to visit the different theme parks, which are expensive themselves.

<Content>Accommodations were lovely but service was superb. We asked a staff member (who happened to by passing by the pool) how we could change our dinner reservation to a later time slot to be able to see the alligator feeding. She said she didn't have the restaurant's number, but looked it up, called them, and got us a later reservation. If not for her, we would have had to leave the pool and walk all the way to the restaurant to reschedule. The kids pool is the best! Warm water, no chlorine, fun sprinklers and a great slide. Food was good too! My daughter loved it more than her visit to Disney World.

<Title>“Beautiful, quiet hotel with great pool and great service”
<Content>My family and I stayed at this hotel after a 4-night Disney cruise, before heading home. I felt like I was in a mansion when we got to our room. We were comped a free room upgrade, as there weren't any big conventions in the hotel at the time (their target customer). Front desk service was excellent, the hotel itself is beautiful and you could spend an entire day wandering the gardens, restaurants, and pools. They had live alligators in one of the areas, very neat for the kids to see. There was a small, very manicured, mini-golf area between the two pools. Speaking of pools, they have 2, one for kids with a slide and sprayers, and another for adults only. Lots of great spots for taking pictures. Also a good variety of restaurants in the hotel. You don't ever have to leave!

<Content>My husband and I and a group of friends stayed here for my 60th birthday celebration. At check in they gave us a room upgrade in honor of the occasion. Our room was on the top floor in the atrium with a beautiful balcony and a fabulous view. There are so many restaurants at the Gaylord that there is no need to go anywhere else. We loved Sunset Sams so much we ate there two nights. Great bar and entertainment. Loved the all adult pool and hot tub. In short it was a great birthday celebration and we will be going back to celebrate our anniversary!

<Title>“Beautiful Complex, but over priced. Room was average and noisy”
<Content>Stayed here for business. The hotel exterior and entry are Grand and impressive. The complex is interesting, with its many restaurants, shops and landscaped walkways, but I was forever turned around, unable to find a direct route to my destination. The rooms over-priced for the area and furnishings are standard for a better hotel. We had an Atrium room which proved to be very noisy. Activities in the atrium, from staff carting chairs and tables to setup for events, to music and speakers amplified by microphone, echoed in the enclosed atrium. There is no way to shut out the noise. It is annoying and disruptive to sleep, work, watching TV, or resting in your room. We ate all our meals offsite because of the high prices at the onsite restaurants. It is helpful to have a car if you want to eat or shop offsite. I suppose one could walk the 3/4 mile trek to Hwy 192, where there are stores and eateries, and bus service. There are two large swimming pools, an adult pool and a childrens pool. I used the (no children) adult pool the first 3 days. It was closed the next 2 days. Not sure why on the first day, but the second day was for a special event. Pool temp was perfect (about 84 degrees). That means it is comfortable to just walk right in, no need to adjust to the temp. I hate pools that are too cold to enjoy (less than 80 degrees). Neither pool was very busy, so there was ample room to enjoy lounging in the water. Parking at Gaylord is $12 per day for guests, more for visitors. This is too much. We enjoyed a trip to the nearby (less than 3 miles) town of Celebration. There is a nice strolling area with restaurants, shops, benches overlooking a lake, a park, etc.

<Title>“Expensive for the area it is in”
<Content>First off, I was not staying here as part of a convention. The money came out of my family's pocket. The fee for parking is uncalled for. I appreciate that this hotel is not in a congested area, but the requirement to pay $12 for self parking when the hotel is across from an empty field with cows grazing is something I can't justify. The Gaylord Hotel in Texas does not charge this fee based on research. $20 a person for a breakfast buffet and much more than that for dinner. Luckily, we had a car and ate at the many restaurants off 192. Happy hour was a term that did not exist here. The bars charged Manhattan prices no matter what time of day.. Last time I checked, this hotel is not in a urban area that justifies $6 for a beer. Room was very clean. Bed head and foot boards were heavily worn and the TV was the old analog tube type you see at roadside motels. Hopefully, the $16 resort fee and the $13 parking a night will go towards upgrading this for future guests. If you are part of the convention crowd where your company is footing the bill, then the extra charges won't mean much. It is just not for the family demographic. A mid-ranged priced hotel chain with updated rooms that include a breakfast would be a better choice. Atrium was very nice and the understated 'Southern' decor of the hotel was a high point. The extra hotel fees with the high priced food and beverages make this hotel a poor value for families.

This hotel definitely has the "wow" factor. It is impressive in so many ways, from alligator, koi and turtle ponds to waterfalls and an entirely glass ceiling. Restaurants are beautifully appointed with food that won't disappoint-UNTIL THE BILL ARRIVES. All staff I met are top notch and seem to love their job and be very proud of the property. The beautiful, all living gardens with their paths leading to eateries, shops, elevators and more are so breath-taking that you want to stroll leisurely and sit upon one of the many benches just to take it all in. The Cantina Del Sol might be the best option for food since it isn't 44.00 for an entree. We had rented a car so we went off sight for almost all our meals. Location isn't bad as some have suggested IF YOU HAVE A CAR. Each road from the hotel brings you to a close, different shopping area. There is the town of Celebration close by. It is located very close to WDW but I have a terrible sense of direction and found it too easy to get lost constantly! It is important to note that this hotel is FIRST A CONVENTION CENTER and they do indeed cater to that crowd. It is not a deal for families! But again, it is spectacular. Family REUNIONS would be perfect here if you could work with the sales department on meal plans. Also, the renovation for the spa will be completely finished in November. After talking with them at length, I get the feeling this amenity will be superb. Our room was very nice - it was just renovated, BUT our friends room was smaller and had not and they were there three days before us so be sure to ask. Lastly, I found this to indeed be a romantic hotel. It is grand and also very private. Lots of great hidden areas and fantastic photo ops.

<Title>“Wonderful experience”
<Content>This was my family 3rd year staying at the Gaylord Palms resort. We are here with the Tom Joyner Family Reunion ( 5000+ people). The resort is beautiful the staff is great, the food is OK. The package we purchased with Tom Joyner Family Reunion is the only reason we were able to afford to stay here. This resort is so fabalous that is is not necessary to leave for anything. We have 3 children in our group of 9. These kids peferred the pool & game room over Universal Studio.

<Title>“Great stay over the Fourth of July weekend...”
<Content>We took advantage of a promotion of buying one night and get a second night free during your anniversary month. We stayed over the fourth of July weekend and was surprised and delighted to be upgraded from a standard room to a suite at check-in. The room was great and very roomy. We stayed in the St. Augustine area of the resort on the fifth floor with a great view of both the Key West area (from the bedroom balcony) and the St. Augustine area/Castillo de San Marcos replica fort from the other balcony off the hallway. We loved the inside atrium, especially considering the weather outside was a little rainy over the 3 days and hot - beautiful grounds and plants / trees. They have three very distinct areas – Key West, St. Augustine/Old Florida, and the Everglades. The trees, shrubs, and flowers were a sight to see, especially in AC. The gator feeding was pretty cool. It was also cool seeing our name on the big screen in the plaza area celebrating our anniversary. The pool area was great! We used the adult pool which the staff check id to only allow adult guests to use. It made for a very peaceful and quiet pool experience over the three days that we were there. They even have attendants to take drink and food orders poolside. We only ate on the property for Sunday brunch as I had heard it was very good. We enjoyed it very much and it had the best desserts! There are many other dining choices only 5 to 10 minutes from the resort. I understand the food in the other on-site restaurants are good but a bit pricey. Since we drove and had a car, it was no big deal to drive and we enjoyed dinner at Joe’s Crab Shack and Romano’s Marconi Grill the other night. The Sunday brunch was so good and filling (great prime rib and cold peeled shrimp), we didn’t even eat dinner that night. Service was also very good during our stay. We had two issues, one with the self-serve parking and one with the room not being made up one day in a timely fashion. We paid to self-serve park and when swiping our key, the light would turn green but it wouldn't open the gate. The attendant would have to come out and open with a swipe. i was told by several of the attendants that this was a reoccurring problem. When I complained, my parking was camped for the stay which I appreciated. On the second day, we turned on the 'Make Up Room' light at 9am that morning. When returning from the pool at noon, it hadn't been cleaned which wasn't a big deal at that time. I found a housekeeper a few rooms down and asked her to see that our room could be cleaned before we go back from the Sunday brunch. When we arrived back 2 hours later, the room was still not cleaned at which time I called to bring to the attention of housekeeping as my wife and I wanted to take a nap. After waiting 45 more minutes, I went down to the front desk and complained to the manager who got a housekeeper up to the room within 20 minutes and credited our brunch which was not asked for but much appreciated. So while not an issue-free stay, they were dealt with and corrected and actually comped something which was not expected but appreciated.

<Title>“Great Location, OK Room, Lots of Activities"”
<Content>The Gaylord Palm is a huge convention hotel with tons to do- 4-5 restaurants, bars, coffee shop, spa and gym. It is also ideally located near the theme parks. I went down with the wife and kids for an orlando weekend and our family enjoyed our stay overall. The front staff was very nice and even sent us a gift basket in our room. We stayed at the Florida wing of the hotel which is a bit outdated, but the price was quite reasonable and we figured we would be out for most of the time. I hear the rooms are getting upgrades including flat screen TV's. Food at the hotel was very good, but quite expensive. This is to be expected of a large convention hotel. Overall we were very pleased with the hotel and service. I look forward to a trip in the future if they upgrade the rooms

<Content>I loved this hotel! You don't even have to leave the hotel, every thing you need is there. I almost wished we had the kids with us, the family pool looked like a lot of fun. Very close to Disney. The atrium was truly amazing. Nice sized and clean rooms. I found the staff very helpful and courteous.

<Title>“Fantastic, Couldn't have had a better time..Great place to vacation+++++”
<Content>Stayed a week at the Gaylord Palms Resort and enjoyed everyday of our trip. We were upgraded to the Emerald Section with a balcony facing Key West. It was great to go to the elevator and take it right down to the pool. We were looking for place with queen size beds that were comfortable, since most places had double. The beds were excellet and we never slepted so good!!! Staff was very accommodating to our needs. The atrium was great and enjoyed playing the guitar scavanger hunt that the hotel provided. It was only about a half mile to restaurants and stores. Only downfall was paying for parking which was $12 per day. But that wouldn't stop us from visiting this resort again. Another asset was having laundry facilities available to do our laundry especially after a day at the beach. Overall, excellent resort.

<Title>“Awesome resort for kids!”
<Content>We stayed here for a conference, and on the third day my three kids chose to stay at the resort rather than return to Sea World or Disney because they liked the pool area so much. The pool / slide is great. The room was nice. The most exceptional thing, however, was the friendliness of all the staff - from the check in desk to the maids - all of them were friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to greet us and talk to our kids. The atriums were so much fun - we just enjoyed spending time looking at the fish in the Key West atrium and the Everglades Atrium. My kids really enjoyed the fish feeding demonstration at the Key West dock- the young lady who conducted that was knowledgeable and did a great job explaining everything to the kids. She even took us (at the request of my 7-year-old) to watch her feed the baby alligators in the Everglades atrium. The high price of the food didn't bother us b/c the convention provided most of our meals. The morning we checked out, my three kids had to walk around the atriums one last time to say goodbye to all the fish and alligators. They are already asking when can we go back. We will definitely be back!

<Title>“Don't eat at this hotel”
<Content>I attended a meeting and had the lunch buffet provided by the meeting. The food was horrible. Mac and cheese was dried out, bbq sauce brisket was too sweet and too saucy. Rolls were so hard you had to break them into pieces to eat. I went to one of the restaurants to eat and not wanting to spend over $25 for lunch, i had a soft, mushy toasted bagle and coffee. I went at 7 am to the so called Breakfast venue and they didn't have the quiche ready yet. The atrium area was so dark, I was afraid I was going to fall and they were washinh the tiled floor at 7:00 am so not only was it like walking outside at night, it was wet. Don't eat here unless you arte prepared to pay a fortune for bad food. The room was not special and you have to do a lot of walking to get anywhere.

<Title>“Beautiful hotel, great staff!”
<Content>We stayed at the Gaylord for 2 nights for my husbands birthday. When we checked in they upgraded us for free to an atrium room. It ws awesome and overlooked the key west wing. The hotel is huge and we loved walking through the different areas in the atrium. We had drinks on the boat deck in the key west wing and they were awesome. Rooms were nicely decorated, clean and comfy. The little balcony was nice, not big but did the job. It's a resort hotel so we were expecting the extra fees for parking and such. That would be my only complaint about this hotel!

<Title>“Good for conferences”
<Content>The Gaylord Palms is great for conferences that last a couple of days. The banquet staff there is amazing. Although, I think most of the big Orlando area hotels have business conferences down to a science. The restaurants on site will hold you for a couple of days. My coworkers and I were joking because it seemed no matter the restaurant, meals always seemed to come to around $30 plus drinks. As there is nothing in the immediate reach of the facility as others have stated, if you don't have a car, you will get bored after a couple of days. Overall, it's a great place for a conference, but you do get that trapped feeling after a couple of days if you do not have a car. Except for the usual Gaylord atrium, I think I prefer the Swan/Dolphin Hotels for a better overall experience as they are technically on Disney, and you can take buses or water taxis to other areas of Disney and they have a boardwalk that you can go outside and not feel trapped.

<Title>“Amazing and Gigantic”
<Content>This was an absolute shocker for me! The resort is huge with the buildings surrounding an atrium that houses live plants and somewhat of a small village atmosphere with cobble stone walk ways, live plants and trees among rock croppings and themed areas for eating and noshing. It is attached to a conference center which made it incredibly convenient for my trip. I enjoyed great food and shopping without ever leaving the facility. I was able to pick up my hertz rental car for my drive down to Boca Raton on sight which was also an amazing convenience. It looked like a great place for famillies as well with several pools depending on your preference and close to Disney and other attractions make this a great location.

<Title>“Over-the-top conference hotel”
<Content>First and foremost, this is an excellent conference hotel. Those who are not attending events within the hotel or attached conference centre could receive a room of similar quality for a substantially lower price elsewhere in the area. The primary attraction for me was the proximity to the conference centre (and my employer paid for the room - yay!). My wife accompanied me so this review also includes the perspective of someone who did not attend the conference and therefore had more time to explore the hotel amenities. LOCATION: As previously stated, the main reason you would want to be here is for a conference. There is a small town centre containing various fast food outlets, Publix supermarket, and souvenir shops approximately 3/4 mile away. There is no footpath (which we knew before we went, thanks to Google Maps Street View) so pedestrians need to walk along the road verge - there's sort of a faint trodden path from other people like us who walked along it. However, the road beside it is a 3-lane dual carriageway so my wife and I quickly decided that since the traffic along the road is quite light, they could use 2 of the 3 lanes and we'd walk in the lane nearest the verge. We stepped off occasionally when some driver just could not understand the concept of pedestrians (let's face it - there's not many pedestrians in the USA!) and it only took 10-15 mins to walk to town. It was easier during the day, of course, since it's easier to see pedestrians but we walked to town a few times during the week during day and night hours without incident. THERMAL COMFORT: The hotel was definitely air-conditioned. In fact, several of the people at the conference I was at ended up having to go find jumpers and light jackets to wear because it was over-chilled. The resort could definitely stop wasting so much energy and rachet up the thermostat a few degrees without a problem - it would still be lovely and cool without giving people headaches and sore throats from recycled air. The attached conference centre was also an offender in excessive air-conditioning but I think that's an independent issue since they seemed to be run separately. Inside the room, the airconditioning unit was easily controlled, and also located near the hottest part of the room (the window) not pointed at the bed so it was well positioned. It's irritating to have a noisy air con unit blowing directly on you in bed at night but this problem did not exist in our room. ROOMS: We had specifically asked for a room where we could watch the Disney fireworks at night (since my wife would be in the room whilst I was at the conference). That request was granted, so we were on the 8th floor, overlooking the adult pool and could easily see the Epcot fireworks at 9pm without any visual interruption. The Magic Kingdom fireworks at 10pm were slightly obscured due to another resort between the Gaylord and Disney so there was nothing that could prevent that, and the fireworks were launched higher than the buildings in the foreground anyway. It seems the hotel is slowly renovating rooms over time and we had an older style room (since we had a CRT TV, not an LCD flat screen. The TV is located in a cupboard that requires the doors to be wide open to view the TV, thereby blocking the only passage through the room at the foot of the bed. This was a bit frustrating when I was working at the desk and needed something on the other side of the room since I needed to close the TV cupboard (blocking my wife's viewing) just to get past. The most disappointing aspect of the room was the hotel guide is not a book, but instead delivered through the internet-enabled computer. This seems like a good thing - easier to maintain, more environmentally friendly, etc. Unfortunately, the connection speed was dismal and it took up to a minute from clicking a link to viewing the page, and most of the links about hotel services were dead links anyway. The resort really needs to spend more time investing in this service given there's no other way to find the information from within the room. I had internet through the conference so I was glad I didn't have to pay for it through the hotel because that was quite expensive. BED: The bed was extraordinarily high off the ground. We've not encountered any bed like it in any other hotel during our travels. Even I (6'4" tall) felt like I had to climb up into it. It was most puzzling - I can't imagine how shorter folks enjoy the experience. Once in the bed, it was comfortable. An unusual visual element was the bedspread which featured historically attired monkeys. We were in the St Augustine section and even the carpet in the corridors had monkeys playing violins, drums, guitars, etc. It didn't affect the sleep quality in any way (I guess it might if you have a monkey phobia!) and other wings (eg: Key West section) reportedly featured kites and brightly coloured objects instead of monkeys. RESTAURANTS: We did not eat at any of the restaurants within the resort. We seriously considered Villa de Flora which is $30pp buffet on the first night we were there (French themed meals) and the host fortunately offered us the opportunity to view the food first. We quickly saw the quality of the food on offer was substantially below what we were expecting for the price, and seemed to largely consist of casseroles and unappealing desserts. We walked to town and found much more appealing fare in Logan's Roadhouse for half the price. If you want to eat here, obviously check the reviews from those who tasted the food - this is a visual review only. POOLS: There is an adults-only pool (a large rectangular pool, two hot tubs and reclining lounges) and a family pool (water slide, fun play area for toddlers with sprinklers, etc) and the separation seemed to be quite respected. We certainly never saw any kids in the adult pool, though a couple of other adult conference attendees told me they thought the adult pool was boring so went and played with the giant water-squirting octopus with the families because it was more interesting. LAUNDRY: There are a couple of laundry rooms in the hotel, offering self-service washing machines and dryers @ $2.50 per machine. They use 10 x quarters and/or tokens so if you're short on quarters, you can change $1 notes into 4 tokens. Obviously don't take in 3 x $1 notes since they don't give change and you'll waste two tokens. Machines were a good size and clean - no complaints at all. TRANSPORT: My wife does not drive and there are no public buses in the local Lynx bus network that service the Gaylord Palms. However, it is possible to catch the Gaylord shuttle bus to the Disney transportation hub and then catch one of the local buses into town from there. This is obviously not the fastest option - it can take a couple of hours to get from the Gaylord Palms to the northern end of International Drive but if you're not in a hurry and just filling in the day with some shopping, it's cheap ($4.50 for a day pass on the Lynx network). For comparison, one of the many town car / taxis that sit at the Gaylord waiting to take folks places quoted ~$30 to go to the Sheraton Four Points resort (north end of International Drive) so if there's a few of you, the car might be worth it. If you're an individual and time is not an issue, take the shuttle/public bus combo. You could also consider the Gaylord Palms bus @ $16pp which is probably faster than going to Disney first but it has scheduled times anyway so there's less freedom than the public bus system which has more vehicles.

<Title>“Needs a few adjustments”
<Content>For the Gaylords size it is very impressive with every detail, we were there for the AMTC convention for 1 week. First off the convention center was by far the best that I have ever seen and I have travled to many many conventions hotel including RITZ CARLTON in South Beach but the Gaylord has the better edge of the 2. 2 MAJOR PROBLEMS 1. Resturants way over priced, a family of 4 can spend well within $200 2. The lobby AND convention center really really need some fresh air moving through at some point of each day many people that i talked to got some type of headache.

<Title>“Extremely Impressive Hotel Incredible Place To Stay”
<Content>I stayed at the Gaylord Palms for the Blackboard World Conference. This was perhaps one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at for a conference. A definately unique experience. Even though everything was enclosed, you still had the vibe that you were outside. Gators in the middle of the "commons" area were way cool! Everything was close and convenient to what we were doing and the food was OUTSTANDING and creative. I would most certainly recommend this hotel to business and leisure travelers. I was impressed. There were items that were a bit pricey, but ...hey...you are in Orlando...what does one expect?

<Title>“Great for convention, but freezing!”
<Content>First off, the hotel is HUGE. It is directly connected to the convention center, so if you are attending a convention, there is no better place to stay. When we arrived there were no bell men to help with our luggage (4pm??) Check-in was not a problem, however we asked if there was a possibility for an upgrade and were told "no", but the gal checking in a honeymoon couple comp'd a suite for them, and told them to just complete the survey, and to mention her name (the employee's) directly. So I guess it depends on who you get at check-in. I was traveling with my daughter, so there was no way to make up a quick "I'm on my Honeymoon-story" ha. Depending on where your room is located, you can feel like you're outside even when you're not. There is a huge atrium in the middle of the hotel, with a skylight, to make you feel outside. If your room faces the atrium, then you never really see the "real world". Our room had a balcony, overlooking the steakhouse. Our balcony seemed larger than some, and room service could put the table out there, which was a nice touch. Our location to the convention center was great, so for us, that was awesome. There was a family next door with small children, but the walls are fairly thick, so we weren't bothered by family-noise. The TVs are the old box type, and they do not get many channels. The atrium noise can be loud (the waterfall runs all night, and if there is a reception in the atrium, be ready to turn up your TV all night!). The comforter on the beds is nice, however the sheets are horrible! Flat sheets only, so they pull up while you sleep, only to expose your feet to a felt-style blanket covering the mattress. Our housekeeper was lazy, so we had to make our own adjustments each night. The mattresses were firm, but fine. The room was small, but we didn't spend too much time in it, so we were pleased. If you are going to try and sleep someone on the floor air mattress, or on a roll-away, a 2 Queen room will NOT work. When we arrived, the bathroom shower wall had a bundle of "hair" on the tile. I have a photo of it to upload later. Uck. There are 2 sinks, which was very nice. The coffee maker is like any ordinary hotel-coffee-maker, but our housekeeper continually forgot to leave condiments with the new grounds. There is a 24 hour coffee shop located in the atrium. It's nice. There are other shops inside as well, which are nice, too. The restaurant we loved was the buffet! In my opinion, buffets are usually hit or miss. This one was a HIT. Even my picky 13 year old daughter enjoyed the meals. We also ordered to-go items from the downstairs cantina. The Gaylord is not located close to Disney. They do have a bus, however, that runs every 30 minutes to different parks, which we found convenient, but if we were traveling to Orlando to go to Disney World, we would NOT stay here. It is much too far away. The best part about the Gaylord for us was the location to the convention center, and the excellent food. Room service is delivered within 30 minutes, and was always good, except for a "herb-twig" in my daughter's pizza slice one night. They are supposed to remove that from my VISA, we will see. The down-side of the Gaylord is it is FREEZING in there! The room thermostat cannot be adjusted past 72 degrees, so we constantly were cold, slept in sweats, and by the 6th night, my daughter started losing her voice due to a sore throat. The business center is located in the convention center, and I had an item shipped there, but even though I was a guest at the hotel, I had to pay them $3.00 for them to just hand me my item. The rooms each have a computer, and it will connect you to popular internet sites like Facebook, yahoo, etc. But. Ours kept crashing. The free wi-fi was way better on our own laptop we brought from home. Would we stay again? Yes, if we were there for a conference. If not, no.

<Title>“Great Night”
<Content>Had to stay in Orlando one night bevause of my husbands work. Did not want to stay at a Disney resort because of the cost and our kids are older and we wanted more of a adult atmosphere. It was just the two of us and we had a great night. We had fried calamari and blue point oysters at Sunset Sams in the boat. The food was a okay the calamari was wierd it was big strips of calamari, it wasnt bad just wierd. The oysters were small but good. Then we went to the Sushi bar had a shrimp tempura roll it was good. The drinks there were oustanding, diffrent and unique using liquers I have never heard of. Of course had Saki bombs, they were the best I have had. Then we ending the night at the Piano bar had a blast. The bartenders and staff everywhere were outstanding!! So if you want to get away from the tons of kids and have a nice adult evening stay at Gaylord Palms we will refer all of our friends and we will go again!!!

<Title>“The Gaylord Palms has it all”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the Gaylord Palms for a convention, then spent a few extra days for pleasure. (St Agustine, Kennedy Space Center) The emormous Hotel was great and the service was unmatched. We had the Emerald Garden room with a balcony overlooking the huge covered hotel. $$$ Two Pools Miniature Golf Several Restaurants. (reservations highly recommended) Bakery and Coffee Several gift shops If you wanted to you could stay at the Hotel for a week and never leave. Although I throughly enjoyed the stay, I feel that there were some negatives. Valet parking $23 per day Self parking $12 per day Room service breakfast $50 for two (includes a 21% gratutity) Slow in room Internet access (remember dial-up? It's that slow) Some people say that the Gaylord is in no mans land, but I disagree. It is super easy to jump on hwy 4 and go anywhere you need to go. Bring quarters for the toll roads Final words of advise. This is a convention Hotel. If you have a family stay at a family friendly hotel.

<Title>“Not at all what I expected”
<Content>It's hard to get too excited about a convention hotel but from what I saw online the Gaylord looked pretty promising. The ambiance is nice and there is a pretty good selection of things to do, places to eat, etc. on-site so you don't have to venture out unless you want to (which is great after a long day of work). And, for a hotel, the sushi place was pretty darn good. Unfortunately, I found the staff to be less than accomodating. Shirts that I requested to have pressed for meetings the next day were temporarily "lost" and a pair of shoes that I sent to have shined came back with stains on them. I brought this to the attention of the front desk and got nothing more than a "this happens sometimes" type of reaction. I included this feedback in the guest survey after I left and requested to be contacted but did not receive any contact. I sent a letter and nobody responded. Unfortunately, it seems clear to me that nobody at the hotel cares that they ruined a pair of my dress shoes and forced me to have to go to a business meeting in jeans in a polo shirt.

<Title>“I wouldn't go back. Totally out of touch with their guests wants and needs.”
<Content>We booked this trip for our anniversary as this was the hotel we stayed at the night of our wedding. They were also running a special for June anniversaries where you would buy the first night, and get the second free. Sound great so far right? WRONG! We arrived to a huge dentist convention at this hotel. Although this is a very large property, MOST of the hotel lobby, and many of the amenities were closed off for the use of the conventioneers. They had advertised a special message on the TV screen as part of the package. However they misspelled our names (both of them) even though I had sent them an email with both names, and listed our anniversary as the 5th (it was our 7th). We had paid extra for an upgraded room. However our room was missing the robes, and slippers. Additionally we were left a half empty bottle of water (presumably left by the last guest). The bellman sniffed at our request for a robe and slippers. (How dare we ask for something we paid for!). I also asked him to bring up a bottle opener. After several hours and another request the brought me a corkscrew. The valet said our car would be brought around within 20 minutes. However it took over 45 minutes, and we were late for our dinner reservations, and had to scramble to make it to our show (Cirque du Soleil). However this did give us an opportunity to enjoy the company of several dozen drunken dentists, one of which made a very inebriated pass at my wife. When we arrived later in the evening to park at the valet again, they informed us that there was no more room left for valet service, and we were out of luck.They did say they would waive the self parking fees. HA! The next morning we were awoken toWHO WANTS TO MAKE SOME NOISE!! EVERYBODY GIVE IT UP FOR SUNSHINE DENTAL! or whoever the hell sponsored this round of 80s hits, and island music. I guess no dentist convention is complete without a screaming DJ. Remember this was a trip to relax, and unwind. Our rooms were right over the atrium, and we were about blasted out of bed. The next day was fairly unevertful now that the dentists had cleared out. However the alcoholic apothecaries had been replaced with wedding parties. Almost our entire atrium section was reserved for weddings. Practically everywhere I went we heard 'Sir are you with the party'?' or signs marking an area off limits. Enough was enough! I started looking forward to leaving. We are longtime residents of the Orlando area, and we realize the 'tourist' mentality at many of these hotels and restaurants. No, I am not refering to the visitors. I mean the staff! It was ever so obvious here. Their whole attitude seems to be: Do the minimum amount of work possible, collect your customary tip, and repeat. Service is missing from this equation, but it's really not needed since more tourists will inevitably replace the old ones. Brilliant! In closing, once the novelty of the atriums, and the alligators wears thin the lack of attention to detail, and complete disconnect from their guests' wants and needs becomes grating.

<Title>“Trapped in the biosphere”
<Content>Most rooms overlook an interior, glass covered courtyard which reminded me of the habitats you see at the zoo. If you are the spouse of a convention goer, you are trapped there. There is nothing to do but sit at the pool or work out if you don't want to go to Disney World. Even the chairs and benches are uncomfortable and designed to make you move on. I longed to find a window and look out at the real world.

<Title>“Great for a convention but would look elsewhere as a vacation hotel.”
<Content>I stayed here 5 nights for a convention. It is an okay location and is a quaint hotel. I say quaint because I have been to the Gaylord Opry in Nashville TN several times and it is huge in comparison to this one. Here, one does not get lost and yet it retains an excellent inside decor. The staff including. The maids are very friendly. The rooms are also very nice and clean. I really liked the bathroom as the shower was tiled and provided a sit down area. They provided basic shampoo, conditioner and lotion. The carpet was especially nice. I always pay attention to carpet because I determine right away whether I intend on walking on it barefoot. It also has comfortable chairs but not a comfortable bed. It was a little too hard. The pillows were pretty good. At least they were not foam. Wireless was free for those staying at the hotel. They have an in-room computer for one to get on line and view Disney and order room service but my understanding is it can't search anywhere else. My biggest gripe is not really the fault of the hotel but something a traveler should be aware of. When I first checked in, the lady said I had a double bed with an exterior view. I asked if there might be a king room available since I hate two beds in the room. She accommodated me immediately with a king and interior view. Well, I wish I had not asked because the noise that comes from the atrium is ridiculous at times. People are really loud at all hours and they have music playing until 10:00 pm every night. If you are the kind of person that is not bothered by this or does not go to bed until late, then by all means get a beautiful interior view. I on the other hand will never stay in one again. For the first time, I actually liked the coffee from the in room coffee maker. There was a paper delivered most mornings. I ate at two restaurants: Villa De Flora and Sunset Sam’s Fish Camp both of which I reviewed here on tripadvisor. I give thumbs up for Villa and thumbs down (way down) for Sunset Sams. There was a Java Coast which served coffee and sandwiches and salads. I did not try it but wished I had in lieu of Sunset Sams. They have free shuttle service to and from the Disney locations. It is about a 15 minute walk through grass to a strip mall area where they have a pizza place and a Logan’s steakhouse and Publix. They have a very nice general store where one can buy snacks and drinks and souvenirs and such. The convention center is really nice. If you were thinking of having one and need a good location, this might be the place for you! All in all, I liked it but I think I will try some place else next time.

<Title>“An over priced grand facade in a cow pasture! Nothing extra.”
<Content>Relatively clean huge mega hotel with quite average service. Lots of nickle and dime nonsense charges. Imagine paying $12 a night extra for overnight parking while their 'guest'. Not to mention their ridiculous extra resort service fee being tacked on. Altogether around $30 a night in extra fees above what you booked and FOR NOTHING! You could pay another $22 per night to valet park and wait and wait for your car. Beds were intolerably hard. No outside balconies - so if you smoke be prepared to take a hike downstairs at all hours to their designated areas - outside their huge atrium. Staff seemed little interested in service and more interested in tacking on their extras. The hotel is way south of all the action on International Drive, literally surrounded by cow pastures. I've stayed all around the area in about 6 other hotels and felt much better taken care of elsewhere. I found the food service to be quite slow and only average. If you want to spend a lot you could spend the same and be in the middle of all the action to the north. AVOID!

<Title>“It's A Convention Hotel...High Traffic At It's Best”
<Content>The Gaylord is an extremely large and (in many respects) overpriced convention hotel. The fact that you are in an area with nothing close by they pretty much have you trapped. The closest restaurants, shopping, etc is a good 20 minute drive. In general.... *The rooms need to be updated. While the bed was comfortable the TV is late 1990s and, as a result, the quality of the viewing was just not what you would expect for $200/night. *The internet speed was really slow. However, you can't complain since it is free. There were times when the service was flat out down and a call to the front desk didn't help. They said they would "tell someone" but it still took several hours to fix. *All room service comes with a 25% service fee. The pricing was already pretty expensive before the fee. *The one good thing is they do have a 24-hour mini restaurant open on site if you really are craving something. But like everywhere else, pricing is expensive (bottled water was $3, medium coffee $5). *The hotel WiFi doesn't reach beyond the main entrance of the convention center. So, if the convention you are there for doesn't pay for "convention center WiFi" you are out of luck and have to walk back into the hotel. They don't offer individual pricing for WiFi in the convention center. *The on-site workout facility is pretty good....if not a little cramped. They had a good selection of free weights, stationary equipment, trendmills and bikes. What they need to do is give us a little more room...everything was pretty close together. Take out 2 or 3 treadmills and a couple bikes and then there would be plenty of room to move around. The staff though were really good. I never had to wait more than 5 minutes for my car from the valet. They always helped you find your way around (the place is MASSIVE) and they were alwasy polite and efficient when in the restaurants, etc. So, I am giving this place an "average" rating. I can't fault them for pricing their services higher since that is the law of supply-and-demand. What I would hope for is some slightly updated rooms and better internet so that you can actually work efficiently while on-site.

<Title>“just okay”
<Content>as others have noted, the hotel/resort is in the middle of nowhere so a rental car may come in handy. hertz rental desk onsite and thus comes in handy if you did not reserve elsewhere. just make sure to book your reservation a day or couple hours in advance, it appears the cars are brought in from and off site location. a rental car came in handy for a trip to the outlet malls (Premium Outlets and Prime Outlets) and exploring local eateries. rooms are ok. in room safe, mini fridge. according to the note in the room, they are in the process of updating the rooms to give it a more modern and comfortable feel. we did not get one of those rooms. as others have stated a tube tv in a pricey room is shocking and disappointing. general thoughts and comments about the hotel: - expensive eateries and selection was limited - 2 pools (family and adults only), 2 hot tubs near the adult pool, mini golf - nice spa - grounds well maintained and beautiful, still not sure what to make of the baby gators...

<Title>“Amazing!! .... but pricey”
<Content>This hotel is simply amazing. It is massive with an entire indoor atrium. They have live alligators, fish, turtles, and snakes. There are several restaurants to eat at and multiple pools ... including an adult only pool! However, it is really pricey within the hotel. More than any other hotel I have ever stayed at. I expect things to be elevated in price but many things are far more expensive than I was comfortable with. Seeing this place is totally awesome though. I have also stayed at their location in Nashville. I like Opryland more. It feels more real somehow where as the Orlando location feels more fake ... not sure if that makes sense. Either way I would totally recommend this hotel. The structure is awesome. The food is really good.. The service is excellent. Sleeping was a joy. It is close to other attractions.

<Title>“Gorgeous Hotel, great staff, but extreme prices for food and parking!”
<Content>We live not far from this hotel, and our air-conditioning went out. It was Memorial Day weekend and they had great rates. (OR SO WE THOUGHT) Upon our late arrival I asked the concierge which way to our room because the hotel is HUGE! She told us the wrong way to the hotel room and it was 10:45 by the time we took our bags to the room. The rooms are very nice and fresh we enjoyed it So since we were very hungy we started looking for a restaurant. They were all closing at 11:00 so we had no choice but to eat at their Deli. The sandwiches were good but to the tune of $28 for a 2 sandwhiches, chips and a Coke a piece. Highway robbery. The next morning we ate at Villa Del Flora the Italian restaurant and it was out of this world but a bit pricey. We would eat there again, loved it. At check out they charged us an additional $16.00 resort fee and an additional $12.00 per day for parking. They should add that into the fee when they quote you the price per nite, because we didn't know it. There is a lot of walking to do! It is a gorgeous resort, a beachy, resort feeling, but disappointed in the food prices and their menus. We had eaten at the buffett during the mid afternoon and so, we wanted a few drinks to wind down along wih some good chicken wings. Their nightlife isn't much to write home about. The restaurants all close at 11:00 and the only bar there closes at 12:00 We drank a few drinks at the bar which were very good and we loved the bartender, but we needed food. We still wanted chicken wings. They said we could only get them by the pool, or room service, so we ended up ordering room service. Sooo..then , once again, to get what we wanted but we paid the room service charges. I will probably not use this resort again. Disney properties aren't this bad!

<Title>“Great Overpriced Hotel”
<Content>My family joined my husband in Orlando for a conference. This hotel is beautiful! The atrium is amazing for a hotel. You truly feel like you've been removed from the hustle and bustle of daily life and placed in a peaceful, tranquil spot in the Carribbean with no worries. The rooms, while very clean and well-kept, were a little disappointing. For the amount of money paid per night and exotic-looking atrium, you would expect the rooms to be breth-taking as well....nope! A typical hotel-style room. This is definitely a conference-style hotel, as they charge for everything. You can't find a meal there for less than $15 (and that was for a sandwich). If you have a car, Hwy.192 (which is more like a busy city street and not an actual highway) is only a mile away and you can find any and everything you need there. Even if you don't have a car and you're willing to walk, you can walk to many of the restaurants and shoppes on 192 (oh wait, this is America...we don't want to walk ANYWHERE...not even a mile!) There's nightly entertainment on the Key West side in the Camp Fish restaurant. Our kids really enjoyed this - face painting, balloon animals, entertainers on stilts, etc. Would I stay here if I were paying? No, as a matter of fact we checked into a different hotel for a few more days after the conference was over. If you are doing Disney, the Gaylord is only 7 minutes away from the front gates. So it's great if you want to leave the parks and come back for an afternoon nap or dip in the pool.

<Title>“Better Than I Expected for A Huge Hotel”
<Content>Just returned from a convention, so really didn't have overly high expectations. We visit Orlando frequently, staying at Disney hotel or at the nearby Ritz Carlton (my favorite). Honestly, for the price, I think you get a much more luxurious hotel/room for about same price or maybe even less! Agree with ohers on resort and parking fee, although they seem to be the normal lately everywhere. Room was very tastefully decorated and spacious - really nice toiletries! They were larger than normal so no risk running out. Coffe machine and fridge in room. We were in St Augustine section - one of the first rooms off lobby area on first floor. Ask where your room is before you leave check-in as this is a huge hotel and you could be in for a hike. We had great spot - so appreciate staff accomodating us that way. Some rooms definately seem liek they woudl not be good for those sleeping early or woth small kids - as they face inward to atrium with glass doors that likely let in noise. Our room had window only - so security not issue and sound wasn't .. although we were very close to the bus transportation loop. Housekeeping cleaned room but didn't replenish coffe cups or water or soap :( Ate at the KeyWest boat restaurant - service and food good, especially for a late dinner. Also at the nicer Steakhouse - which was not stuffy at all but top-noth service! Amazing cheese cart to select from and delicious steaks...save room and early order for Souflle. lots to see an do insude the hotel for kids with wildlife and ponds/fish. pool may be a hike form your room, as some of the restaurants - very spread out. Overall would recommend but not at $250+ rates ,... try to get a deal and remember add-on fees too.

<Content>I arrived early, was checked right in. The room was large and very clean. Very Modern. Has a do not distrub botton on the wall, and a make up the room botton,for the maid. The T.V. was not a flat screen. As clean as it could be. Very quiet. Only complaint is I found there were not enought lights for me. There were 4. The property was very large and because it takes up 2 corners of property, I kept getting lost. I have lived in Orlando for 20 years,so I found the location confusing. Extra hidden chaarges for resort fee and parking.

I did want to highlight a staff member in particular, Leaford at the Java Café. He is an incredibly friendly and hospitable member of their staff. He definitely lives up to the Gaylord motto. He certainly made the difference in our stay.

<Title>“Caters to the noisy conventioner”
<Content>I am attending a converntion (one of several) at the attached convention site. The hotel is either self contained or isolated, depending on your other needs beyond what they provide, which is a lot. They have the usual annoying required extra resort fee that has been mentioned by others. Why hotels charging $250+ per night think you are going to feel better having another $15 tacked on after the fact rather than folded into the nightly charge is beyond many of us. The singage is poor, perhaps to get you to walk through many of the sales venues that abound. The catered food has been reasonably good and the servers excellent. One of the several conventions hired a rock and roll band, which is set up in the central atrium and has played from 7-10, without an apparent break, loud enough to entertain every guest, whether they want to be or not. My room is as far across the atrium as possible from the band, and I'm guessing its about 60 decibels in my room with the drapes drawn. Thank goodness I'm not trying to edit a minuet on my computer. The front desk seems oblivious to the idea that not all the guests would enjy a rock and roll concert in the atrium. Probably a good place for a company annual sales appreciation destination event, but not for a family with young children or an older couple on a third honeymoon.

<Title>“everything is extra (and expensive)”
<Content>Here for a conference, the mist expensive hotel in a 3-week trip around North America The room is good, aircon and fridge are not noisy (unusually), bed(s) comfortable. But: it's in the middle of nowhere, no free airport shuttle (suggest you take a taxi and avoid the dreadful Mears shuttle), no shuttle into 'town', so you're stuck, with only the outrageously priced eateries (breakfast for $21!). You even have to pay $12.80/day for parking (if you rent a car), Talk about money-grubbing. Internet has the speed of an old dialup line, to print anything you have to take your whole laptop to business centre, TV is out of a museum (but the working ceiling fan is a nice touch). The fake 'resort' concept might work on some but it seems dreadfully tacky to me. Still, if you have to bring kids they'll probably like the pool/s.

<Title>“Not sure what it's trying to be”
<Content>I have to say I'm not a fan of 'resort hotels', but I was here for a conference and had no choice. As a hotel, it was huge. I needed a map to find my room from reception and it took over 10 minutes to get there. Room was very comfortable, and all services are available on their PC terminals in the room. That is a neat idea. Wasnt too impressed with kids running up and down the corridors outside my room at all hours, but I guess if you're on business in a tourist destination, that's to be expected. Not much choice available for food, really, and as I didnt have a car, I was starting to feel trapped in the place after 4 days, even though it has giant gardens and courtyards (all indoor under a giant glass canopy). The food was excellent, bar was a bit pricey, staff were very friendly and helpful but after about 9pm, the whole resort was deserted.

<Content>I have asked for king bed on high floors and got queen beds on second floor. I have arrived late to the conference. All my peers who stayed in other hotels had free shuttles from airport to the hotel. This hotel had only payed shuttle ( 30 USD one way or 40 two ways). When I have asked for shower cup, was told it is reserved for VIP clients. However, when I have went down to reception I was given with no problems. Internet not included and addition fee collected. Parking is not included in the expensive fair. Breakfast is not included as well Hotel is clean and staff is very friendly. Great Garden. However next time I will opt for less expensive hotel with more free services.

<Title>“Reminded us of a Las Vegas Hotel in Orlando.”
<Content>We had a very nice stay at the Gaylord Palms. The grounds of the hotel were extremely well maintained and themed. We did not go to any theme parks but the hotel was at the same off ramp as Walt Disney World. The room overlooked the highway because we wanted to see the fireworks but we never were in our room at the right time. I would suggest getting a room right off the atriums next time, as the rooms with a balcony looked ideal. I loved just watching the fish or alligators swim around in our free time. The staff was friendly and the food at the restaurants were good but expensive. $90/day would not cover breakfast, lunch and dinner. The staff at the front desk was helpful and let us have a room before check in time. The room was clean and nice, although it was not a King bed but we did not wish to wait for Check in time to get a king. The room was nice but I thought the bed was not as comfortable as others. The rooms included a refrigerator for our things. The linens were well maintained. Sometimes the walls were a little thin but overall the the room was quiet. We had a great rate with the convention. This would be a great place to bring young children, as the atriums and pool would keep them entertained.

<Title>“Great! Watch out for hidden fees though”
<Content>This hotel was great. The staff was very friendly. It was my girlfriend and my birthday weekend so we received a free upgrade for that. The views from the room are spectacular and the bars/restaurant are pricey but great. The rooms are very nice and up to date, with very nice designs and very clean. The bathroom was huge with a walk-in shower with a bench in it. The two negatives are that they have hidden fees. They charge you 16 bucks per day for the shuttle, internet access, parking, and 2 free bottles of water... even if you use none of that. The other negative is that this place is a little bit far from all of the attractions, so you have to plan out the bus schedule ahead of time to make sure you have time to fit everything in. Overall I loved it here though and I would defintely go back!

<Title>“What a beautiful place!!!”
<Content>As always....Gaylord Properties are incredibly beautiful!!! Loved this one!! We were there for 7 days, and I never got tired of walking the property!! I only wish the weather had been warmer during our stay!! The kid's pool area looked like it would have been a blast for families with little ones!! I/We enjoyed the restaurants. They are pricey, but, that is par for the course at this type of venue. My favorite, hands down, was Sunset Sam's Fish Camp. Be sure to check out the Fish Feeding sessions in the Key West atrium lagoon on Mondays and Wednesdays. They also have feeding sessions for the alligators (baby gators..) in the St. Augustine Atrium on Tues./Thurs/Sat. Also, go walk through the Everglades Atrium and check out the mini-museum, called Sawgrass Place. The convention center is lovely and easily accessible. The room was very nice and comfortable, with a comfortable bed. Unfortunately, since we are at these places with a corporate group rate, we inevitably get a room on the back side of the hotel overlooking the highway. Overall, we had no complaints. The staff was gracious, and the service was very, very good!! Oh, and there are more places to go off property to eat and shop (Publix) just a minute or two away, and this was apparently not the case a few years ago.

<Title>“Treated like royalty!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Gaylord Palms for our anniversary and from the time we made the reservation people were friendly and accomodating. We had a beautiful and spacious room on the 8th floor. The atrium was amazing. The food at the Old Hickory Steakhouse was delicious. The most impressive part of our stay was the service. We were treated like royalty. My husband wanted to know if they had Escargot at any of the restaurants, which they did not, and one of the hotel managers made sure that we had escargot, which included him going to the store, having the chef at the restaurant prepare it and surprise us at dinner! Now that is top notch service! I must say we enjoyed our anniversary celebration and would recommend the Gaylord Palms to anyone!

<Title>“Nice hotel”
<Content>The hotel is very nice, in fact it seems huge. Unfortunately we only stayed one night. Didn't get to try the mini-golf (with real sand bunkers), swimming pools or any other amenities. The bedrooms are large. We like how the bathroom was split into an area with two sinks and another behind a door with toilet and tub/shower. This was handy with a family of four. We did eat at the H2O restaurant. Food and service was good, although not exceptional. Shopping was actually really good while we were there. The PGA store had quite a few sales. They also have a Disney store, where I believe you can also purchase park passes. We did not take the shuttle bus to any of the WDW parks. This is complementary. The times were not that flexible. Self parking was not really convenient. Inside the hotel central area is gorgeous. Loved the computer by the front desk to check-in and print out our plane boarding passes! Had to pay a resort fee, but it included internet with worked all over the resort. Unfortunately we had kids running down the hall screaming at 07:00. This seemed to go on and off until 09:00, when we all got up. House keeping even came in our room when the "Do Not Disturb" sign was up (weird). This was the only real negative on the hotel.

<Title>“More for less”
<Content>I stayed at the Gaylord in 2006 and my write-up on TripsAdvisor was not very complementary. I had to stay here again but was surprised by the difference a room and room booking makes. In 2006 I paid the full room rate for a conference I was attending and got a lousy room that was very noisy. This time I found a really cheap option on Expedia and got a great room. The room (2003) was in the Everglades section. All the rooms in this section of the hotel are much quieter than the rest. All other areas overlook the busy bars and restaurants and are very noisy, especially when there is a conference in the hotel. So my recommendation is to book thru Expedia / Lastminute etc and specify a room in the Everglades section. My room was right at the end of the corridor so was larger than average and had double aspect, one view over the pool and the other into the Everglades section. Everything else is fairly standard about the hotel. However, the maid doesn't seem to like cleaning the lamp shades in the bathroom, so I wrote CLEAN ME in the dust to see how long it will take for them to notice it. It is also one of the pictures.

<Title>“Not the hotel for people who expect to sleep”
<Content>The Gaylord Palms is a massive hotel with plenty of tacky decor (monkeys printed on the beadspread and carpet- I kid you not). Prices are high and service is bad. I stayed here for a conference and had the noisest room I've ever experienced (and I've stayed in some cheap motels in party towns). The room I was in had a balcony overlooking the atrium. At 9:00 p.m., very loud music was blaring so loudly in the atrium below that I couldn't hear the television in my room, much less concentrate enough to work. I tried calling the front desk to ask for a quieter room, but they had no interest in helping at all. They said the conference group blaring the music had paid for the space, so I had no rescourse and they didn't had a quieter room I could move to. I pointed out that I was paying for my hotel room, but apparently that doesn't mean much if a conference wants to blare "Jesse's Girl" at top volume below your window. Truly awful hotel.

<Title>“Hotel Ammenities are 4 star, Rooms are not”
<Content>I stayed at this resort March 12 - 14th for a short weekend getaway with my husband and 2 year old daughter. When we got there the valet and front desk staff were very nice and professional. We were a little taken aback at the fact that you have to pay $12 for self parking a day or $20 for valet but we didn't let that bother us. The first night we were in Orlando it was raining so we were concerned about how we would keep our daughter entertained but as soon as we entered the hotel we knew it would not be a problem. The inside of a hotel is like a city in itself. There are ponds with fish, alligators relaxing around the hotel, and little cute shops. My daughter was very entertained watching the fish and alligators. That night we ate at the buffet restaurant in the hotel which was great. They had a great assortment of all types of food --definitely worth the money. The room in this resort however is nothing better than staying at a Holiday Inn. The size of the rooms were not large and the bedding in the room was horrible. I honestly felt itchy sleeping in the bed that night. One of the decorative pillows they put on the bed smelled like it hadn't been washed in months. It was a very big turn off. Since the resort amenities were great and staff was nice it was a great experience for us anyway. But everyone has different expectations. Ours was to have a nice, kid friendly enviornment so the bedding issue didn't completely turn us away from this hotel. Although I must say I got this room at $85/night on Hotwire but it ended up being about $120/night when you add on the daily resort fee and parking fees they charge you everyday. The price was still great but if I had to pay the almost $250/night that they normally charge I would be writing a different review right now because those rooms are NOT $250/night rooms.

<Title>“It's okay, but not fantastic”
<Content>This is a very interesting property located a couple of miles from the Disney campus. It's predominent feature is the huge atrium which is a lovely man-made environment including a "lagoon" , a replica of the Castillo de San Marcos, several active water features, restaurants and a shopping "mall". Upon arrival it is hard to not be impressed by the facility. It is really lovely and has that "wow" factor that I'm sure they were looking for in it's creation. The driveway signage is in dire need of change, however, as those arriving at night will have a difficult time seeing the very small arrows that direct you to the hotel entrance. We had an atrium "king" room in the St. Augustine section on the 8th floor. Nice location as it overlooked the entire atrium floor, but getting to it was quite a trek. Would highly recommend getting assistance with luggage unless you have a very easily managed suitcase. With golf clubs, you will definitely want help. Room was nicely appointed with comfortable king bed, media cabinet, desk, chaise-type chair and dual nightstands. Very nice vanity area with double sink and granite counter. Shower and toilet are enclosed in a "cozy" enclave which may be a little hard for claustrophobics to tolerate. I've seen complaints about the linens on other posts, but I couldn't fault them... Conference facilities were very nice and would highly recommend for that use. Our issues were with things that should never be missed in a high-dollar facility such as this..they didn't get us our wake-up call on day one, and did not follow-up on our request to know why the call wasn't made. We also found the concierge department to be somewhat lacking in efficiency- they don't sell attraction tickets and they don't really seem to know how to get places since they look up everything on the computer. It may be that they prefer to refer people to the on-site restaurants. Regarding restaurants, I found it odd that the furnishings in such an expensive venue would look so shabby. Many of the tables have large scuff marks and some chairs have actual gouges where they have been man-handled. The price of the food implies impeccable surroundings and we did not find that to be the case in any of the 3 restaurants we visited. Transport to the Disney campus was very efficient and easy to understand. Daily updates to park closings and appropriate bus changes were readily available. One of the best aspects of the stay. On site restaurants were pretty good, will review separately. Would not recommend an atrium room if you are a light sleeper. Echoing through the night would be a problem. Spa experience was excellent. Had a pedicure and massage. Both technicians were very adept at their task. Did feel that the masseuse was pushing for a tip, which I didn't appreciate as an 18% "gratuity" was added off the top. Nail technician was Liza and very good. Would highly recommend her to anyone. 2 nice pools- it was too cold to use them, but one adult pool and one for kids that looked like lots of fun. Also a fun looking arcade room for kids...probably some adults as well. Did not use the fitness center, but it looks well appointed for a hotel facility. It was seeing consistent use while we were there. This is a good facility for an adult get-away or as a base for a family event, but I wouldn't refer to it as romantic or family oriented. The children we saw were awed by all the waterfalls and fish, but I suspect that attraction would only hold for a short time. If the weather is warm then perhaps the pool would serve well for a distraction. Overall, I like the concept of the facility, but I think it misses the mark for the price paid for lodging here. The restaurants are expensive, the shops charge exhorbitant prices ( 2.50 -4.00 for a 16oz. soft drink, as an example) and there is a "resort fee" charged daily which seems high to me for 2 bottles of water and the shuttle service. That may include internet but I'm not certain...still, $12/day?? I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for a conference or other large business event, but for the average family I think it is overpriced.

<Title>“Kids Delight”
<Content>Our extended family of 8 spent two nights here in the week after Christmas. With two young boys, and days full of theme parks (Universal Studios was their favorite) we were worried about entertaining them in the evenings. The resort took care of that. Just wandering through the grounds, looking at the gators, fish, pirate ship, and other permanent attractions helped alot. The ICE exhibition was interesting but crowded and a bit disappointing, except for the ice slide at the very end; they loved getting into parkas, gloves, etc. for that experience, though. The resort had plenty of kid-friendly food and parents enjoyed it too. Staff service was superb. When we checked in and found our room smelled strongly of smoke (even though it was a non-smoking room), the front desk had our room "sanitized" in our absence and all traces of the odor were gone. Free in-room computer was an unexpected convenience to check email, pull up directions, maps, etc. Our atrium view room on the 7th floor was great, fabulous shower, and quiet enough after 10 pm to sleep with the french doors pulled closed...at other times, the sounds of rushing water, scraping chairs at the restaurants, conversations, and the musical shows being performed for the holidays were intrusive. But we were there for fun, not relaxation, so it added to our experience.

<Title>“Don't stay on lower floors”
<Content>The hotel was good overall, but I got little too no sleep. I had a room on floor two. I am not an earlier sleeper, but after midnight I need it to be quiet. People must have got out of bars or a convention dinner and it was so loud at 2:00 AM that I was awaken by all the loud noise coming from the atrium area. This finally got quiet around 3:00 AM and then at around 6:00 AM I heard more people coming down for breakfast. I should have asked to move but did not want to go through the hassle of packing.

<Title>“The worst stay in my entire life”
<Content>I have stayed in 10 hotels in past 2 weeks. In Gaylord Palms they treated me most terrieble, but most expensive. Rooms are overprices and don´t deserve 4 stars. Hotel has many hidden fees. Most of services are overpriced too ( telephone calls from room ). I have a big issue with this hotel as they made very big pre-authorization on my debit card and I could not use it any more for other payments. I had to call to my VISA center to find out why is my credit card not working and the hotel charged me 71 USD for 5 minutes of international call. They messed my day in Universal Studios too because I couldn´t pay for the ticket. The inside of the hotel is very nice, the swimming pools are nice too, the convention center is good too. But the rooms are not worthy 300 USD !!! Those are clean at least for that money. If you can choose different hotel, do so. I felt very very dissapointed after my stay in Gaylord Palms.

<Title>“Okay for a Convention”
<Content>Stayed here for a conference, and the property is fine for that - plenty of meeting locations, conference center connected to hotel, plenty of restaurants (over-priced of course). Facilities were good with exercise room, flight check-in kiosks, and the unique "natural" pathways inside the hotel. Room was clean and comfortable with in-room coffee and wireless. Free transportation to Disney resorts (I didn't use, but noticed it was available). On the downside, the resort fee is ridiculous, $3 for a bottle of soda is outlandish, and the noise from the interior of the hotel is excessive. Convenient for a conferenced being conducted on-site, other than that I'd look elsewhere.

<Content>Just stayed ay Gaylord Palms Orlando and the resort is awesome the rooms are lacking. The towels were really rough and the beds were hard. Very cheap pillows and very low grade linens. For the price of staying here you would think it would be top notch. The resort fee is 17.00 dollars and 12.00 dollars every time you use your car. Thats self parking. Valet is more than that. I will not be going back there . For the money the Hyatt Grand Cypress Resort or the Omni at Championship Gate .

<Title>“Not worth the money”
<Content>My boyfriend and I recently spent three nights at the Gaylord Palms while in FL for a shuttle launch. My employer had chosen the hotel and negotiated a low rate for our group. Since hotel rooms at the GP typically go for $200 per night, I figured we were in for a treat. The atrium was beautiful and interesting to explore the first night, but once we got over that and returned to our room, it just didn't feel like a $199 per night hotel. We encountered many of the issues others have already mentioned: promised a king bed, but received 2 queens; overpriced restaurants; mysterious housekeeping hours. The room was smaller than I expected and the furnishings and bedding seemed a bit dated - typical hotel bedspread, no flat-screen tv, etc. Two kudos, though. First, the service staff in the shops and restaurants were amazing - couldn't do enough to make sure our needs were met and always served us with a smile or polite conversation! Thank you - you made our stay so much better!! Second, it seemed the hotel's shampoo, conditioner and lotion bottles can be refilled - assuming that's what is intended, it was nice to see a hotel doing something other than sending lots of little plastic bottles to the landfills. Overall, we had a good stay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to stay here again.

<Title>“Overnight Stay”
<Content>I just got back from the Gaylord Palms in Orlando. Stayed the night Saturday because we had plans to go to a Disney park Sunday. I ended up getting a room there for $99 through Bookit. It was the Mystery hotel which I was able to figure out before booking the room. I figured it was worth it because it said it was a 4 1/2 star hotel and the rooms sold for $199 at the lowest up to the $300's. The hotel lobby was very unique, plenty of things to look at and plenty of places to eat/drink. It was pricey but that is to be expected in a hotel. Getting to the room...that is a different story. The room was far from being 4 1/2 stars. I do have to say it was a nice size room however I can tell you that the carpet was not vacuumed properly or even vacuumed at all. There was evidence of it on the carpet! The bed was not made attractively, comforter looks like someone had been laying on it and the decorative pillows were just thrown on the bed. The computer desk was very dusty and there were a few strands of hair on it. The wallpaper was peeling off the bathroom walls. Overall this was more of a 2 1/2 to 3 star room then a 4 1/2 star room. I have stayed at 5 star hotels and this was far from it. If I had paid more then $99 for it I would have been very upset. I cannot see paying over $200 for a room like that. There were however two complimentary bottles of water in the room which was a nice touch.

<Title>“Nice, but lots of hidden fees and all restaurants are expensive”
<Content>Went with my husband to see some old friends while he was going for a business seminar in Jan. One great thing was a friend of mine told me to go to the hotel and use the Budget Rent a Car in Oldtown, Kissimmee, to save money on a rental car (per the info, the taxes are a lot higher at the airport). When I arrived at the Gaylord Palms, I called the Budget in Oldtown (407-396-0928) and they promptly came and picked me up, had the paperwork done in a flash and I was out of there with a resonabley priced rental car (they are very close to the Gaylord Palms). The web site said they had a shuttle from the airport, so assumed it was a free shuttle, but NO!!!!! You had to pay $20 and the shuttle they used was not very friendly or informative and hard to find in the airport. Even with the price of the shuttle I saved money with the rental, and they let me return it at the airport. The rooms were nice and the staff was nice, but only high end restaurants in the resort itself. A car is needed, but more on the extra costs of having a car, later. We had an atrium room on the Everglades side and had no complaints about the noise, but others in the group that had atrium rooms down on the Key West side complained about the noise that kept them awake all night. There was an additional charge for parking and no signage to tell you where to park (I think they really want to push the valet parking, which is even more expensive. And the hired help in the booths in the parking areas were oh so friendly and helpful: I am being extremely sarcastic with that statement.). There was an additional charge everyday (a resort fee) which included internet, 2 bottles of water, and the use of the exercise room. Both of these fees added like $30 to the price of the room and the taxes on hotel rooms in the area are high, too. I can go to the Hampton Inn and get free internet, free parking, and a hot breakfast. Went to the exercise room and the music was so loud each and every time I went that I could hardly hear the TV's with my ear plugs in (I like to listen to the news). If you could find someone to complain to, they would cut the volume down, slightly. The music itself was great, but just way too loud. We ate at the restaurant in the Key West area and the food was great, the service was excellent. There was entertainment and all the people there were having a great time. But it was not inexpensive. Would recommend with the caution not to get an atrium room in the Key West area and to be prepared for the extra fees and only upscale restaurants. In other words, be prepared to spend lots of cash. I think if they got rid of all the extra fees, and were just upfront about what a room cost, then people would be happier.

<Title>“A bit pricey, but we loved it”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here for a convention followed by some R&R. The staff was great, the room was great, and the atrium was very impressive. We had an atrium-view room with a king bed and a small balcony where you can sit out and enjoy the sounds of the waterfalls in the atrium. The atrium is lush with plant life and even has a few alligators from Gatorland that they feed publicly three times a week. We also made use of the onsite spa, getting massages, using the steam room, the sauna, and the very nice showers - highly recommended. The pools and hot tubs are very nice too. It's also about a mile from the Magic Kingdom - a straight, 10 minute drive - very convenient and easy. One downside is cost. As others have stated, the rooms are pricey, they do charge a resort fee (but most resorts do now), charge for parking, and the restaurants there are expensive (e.g., $20 each for breakfast buffet, although it was a very nice one). We had a rental car and choose to drive offsite to an Olive Garden (there are tons of restaurants around there) for a reasonable meal. After 3 days there, we moved to Disney's Yacht Club for a different convention, and then decided to return to the Gaylord Palms for our last 3 nights. So would I stay there again? I already did! So if you're ok with the cost, I highly recommend the Gaylord Palms.

<Title>“Does NOT Deserve 4 Star Rating!”
<Content>My wife and I stayed in November, 2009. I was there on business (conference at the hotel) and my wife came along for some R&R. At check-in we were asked if we would like a room with a King bed or 2 Queen beds. We replied King. We were then told there were no King rooms available and asked if 2 Queens would be ok. This was very frustrating. If they didn't have any Kings then why did they ask our preference, then proceed to ask if 2Q is ok? Did we have a choice and no, it is not ok! The room was ok except the toilet had not been properly cleaned as there was dried pee all over the rim and seat. Housekeeping was horrible. The first day, we turned on the housekeeping service light and had it on the entire day starting at around 8am. My wife came back to the room after a workout to take a shower. She turned the light off since she would be in the shower. A housekeeper was across the hall at the time. Wy wife turned the light back on when she left (about 45min later). We never received housekeeping that day. The next day, my wife called the front desk at 9am to request housekeeping service as she would be out of the room until about 11:30am. She was told that her request would be noted, but they could not guarantee that we would recieve housekeeping by 11:30am. I caught up with my wife on my lunch break only to find out that housekeeping still had not serviced our room. I walked around the hotel and found a housekeeper on our floor and asked her if she would be able to service our room. She agreed and she did an outstanding job. It is absolutely unacceptable to have to find your own housekeeping at a 4 star property! My wife and I were at the adults only pool one afternoon when a staff member came through informing everyone they would have to leave immediately because they were closing the pool for a private function that evening (this was at 3:30pm)!! It is understandable that you would allow your pool area to be reserved for private functions, but would it have been that difficult to post a sign at the pool informing guests? This was annoying and unacceptable for a 4 star property. The only positives we encountered at this property were the concierge and the doorman organizing transportation. Both were very helpful and the transportation service was fantastic. They are the only reason I gave a 2 instead of a 1. I will never consider staying at this property on my own accord and will strongly disuade the conference host from using it again.

<Title>“As always an interesting hotel, but for the rest... eh.”
<Content>We're locals, and this is our second stay at the GP, both for special occasions. Read the other reviews about where this is located, the high room cost, the ridiculous amount of added fees, etc.; I agree with many of the statements there. Our room this time was okay, fairly quiet, and high enough in the atrium not to hear the screaming kids down by the Christmas trees and gators. Decorated for the holidays this is a spectacular sight, and we wanted to make an evening of it - see ICE, have a meal, something to drink and then check out in a leisurely fashion the next morning. All of that was possible, just not as enjoyable as we'd hoped. The hotel really IS attractive, but don't show up hungry. There are darned few food options here (and you're a gazillion miles from any other restaurants, barring the scary section of 192) so you're stuck. They have a fish-boat which we have not tried, an Italian buffet which we tried last time, a high-end steak place, and a sushi restaurant. We went for the sushi. It was attractive, and decent, but (surprise!) very overpriced and quite small portions. We sampled some wine and a souffle at the steak place, which was the best experience of our trip, even if it took half of our food budget. We sat in the bar, which is lovely, even with a table full of people who let their toddler scream and run around (in a bar!) The worst food experience of this trip was breakfast. Clearly, the hotel simply cannot deal with their rooms full, because they failed with room service on all fronts. We decided to indulge, but still have something simple, ordering granola, OJ, coffee and bacon. If they don't have it to you in 30 minutes it is free, so we figured, why not? Well... they missed their window, but we had to argue with the server to get the credit. The worst part of breakfast however was the granola. This is supposed to be a high-end hotel, and they delivered 4 tiny boxes of Post cereal. I almost fell out of my chair. When I see granola on a room service menu, I'm expecting something special, and definitely NOT something still wrapped in cardboard. Come to think of it, the bacon tasted a bit like cardboard, too. Final analysis: Great place to visit and look around. Self-park, walk around, don't come hungry, and don't expect service of any kind at all. I'm giving this a "recommend" rating, based on that analysis.

<Title>“Overly expensive”
<Content>First, read the other reviews regarding price. Yep! Me to! Staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms were nice, but I have been in many more upscale for less money. The resort is in the middle of nowhere! You eat, shopand attend the event all within the resort. Then I travel, I like to get inthe surronding aeras and sample the local fare. I stayed for a conference as a vendor and found out that the room terms for the vendors were significantly more expensive than the attendees. I put that in the sponsoring organization. OVer all an OK experience.

<Title>“Decent stay, but, **** Added fees - Be aware ****”
<Content>There are multiple reviews saying the same thing, so, I wont be too redundant. JUST BE AWARE, when you book the room and you think you got a good deal, guess again. Our example, We booked directly through palms website, got a rate of $152 a night (three night stay from 1/4). NOT clear about additional fees. Here's our bill: 152.00 room charge 21.65 Taxes 16.95 RESORT FEE (for two disani waters, usa today, internet access) 12.84 self parkng 203.44 TOTAL Thats $51 / night extra - another $150 that we weren't expecting. It's an insulting additional amount of money this day and age. Regarding the hotel? It's nice, not great, but nice. I've stayed in a MUCH nicer hampton inn with all the above included for less, full breakfast, big flat screen tv, etc. The atrium area is very cool. There are ok restaurants, obviously expensive. In order to get a morning cup of coffee, I had to walk what felt like a 1/4 mile to the coffee place for a $3 cup of coffee. We are generally not that frugal, but, when it comes to places that hide their unnecessary fees, it gets under my skin. If they would get rid of the resort fee at a minimum, it would solve a lot of issues for customers. I wont stay here again and will be very aware of any of these fees if I ever book a room again.

<Title>“Wow! Expensive!”
<Content>I stayed at the Gaylord Resort Orlando for 4 nights. We were there with a soccer team that was playing at Disney's Wide World of Sports. That is a fabulous hotel. Beautiful on the inside. Rooms were great if you had an inside room overlooking the atrium. Some in our group had other rooms that they said were very small. When you stay at this hotel, get your wallet out and get your walking shoes on. Some nights we had to circle and cirle the parking lots to find a parking spot then it was a good 10 minute+ walk to the front door of the hotel. Then you still had the walk to your room. Restaurants there were very very expensive. I would recomend this hotel only if you have plenty of money and patience.

<Title>“Really how is this 4 stars?”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here while we visited family. Got a great deal on expedia so I thought. The hotel charged us additional $12 a night to park my rental a car and then a $16 resort fee maybe i'm spoiled being from Las Vegas but really. We talked them down to $6 a night for parking but then they still charged us $12 so we had to complain. The rooms were OK, not spectacular but not bad. The maid service was decent even though I had to ask multiple times for shampoo and soaps and such. (1 little bottle does not last a week) From what the front desk told me we were in an upgraded room which makes me wonder how bad a regular room is. The bed was large but not really that comfy. All in all I will never stay here again and will make sure others are aware that it is not a 4 star resort as they claim.

<Title>“The best Christmas holiday ever!”
<Content>My husband, daughter and I spent our Christmas vacation at Gaylord Palms Hotel. From the very start we were welcomed by valet, bellmen and reception desk with friendly efficient service. The hotel is an amazing combination of beautiful plantings and truly spectacular Christmas lighting. We stayed for three nights and wished we didn't have to leave. There were stage shows with wonderful performers each day that we were there including an aerial performance, heart stopping electric guitars and terrific singers. The meals that we ate there were very good, one a breakfast buffet and a late night dinner at the restaurant in the Key West area. Terrific! We live in Florida so we had our own transportation. We took advantage of the town of Celebration, and the many fun things to do in the Orlando area. I had read so many reviews of this hotel that were negative that I was apprehensive but was pleasantly surprised to find the high quality and beauty of our surroundings. Our room was in the Everglades section, so fairly quiet and delightful to sit on the balcony and enjoy the view of the lighted pathways and plantings. In other reviews there were many mentions of the extra costs involved in staying at Gaylord Palms, but you are told about them when you make your reservation so it's important to pay attention to them and take them into consideration when you plan your vacation budget. I hope we can bring our whole family there next Christmas!!! They'd love it.

<Title>“Unbelievably terrible service!!!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed this past weekend, Dec. 26, for one night to celebrate his birthday. We had been to Disney all day and got to the hotel around 11:00pm to check in. Hotel wasn't very busy but we still waited for approximately 45 minutes to be checked in. We were told we would be getting a receipt, in which we didn't. After being checked in, I waite in the lobby for my husband to park our motorcycle. It took him another 45 minutes to find me. He had been instructed where to park and ended up in the back of the hotel in the employee section. He walked through the employee area, in which no one asked him for his ID. There was so security around! We then went to our room and found it disgusting!!! There was someones dirty underwear shoved up under the bathroom sink, hair everywhere, and the shear curtain was severely ripped! We then called and complained to the front desk and they sent a bell boy up to supposedly assist us and bring us new room keys and our receipt that we didn't get earlier. When the bell boy arrived, he just shoved the receipt and keys under the door and took off!! We couldn't believe it!! We called the front desk again and someone walked up and personally took us to our new room. He waited inside our room while we checked it over. We continued to find hair in the bathroom but took it anyways. After the man left our room, I questioned whether or not the sheets were clean. There were stains and we found a hair on the sheets. I was LIVID!! I proceeded to call around to try to find another hotel and everyone was booked!! So at 3:00 am I was so tired that I layed down and slept with all of my clothes on! It was rediculous!!! The next morning, I realized that there was plenty of towels but only 1 washcloth!! WOW!! This was crazy!! I was so glad to be leaving this place!!! The only thing that my husband and I got back was the parking fee that we had paid because he had to walk clear across the other side of the hotel to find me. Parking was rediculous!! We stayed here out of convenence because we were going to see "ICE", which we loved!! I will NEVER stay here again and I paid more than I usually pay for a hotel stay. Also, I felt it was a little shady how the hotel charged additional parking and resort fees, which should've been included in the original price of the hotel. This was a terrible experience!!

<Title>“Anniversary special, no tubs in rooms,triple priced food! Don't go!”
<Content>I booked a anniversary two day package and the experience was not at all what I had hoped for. A major plus for my wife is to have a hot relaxing soak in a tub in our room. Impossible at the GP unless you have two queen beds. The shows were really loud in the rooms and we actually were a upgraded to a quiet suite which of course had no tub. We went to the fitness center to possibly get a warm sauna and steam room and the steam room was not available without a daily charge of $30. This is not the case at most hotels at this level. The hot tubs were not a warm temperature either when we visited all four of them, unusable. The prices at all of the restaurants were totally ridiculous and way over the top for items received. The steakhouse wanted 56 dollars for a 12 ounce dry aged steak and I had a KOBE steak at Emeril's the day before for 35 dollars, In NYC the going rate is 40 dollars. My wife and I had three meals at the hotel and they were each 60-100 without alcohol. This pricing is crazy and exploitive. All in all the total two 41 hour stay costed 589 dollars. This much and we received a night free! The Villa brunch was great, the Sushi was great but at a super premium price. At one point our waitress at Sora the second visit took 40 minutes to deliver three sushi rolls after our appetizer came out in a normal 10 minute time period.The restaurant was not packed as I looked around. Here's more, The shower in the first room leaked water over all the floor, the computers for iconnect were so slow they were basically useless in both rooms. All we wanted was a quiet two day stay with baths, etc...a romantic visit. Capped off by a thirty minute wait for a bell captain at checkout I lugged my bags myself to the car on the way out. A perfect ending to a really disappointing visit. Not to mention a semi-rude valet parking cashier. If i could only turn back time I would have surely chosen another hotel for sure. We live in Orlando and have a lot of meetings for ministry professionals. I must say that believe it or not the embassy suites or the Hampton Inns in town do a much better job, at one third the price. The tub dilemma is a major design flaw. What were they thinking? The double the value food prices are a deciding factor as well. Good luck in getting a lot of repeat business. I won't be back for this type of stay that is for sure. I hope that this direct, honest, evaluation is helpful to you.

<Title>“Not so special”
<Content>We were treated to a stay at this hotel with family. They had made reserations in advance requesting a certain area of the hotel. We arrived and were told the specific rooms were not ready. that's fine we were early and decided to have lunch. I have had lunch at the Fish camp before an dhated it, actually got sick from it. I was with a group and went anyway. First the hostess Jenna from cape Coral was absolutly the rudest hotel employee. She made us wait 20 minutes for a table that was empty when we arrived, she stuck as at a 4 seater instead of the corner area that was larger, she seem to thinkshe held some sort of "power" over us. She really needs to learn how her negative attitude reflects the hotel and the customers. The grilled chicken was terrible, some sort of spice that just doesn't belong. We also ate at the Hckory Smokehouse, service was good, food terrible. I have no problem payin gfor a good meal but the meat was sub par. The breakfast closes at 10:30 but if you have one personn sitting they will let you all in. We didn't and were turned away but others knew to sit and wait for your party. The rooms need a good cleaning, the sheets were getting worn with holes, the view of the tree was great. Those rooms we wanted and waited until 5pm for , never happened. We were put in a room on a high floor that had a great view of the roofs. I like the overall feel of the hotel but I hate the food. The ICE show was nice, I'm told it is smaller then before . I think those tickets prices are too high and probably wouldn't doit again. I think its time to find another hotel in Orlando that maybe has better customer service, not the fake smile stuff and they don't try and help. I'm writing the hotel concerning the hostess with the power problem, as well as maybe getting a new food vendor. Although it's been the same for th elast 3 years. Maybe they would change if they erad these reviews!

<Title>“Beautiful, excellent service, beware the indoor floor show is LOUD!”
<Content>My husband and I took our two small children to see ICE (2 million pounds of ice carved into a really wonderful Winter Wonderland that you walk through) and we stayed at the Gaylord in a room inside the 4.5 acre grounds (almost like being in a terrarium). It was beautifully appointed, the room was comfy, the balcony looked over the inside plants and we could see where the floor show would be. We were so excited - until the show started. It was loud and it went on intermittently with different acts from about 6:30 to 10. We just couldn't relax like we thought we would be able to when we made the reservations. Also, the food was amazingly good - but very expensive. However, if you are staying in a room that costs $350/night, I guess you cannot imagine the food to be cheap. There was a computer that was in the room, but we couldn't get it to the game site that our son likes to play. Valet parking is $20/night. Yikes! Overall, we will go back, it was interesting, lovely and lots of fun, but we will make sure there are no indoor concerts!

<Title>“Anniversary special not so special”
<Content>The Palms promoted their anniversary special (buy one night 2nd night free) emphasizing the Atrium rooms with balcony to enjoy the holiday atmosphere. What we got was a "partial obstruction" to quote the desk clerk, but we got a 3rd fl room over the Haagen Daas shop with a view of a roof. If you went to the balcony, you could look up to the glass ceiling. At the 3rd fl height, we were awaken by the cleanup carts rolling over the brick floors, the last time at 5am. Enhancing the evening was a rude hostess at their buffet. The one that keeps her head down, not acknowledging you until you leave. So we went to the Sunset fish house. It was 30 minutes from ordering until we got our food. The vegetables were knife ready since a fork wouldn't work. My Ahi was totally cold. Expected a raw center, but the outside was refrig cold. Wife's Mahi was rubbery and since we live in Fl we know what good Mahi is. This wasn't. The correction was to move us to an outside room, which is smaller. The restaurant mgr cut 30% off the check. Extremely slow kitchen, 3 dropped plates by the wait staff, and low quality food kinda indicated the B, or C team was working Christmas shifts.

<Title>“Great anniversary stay”
<Content>We stayed at the Gaylor for our anniversary, using their 2 nights for the price of one anniversary package. Upon arrival we were upgraded from the basic room to a suite on the top floor. That treatment alone would have qualified them for "Excellent" in my book... Add to that the beautiful facilities, great people, central location... It was perfect.

<Title>“Huge place,”
<Content>Was impressed when I saw the place at arrival. Huge place! My momentary fascination did not stay too long. It was not easy to find the Front Desk or the actual overnight parking area. Nobody is really telling you where to go, and there are no good signs around either. All they want is to charge you parking but they do not give a service for that . I booked over a booking machine and they did not even mention to me that there is a $ 12/night parking fee. Talked to the manager at the Front Desk and after a long discussion they agreed to not charge me for it. Finding your room is not the easiest task either. They give you a map of the property and of you go, in search of your room. The rooms are ok. Spacious and clean but nothing special. Old fashioned. We looked around the rest of the property. Nice Christmas Decoration and good live band. All in all ok place, but I wouldn't choose to go back there.

The price is ok and the add on fees are pretty standard in Orlando. You pay for everything, no matter what in Orlando. They've got you. Kids will love the place.

<Title>“Good ambience, but left off some important details.”
<Content>I just stayed at the Gaylord Palms for a business conference. The atrium and atmosphere was spectacular. My daughter and husband met up with me there, and the kid's pool was AMAZING. We could have stayed there all day. On the negative side, the bed was not a good quality mattress, and I was never able to get a full night's sleep. Also, I spent about $160 for a 50 minute massage which was less than adequate. I've had plenty of massages, and you expect the spa at a resort of this type to be exceptional. I wouldn't rate it above mediocre. I feel that this hotel met all of my business needs, but would probably stay somewhere else for leisure next time. For the price, I think there are probably more pampering hotels. But the staff here were fantastic!

<Title>“Not for business”
<Content>I stayed here on a business trip. While the hotel rooms are average, the system for the internet access and emails made it very difficult to conduct business. I have a difficult time (have to reboot and reconnect to the internet with my own computer) getting access to the internet. They have a desktop terminal that you have to keep refreshing and it seems like every time it times out I have to reconnect on my laptop, which is not a smooth process. I can not send out emails with attachments either, which has been a problem during this stay. This is going into the holiday season, and perhaps this is not routine, but there is a very load musical presentation several times throughout the day. Its a nice addition to someone staying here that is into that kind of thing, but not conducive to trying to talk on the phone etc. For leisure and families this may be a great place, but if this is a business trip, do yourself a favor and find another facility.

<Title>“A wonderful retreat/oasis from the chaos of the theme parks.”
<Content>As two older travelers (59 and 63) to Disney World , we truly needed a break from the chaos of the theme parks. This hotel was a wonderful retreat. The service was great, and the food in the steakhouse was very good. The interior of the resort includes a lush atrium with several ponds where turtles and crocodiles rest. Although a convention center, the convention crowd was unobtrusive. The shuttle service to Disney World was very accessible, offering almost hourly services to and from the theme parks! The sushi bar was very popular, and, as the World Series was playing, the downstairs sports bar was, as well. We found the piano bar to be a lot of fun. In short, there was plenty of adult fun and retreat at this lovely hotel.

<Title>“Very nice outside and inside, but rooms are just so-so”
<Content>I can only give this property three stars because of the room. The resort itself is super nice and the courtyard is unbelievable. 4.5 acreas of lush landscaping, 5 story tall glass roof. Amazing. But room is a little outdated. For a fancy resort like this, I would expect flat-screen TV on the wall and Egyptian cotton linens. The sheets they have are probably only 200 threads, not soft and silky at all. I would say that resort itself is 5-star, but room can be barely 3-star. So I do not feel the room is great value. P.S. $18 resort fee +$13 parking is not cheap.

<Content>I was lucky enough to be able to accompany my husband on a business trip to the Gaylord Palms Resort. We were thrilled from beginning to end. We pulled up to the magnificent resort and were delighted at the front desk with warm welcomes and friendly personalities from all. The front desk engaged us both in conversation and gave many tips on how I could enjoy the resort while my husband was working. Our room in the Emeral Bay section of the hotel was very clean and whenever we needed anything (toiletries, turn down service, directions) we dialed #88 on our room phone and were connected to friendly staff with all the answers! I explored resturants, the spa, and the pools and truly enjoyed my relaxing few days at this resort. I recommended this hotel to couples, families, business travelers, and soloists.

Made a written report to security personnel. They told me I would be contacted by someone for follow-up but that didn't happen until I contacted them. There was no concern for my well being what-so-ever. I was there from Mon.-Sun., plenty of time for follow-up. Staff were cold and impersonal.

<Title>“Beautiful property, with a few hitches”
<Content>I was attending a conference at this property & my spouse came along for some R & R. The indoor garden atrium was stunning, with full sized palm trees, koi ponds, gator viewing pond, streams, waterfalls and lush vegetation. Our first room overlooked the bar in the Key West area of the property. It was decorated in bright colors, but had a gaudy, not tropical appearance. There was alot of noise from the restaurant & bar, so we requested a different room and were moved to the St. Augustine area. The room was laid out similar to the first room but the decor was much more pleasing. We talked to some people who could not use their balcony as there were 3 wasp nests on it, and others had to be relocated to another room when they discovered a pest infestation in their room. Our room was comfortable and clean. The toiletries were of great quality and ample portions. The temperature controls were easy to use and kept the room at a pleasant temperature. The in-room internet on the computer provided was extremely slow, and it disconnected several times each session. We did notice some room noise from our neighbors, and sounds from the hallways, but the most surprising was the noise from the atrium-facing balcony. We were on an upper level but the music and people noise was constant, however not to a volume that kept us up at night. The meals included with the conference were very good, and we felt we had a good sampling of what type of food could be found at the restaurants on the property. We did not eat at the restaurants at all, except for coffee one morning and lunch on the day of our arrival, also at the coffee shop. We found the menu prices to be a bit high. We did not utilize the pools, fitness center or spa services. The conference facilities were laid out well and very convenient to the hotel property. Overall, we had a nice stay. It was probably a bit out of our price range for a normal vacation, but was comfortable & convenient as we were there to attend the conference.

<Content>I was at this resort for a conference, and could not be more displeased. Don't get me wrong, the grounds are beautiful - but everything else is substandards. The room are old and stuffy, the food on the resort is outrageous - coffee is more expensive than at starbucks! Breakfast is $20 with no a la carte option - and a coffee and a bagel at the shop will cost you almost as much. The shuttle service to Disney is a nice-to-have but inconvenient - runs less than every hour to each specific park. The pools are nice, but the service there also poor. On my last night, for instance, they had taken the chairs out for an event during the day, and then never put them back out! So, nowhere to sit. By the way, you pay an extra $15 "resort fee" for the pool, and that doesn't even include the sauna facilities in the spa - that's an extra $30. Also, the room walls are paper thin - I could hear every work my neighbors wispered. And don't try to complain - customer service is non-existant. I'd be happy with this hotel at up to $100. Even at the reduced event rate ($220), it's not worth it.

<Title>“Beautiful resort -but, needs some fine tuning!”
<Content>The Resort itself was gorgeous. All the grounds were immaculate and room was lovely. My biggest dislikes were that the pool that is child friendly is too small without enough seating. We had to find a spot in the corner to put our towels and things down. We had to wait for someone to get up, so we could take their chairs and then thats just what they were "chairs"-lounge chairs never came available. It was definitely not relaxing and the pool water was very warm and not refreshing at all. The restaurant that we planned to eat at was closed, as it was having its floors refinished. This, we understood but were not told upon check in. We walked across the resort to find that the restaurant was closed. It was very disappointing because my child was very excited to eat on a sailboat inside a building.. Would have been very fun! The resort seemed to be very quiet without much going on-they cancelled the sunset celebration due to that restaurant being closed and once again we were never told. These activities and this restaurant was the reasoning for choosing this particular resort when there are so many to choose from in Kissimmee.. So, we ended up going out of the resort for dinner, came back for ice cream and enjoyed music from a wedding reception that happened to be going on. I would give the resort a try some other time with the hopes that it was just a series of unfortunate events, but I would call to confirm restaurants and activities first! Also-the restaurants were quite pricey within the resort. We paid $13 for a hamburger poolside.

<Title>“Over prizied for an old hotel room”
<Content>Stayed here for a convention, and was quite surprised at how old the hotel room was. I was really expecting more based on the website. They have only 1 choice of pillow. There is a lot of noise transfer from the hallway into the room, so you have to hope that you are not on the same floor as any partiers. The TV is an old cathode ray style, and there is TV available is very basic. Most hotels have much broader range of choices. The wired internet was not functioning when I got there, but they were prompt to fix it. I also had to get the in room safe reset to be able to use it. The bed is OK, but the room is nothing special. The complex is large, and as other have said, if you are attending a convention, leave early. The convention food is OK, but not great. They serve deserts that need a knife to cut the crust on, and of course they have already taken the knife away. After a few days it starts to really feel artificial. Have to admit that I did like not having to go outside in the Florida head and humidity though. Restaurants are OK, but over priced. I can't believe that they tack on a resort fee on top of the room rate. I'm sure that I could buy a couple of bottles of water for less than than, since the signal strength on the wireless internet was quite low on a first floor room. Not a place that I would chose to spend my time and money on for personal travel. I guess that I was lucky, as my room was clean and always made up.

<Title>“Beware if you are heading to Disney”
<Content>Hotel itself is very spacious and has a great ambience BUT do not stay here if you are on a leisure trip and wanting to head over to any of the Disney parks. They have a solo deal with Mears Transport for park transportation who were absolutely hopeless. Buses only come once an hour, two broke down and we had to wait for a replacement. On our return journey from Magic Kingdom, the 10.15pm return shuttle did not show up at all. The other shuttle services smiled sardonically when asked if this happened often. If you hire a car or self drive, you have to pay a $12 daily parking fee and also the same if you drive yourself to the theme parks and park there. Taxis to the airport from GP are a monstrous rip off - for a 20 mile drive, you will pay $58 one way! Being the middle of nowhere you are really at the mercy ot the hotel for everything. Location wise it is just a bad deal for holidaymakers but ok for conference delegates.

<Title>“The Gaylord Palms spoiled me for life!”
<Content>I can not say anything but great things about this hotel. I stayed there as part of the annual Tom Joyner Family Reunion. Thank you staff for exhibiting the best customer service, I've seen in a very long time. The staff was gracious, knowledgeable and helpful. Traveling with my 20+ daughter and my granddaughter and husband, we could have never left the hotel and still had a ball. If you do have to leave this castle, there are many conveniences near by; drugstores, superstores, restaurants, etc. Yet, while at Gaylord it feels like you are in a tropical fantasy land. I've already saving up for next year. Everyone should have a Gaylord experience, you'll come back the better for it.

<Title>“Expensive and not worth it”
<Content>As soon as you make your reservation, the hotel immediately bills your charge account for the first day. Since you have to pay the bill, they in effect use your money for that entire time. They also charge a $15 "resort fee" daily...for items that I feel is their cost of doing business and $12 a day for parking. The hotel public areas are very nice, but the rooms have not been updated. There are still old bedspreads on the beds, though the sheets and blankets are white. The TV is still the old style cathode ray type. Since you are basically not near anything in walking distance, you have to use their restaurants which are expensive. I could find better choices for my money

<Title>“It's like a city!”
<Content>I recently stayed at the Gaylord Palms on business. The hotel is very nice and very impressive. It's like a whole city under glass! The main downfall in a complex of this size, with an all-glass dome is the heat. In the middle of the oppressive summer heat, the air conditioning in the common areas of the hotel under the glass was not sufficient. Walking from one area to another under the dome was a trek because of the size of the hotel, and by the time you got to your destination, you were uncomfortably warm. This becomes an issue especially when this hotel caters to business travelers, who are typically wearing suits and/or jackets during conventions. The restaurants are all very delicious - the sushi is enjoyable as is the steak restaurant. The lobby and common areas of the hotel are very picturesque, so please remember to bring your camera with you throughout the hotel! If you're traveling on business, and you're staying in one of the towers that is farther away from the convention wing, remember to leave at least 10 minutes beforehand as its a long walk...and the elevators are small, very slow and tend to get crowded quickly. My room was on the second floor, and there was no stairway for me to utilize! I asked a staff member if there was a stairway that led me down a flight of stairs, and he sent me on one staircase, which led me outside and did not have a first floor entry door back into the hotel. I went back up the stairs, and the door on the 2nd floor was locked, so I had to go back down, go outside, and walk the perimeter of the hotel to get back in through the front doors! The business center is very expensive - they charged $5 just to hold a package I shipped to myself the day before - it was the standard FedEx medium box, and weighed no more than 3 lbs. All in all, it is a very nice hotel.

<Title>“The Gaylord Palms Orlando was Great!!!”
<Content>Since there are so many reviews of this hotel, i won't bore anyone to death by repeating. I will just point out a couple of things that made our stay great. The jacuzzi's are open/available 24hrs a day. The H2O sports cafe was lively and a convenient place to grab a bite, although it was a bit pricey. There is a separate family pool for kids. A few bad things to be aware of: The hotel adds a resort fee of at least $16 and parking fee of $12 to your bill per day (if you're with a group, see if you can get these fees included). The hotel has wi-fi, but it's not free. Overall, it's a great hotel if you're in town for Disney or to relax.

<Content>This hotel l was okay. I was there for a conference so I can't tell you much. The rooms were nice. The hotel is HUGE and the only bad thing is that it is literally in the middle of no where...on a swamp. Just depends on what you're looking for.

<Title>“Great Hotel - No Mattress Pad on Bed”
<Content>Gaylord Palms is a destination in itself. It is a beautiful hotel and was fun to explore with my wife. The food we had was very good, and the service was great. We also had a corner room that was very spacious and nicely decorated. Our only complaint is that we had a twin mattress pad on a king bed. There was also no pillow protectors on the pillows. This kind've grossed us out, and we expected more from such a nice hotel.

<Title>“Stay here only if you love noise, l-o-n-g walks, & high prices!”
<Content>This hotel looks much better than it is. I was going to Orlando to celebrate my birthday with friends and wanted to stay somewhere special with a spa where I could indulge in some pampering. Jeanette on the reservations line was extremely kind. She wanted me to be "happy on my birthday" and gave me a room rate of $83.40, but there would be another $27.00 a day in resort and parking fees. Making the reservation was the best part of my experience. After I arrived I wasn't happy and there was no pampering. I have wonky knees, but can comfortably walk about a block on level ground. The walk from my car to the reservations desk was almost a block, then another block back to my car. It was another block from self-parking to my room. The room was small and dark. I needed to rest, but the noise from the atrium and the slamming of doors by other guests made that impossible. (The front desk had assured me that the atrium would be quiet and was a prettier view.) I took the elevator down, but the LL button turned out to be lower level, not lobby level. More walking and ended up in kitchen. More walking. In the Atrium there were steps to shops and restaurants, so couldn't get to them. The restaurant I wanted to go to was closed. My knees were now swollen and painful. I had to walk to front desk as room phone audio faded in and out and I couldn't hear person on the other end. The desk clerk offered to move me to another room, but I was too exhausted to pack and move and unpack again. They gave me a $50 credit, which was a good thing, because the entree I ordered from room service was $26.00 +delivery charge+gratuity for a small circle of fish on three skinny stems of broccoli and three quarter-sized potato slices. Yikes! Maybe they could include a magnifiying glass with their orders to make them look bigger :) Also, the audio on the TV cut off and on, there were numerous black hairs (I'm blond) on the bathroom floor, and the toilet seat was wet with what I'm hoping was water condensation. Sleep was elusive due to the aforementioned slamming doors, plus the fridge compressor shook and rattled when it cycled off, and there was activity in the halls until almost 2:30 in the morning. In the morning, a blast of music from the atrium jolted me awake after too few hours of sleep. I cancelled my second night and after calling for a bellman, it took two more calls and 45 minutes for one to show up. And oh, yes....even though the staff knew it was my birthday (it was noted on my reservation) there was not so much as a note, a flower, or a couple of pieces of fruit in my room when I arrived. The best I can say is that the staff were friendly and apologetic.

<Title>“Poor value for this area”
<Content>This property is in the general area of most theme parks and provides transportation. The conference facilities are modern and vary from small to larger rooms. The hotel has pools, a par three golf course that is good for putting practice only. The restaurants and room service are good with the exception of Old Hickory Steakhouse. Skip this $120 bill without drinks and make your way to the Villa Flora instead. Most chain steak houses offer a much better meal and value. One day our room was not serviced. Also, skip the spa. Canyon Ranch's reputation is not up to par here. Once again you are charged Canyon Ranch prices for treatments that are provided by a poorly trained staff.

<Title>“Not up tp par”
<Content>The Gaylord Palms looks wonderful from the outside, the lobby and the atrium, but my room in the St Augustine area was not at all what I expected from a 4 star resort. While the room was large, it was not clean it was dusty and had coffee rings on the furniture. The whole room and bath needed some serious cleaning!!! The phone was so dirty that it was a bit disgusting. The topper was the bathmat ...it had a large stain which left me feeling that I just wanted to leave the place rather than stay for the breakfast room service that I had originally planned. I really expected a room like the Ritz or J W Marriott....no way!!!! I do not feel that I got value for my money and was anxious to leave the property. I had 2 meals at the site. Both were pricey in line with what I expected. The staff were excellent ..professional and courteous. The extra charge for parking and resort fee ver over the top...I will go back to the Peabody the next time I visit Orlando.

<Title>“Nice place for a conference -”
<Content>Spent 4 nights at the Gaylord Palms for a Health care related meeting. The hotel is beautiful! and the rooms ( Emerald Isle ) are appointed very nicely. The free internet service is a plus. The attached conference center is connected to the hotel. All personnel was very helpful and assisted appropriately. The pool (s) are large. There are 3. Overall, the Gaylord Palms is a very nice hotel for either a conference or a family vacation Food at the conference was ok - there were 3000 of us - so I am taking that into consideration. There is a free shuttle to all Disney attractions from the Hotel.

<Title>“Published Rates Don't Apply”
<Content>I've stayed at the Gaylord several times in the past and it is a unique and beautiful property. What food I've had there was good, but extremely over-priced, particularly at the Steak House where everything is very expensive and is a la carte. The pools are beautiful, but the workout room is just average and certainly not worth the mandatory $15.00 "resort fee" charged to the room daily. Then there is the exorbitant $12.00 a day self parking fee which many reviewers have mentioned. I suggest that you take a walk through the resort to see it, stop at one of the resturants and order an appetizer to get your parking ticket validated and stay somewhere else. The additional $27.00 per day in fees render the advertised room rates meaningless. I would reccomend this property to someone as long as money is no object.

<Title>“Nice Conference Resort, Expensive Leisure Destination”
<Content>Attended a conference at Gaylord Palms in late July. Stayed 3 nights. Resort is located in Kissimmee, about 10-15 minutes from Walt Disney World (WDW) parks. It is a stand-alone resort NOT within walking distance of any place therefore you may want to have a car. They do offer (I believe free) shuttle to WDW parks but not elsewhere. Check-in was quick and easy. Staff at the resort was very friendly, from check-in to housekeeping to concierge. Resort Amenities Like other Gaylord complexes, this is a massive conglomeration of hotel rooms, shops, bars and restaurants under one roof, with a conference center attached. Everything is accessible without having to go outside in the FL heat. Atrium is very nice. There are two big outdoor pools, one geared towards kids. There are several restaurants, ice cream shop, spa and exercise facility, all under the one glass roof. So you do not need to leave the resort, if so inclined, although most people probably do not go to Orlando just to stay at their hotel. Parking is $12 a day. There is also a mandatory Resort Fee of $15 a day--this gets you 2 bottles of water a day, privilege to use the workout area, and “free” Internet access in the room and common areas (but NOT at the conference center). Spa and restaurants are VERY expensive. Accommodation Each section of the resort has a theme. Décor in the rooms are nice but not extraordinary. Everything was in working order and the room was clean and roomy. Reasonably well insulated from noise. Bed was comfortable. There is a mini-refrigerator and single-serve coffee maker. Wi-Fi speed was good in the rooms, spotty in the common areas. Summary Nice resort if someone else is paying for it. Our conference rate was $169/night. But by the time you add in all the fees and taxes, it was about $230/night. If you can get a reasonable rate, and have a car to go elsewhere to eat, this is a nice place to stay. Otherwise budget accordingly.

<Title>“huge hotel, beautiful atrium, lots to do, but pricey”
<Content>We visited for a convention in July, this is a huge hotel, a place we never would have been able to stay if someone else wasn't payingt! The atrium was beautiful, a nice walk through all kinds of flora, & alligators, turtles & koi all swimming around. It was also nice to have an adult pool, where kids weren't running around all day. I never made it to the kids pool, but it looked like it would be a lot of fun. There were also several hot tubs to enjoy, & they were never full, so you could always find one. There was a bocce ball court & putt putt course, which were included & nice to use. It bugs me, though, that you would have to pay a $12 fee each day to park there. I mean, you're already shelling out for a room, why on earth would I have to pay to park? It's not downtown anywhere, there is a huge lot with plenty of parking. One other thing I have to fault them on is the room service. We were only there for 4 nights, but our sheets never got changed, the bed was barely made up, & the bathroom wasn't cleaned as well as I would have expected the whole time we were there. For the $$ dished out for this room, I expected a little more as far as housekeeping goes. All in all, we had a wonderful stay, but there is no way I'd pay the money to stay there myself.

<Title>“Beautiful resort - but misses on the details”
<Content>The Gaylord Palms is a beautiful resort where you could have a great vacation and never leave the property. But there are some things to be aware of that are not consistent with what you may expect from a hotel of this caliber. I expect the best from a four and a half star resort, and we got a solid experience, but it failed to meet my high expectations. We started off with a $12 per day fee to park our car ($20 for valet). I am a bit frustrated, but whatever, I am on vacation. Then we check in with some seriously friendly staff, who inform us of the $16.95 per day per room "resort fee"....huh? Resort fee? It is a fee to use the gym, pool, hot tub, atriums, etc. We won't use these then.....which is when they tell us the fee is not optional. You pay whether you use the amenities or not. Nice! We pass a plate of chicken wings on the floor as we get to our 5th floor room in the St. Augustine wing of the hotel. No biggie....someone had an afternoon snack. Problem is they were still on the floor when we left three days later! The room itself was nice, with a big king bed and a great view from two walls with floor to ceiling windows as we had a corner room. It also had a nice tile shower with a bench seat. My wife loved this feature for shaving her legs.... I was a bit miffed by the spots of mildew in the corner of the shower floor and the edge of the seat. But again, no big deal, we all have some mildew in our showers right? The atriums were gorgeous, like being in a indoor botanical garden. The fitness center has top-notch equipment and was great for a morning workout. The Adults only pool would have been at home on South Beach. The kids pool could have been a corner of a water park just for kids. It had a cartoon-esque dragon fountain and waterslide combo with a waterfall....looked amazing. Ultimately the hotel was beautiful. I would not recommend eating on the property if you do not have seriously deep pockets. A couple of burgers, fries and cokes might be $10-12 bucks at McDonalds, but the poolside Cafe here ran $40. I was shocked. Room service was pricey too at $20 for eggs and oatmeal. I want to be clear, the resort is beautiful and a great place for a romantic getaway or a family vacation as it is close to Disney and has a free shuttle to the park. It just misses on the fine points that turn a mediocre resort into a great one. Positives: Great Adults Only Pool Amazing Family Pool Fantastic Workout Facilities Gorgeous Design – Amazing Building Nice tile shower with bench seat Negatives: Attention to detail and Hotel Up-keep Hotel Restaurants and Room Service Ridiculously Over-Priced Mismatched Room Furniture A touch of mildew in the shower

<Title>“One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at and next door to Disney, I-Drive, I-4..the only drawback is very pricey food”
<Content>This is one of the most interesting resorts I've ever stayed at, and I really have only one real complaint. The rooms facing the inside overlook the most amazing hotel atrium I've ever seen, all Florida themed. Mini replica of an old St. Augustine fort (which would make an awesome wedding stage), man-made nature walk over Everglades-like streams with lush vegetation and even small alligators basking on rocks! Koi ponds, turtles, etc.. But this is no tacky tourist trap - this is all done very tastefully and it really feels natural. There is also a sort of "Main Street" area with high-end shops. This atrium-shop area would also make a great wedding backdrop (they even have wedding cakes on display in one of the shop windows). The hotel rooms are divided into different sections based on Florida theme. The main two sections seem to be Key West and St. Augustine (I think there's also a section called Emerald Bay, but I can't remember). The St. Augustine section seems to be more upper-end simply because of where they are situated over the atrium. The rooms look over the old fort/natural everglades area. We stayed in the Key West section, but decided if we ever came back we'd stay in the St. Augustine section simply to try something different and listen to the waterfalls. That brings me to one point to consider - If you stay in the Key West section and overlook the amazing atrium, you will hear live music until about 10:00 or so. If you are an early sleeper, you may want to stay in the St. Augustine section and hear the small waterfalls in the Everglades themed atrium. With the doors shut, however, the musical noise wasn't bad at all. The Key West section was over one of the restaurants called Sunset Sam's Fish Camp which was Key West themed with a ballooon maker on stilts and a "pirate" who did balancing tricks with a knife and other objects making the rounds between tables. If you have children, make dinner reservations at Sunst Sam's, this is the most kid friendly restaurant inside the atrium. There are two pools, one for adults and one for children/adults which has a cool waterslide. This pool seems to be heated and feels just like bathwater! There is a sports bar/restaurant next to the kids pool called H2O, and though the food is good the atmosphere is noisy inside. My suggestion is if the weather is not too hot sit outside and enjoy the pool scene while eating at H2O. Speaking of restaurants, the price of food is my only complaint. Other posters have said it before, and it's true. The food price is sky high. The Old Hickory Steakhouse is not for families on a budget. Everything is a la carte and the steaks alone are around $40 and up. Add sides, dessert and drinks and you alone could easily pay over $100 just for one person! Sunset Sam's and H2O would be the choice for budget minded people, but even these places aren't real cheap. The breakfast buffet at Villa De Flora was awesome - and it was "only" about $21 per person. Our young daughter was free, however. If you want a great breakfast buffet, this is the place to eat. It lets the kids pick what they want and it's fast. This hotel is also really geared towards conventions. Huge convention areas and many rooms for get togethers big and small. From major drug companies to a small family reunion, they were all there during our stay enjoying this awesome place. Big group or small group, this would be a great place to gather. Besides the sky high price of food, everything else about the place was perfect. I would stay there again for sure, and would recommend it to anyone. It's right next door to Disney World, International Drive, I-4, etc... etc.... location would be hard to beat.

<Title>“Overpriced, rude staff”
<Content>Was in for a business meeting and trade show. Found the food and parking over priced. One night we tried to leave the parking lot and because so many cards were leaving at the came time (the show just ended) it took 45 minutes just to get out of the parking lot. All parking is paid for ($12.84 a day, NO in and out either!). They took so long to collect money this is what the hold up was! If they really carred about their guests they would have waved people through rather than make us wait 45 minutes in 95 degree temperatures because $12 was more important than their guests. I don't mind paying for service but do object to getting ripped off.

<Title>“Loved being outside inside!”
<Content>My self and my husband were staying in a pool villa in Davenport recently. Because of a few days of cloud and rain, having done all the shopping that we could possibly carry back to the UK, and, having done the theme parks on numerous trips before, decided to spend a night at the hotel with the rather strange name that we had driven past many times! We booked a king room with atrium view and i must say what a delight! It was a rather strange but wonderful experience, opening the french doors on to a balcony and looking outside whilst still being inside!!! From the rather exotic plants and fish, to the aligators, turtles and general outdoor feel, it was quite lovely. We ate at the Villa De Flora buffet restaurant and found it to have a nice relaxing romantic atmosphere. Price wise, to be honest, maybe coming from the UK where we have to pay through the nose for everything, we found it to be quite reasonable. All in all, it was a memorable time for us and we would love to do it again sometime.

<Title>“Gaylord Palms restaurants outrageous!”
<Content>We found ourselves totally isolated at the Gaylord Palms. 2 small grilled sandwiches, a small boxed salad, a coke & 2 beers at the outside coffee shop cost $45! at night in the sports bar 2 sandwiches, a hamburger, 2 cokes & 4 beers cost $81.00 plus tip! we asked the front desk where we could buy food and they were very evasive. we finally got them to tell us that there was a store called Publix 1/4 mile away. we are older and my husband can't walk far, we had to take the hotel towncar - they won't call a taxi - and it cost $10 each way. at least the driver didn't charge us another ten or twenty for "waiting"!. their website says there are shuttles to disneyworld every 30 minutes but after waiting 45 min. in the transportation area, we went to the concierge desk & were told their schedule changed in Jan. & it is every hour to hour & a half depending on time of day. on the phone we were told that the Magic Kingdom is only 12 - 15 minutes from the hotel. what they DIDN'T tell us was their hotel "shuttle bus" stops at every disney park on the way & magic kingdom is last - so their trip is one hour. their "town car" service charges $25.00, which we begrudgingly took because we had already waited so long for the bus! the room: we paid extra for the Emerald Bay room & when we checked in, their long list of amenities was not in the room. i called the front desk and was told they "no longer" put the robes & slippers in the rooms unless the guests call down & asked for them. also no balcony-so we asked to change rooms. they didn't help us change, & my grandson left a pair of shoes in the room. instead of bringing them to us, they just sent them to lost & found & when we discovered they were missing, it took 45 minutes to locate them. overall, we won't come back here. if you come, bring lots of snacks & rent a car!

<Title>“Exceptional Resort Just Missing the Mark”
<Content>My wife and I, along with some extened family, stayed at the Gaylord Palms Resort for seven days in June 2009. While much of the resort was buzzing due to a large "tool dealer" expo, we were in Kissimmee to spend the week at the Disney parks nearby. The Gaylord Palms is truly a breathtaking example of human ingenuity and creativity. Most of the nine story resort is centered around an atrium that fills with sunlight as the sun beams through the glass rooftop in the morning. The atrium contains countless native floridian plants that landscapers have done an incredible job designing, along with numerous ponds and creeks that contain many species of fish. Making this a truly unique resort, there is a pond that houses aligators who can be found sunning themselves most of the day. From our atrium view room on the ninth floor of the St. Augustine section of the hotel, we truly enjoyed everything that the Gaylord Palms had put together. Even though we did enjoy the resort, there were some shortcomings which I will explain in detail below. Positives: 1. We had a room containing two beds which easily housed four adults. The room was very modern (although they could upgrade to flat screen TVs in the room), and was always kept nicely by the housekeeper. If you are a family of 5+ people, it might be a bit tight, and the hotel charges a whoping $30 a night for a rollaway bed, so plan accordingly. 2. Vicinity to Disney Parks. The Gaylord is literally within a mile of Disney property, thus making it a desireable place to stay if you'll be spending time at the parks. The hotel offers a free shuttle to the parks, which helps if you're looking to avoid parking fees at Disney. Be on time for the shuttle, because they leave exactly on time, down to the minute. 3. Family Friendliness. If you are simply looking for a place to bring the family for a weekend, Gaylord Palms would be awesome. They have a very cool kid's "water park" area that kids seemed to really enjoy. I think the kids would be entertained solely at the hotel for at least a couple days or weekend. There is also an adults only pool if you are looking for some solace by yourself. Negatives: 1. Overall cost. We booked this hotel through hotwire, assuming this would be a great deal for us, but the extra mandatory costs added an extra 25%. Parking alone is $13 per day, with in/out access. The Gaylord is not in a dense urban setting, so simply charging for parking does not make sense. The resort also charges a $17 mandatory "resort fee", which includes two measly bottles of water, internet access, and use of facilities that normally are included with every other hotel. Between these two costs, it added a significant amount to my bill upon checkout, so budget accordingly. 2. Staffing. I understand that less people are traveling during the economic downtun, but there wasn't enough staff to cover all areas of the hotel. Specifically, room service carts were routinely left in the hallway almost 24 hours to the point where the food was beginning to smell quite a bit. I don't think this issue will affect most of your stay, but it was something I did notice over the course of the week. 3. Did I mention the parking and resort fee? 4. Cost of food. If you are on a budget, bring your food with you or plan to go out. The restaurants inside the hotel average a whopping $30 per entree (yikes!). Overall, we really did enjoy our stay at the Gaylord Palms; a very unique and classy hotel.

<Title>“AMAZING!!! Great place for conferences.”
<Content>This place has everything you can possibly want. Be careful bc you will get lost. So know which rooms you are going to before your appointments. There is a free shuttle to the Disney Parks and Universal. The restaurants are abit overpriced. The bar downstairs is pretty cool. Great place for a conference. Many rooms and banquet halls. A good place to go back for a work function. Not good for a family. Its MASSIVE. There are two different swimming pools. You never have to leave the hotel if you didnt want to.

<Title>“Mostly Good and Some Bad”
<Content>We live in Central FL and just returned from a weekend trip to the Gaylord Palms with our 2 children - 18mos and 2mos. Let me preface the review by saying that I am not a cheapskate, but I am always looking at getting the most for my money. I booked the hotel through Hotwire for around $96/night before taxes and fees. Which isn't bad considering that the lowest prices elsewhere was $205/night for the same weekend. The Good: Everywhere we went, from check-in to check-out, the staff was extremely nice with the exception of one - which is explained in "The Bad". I asked for a King Bed, and was accommodated without hesitation. For a $10 tip at check-in, I was also able to score a room with a balcony overlooking the atrium. We forgot to pack milk for our toddler, and the wait-staff was more than happy to give us a couple extra pints of milk for the room. My wife and I thought the hotel was absolutely beautiful. You are definitely paying for the the spectacular atrium and lush landscaping indoors and out. For what we paid, I felt like we got our money's worth. The room was well appointed, with nice furniture and the bed was comfortable. Local calls are free (20 minute time limit) which is convenient. The in-room computer was nice to have, but as others have stated, the Internet was very slow. It was a nice way to learn about the hotel and make reservations. Also, you can view the menu of every restaurant in the hotel, including prices - which was great so you know what to expect. We sleep with a sound-machine so I wasn't worried about potential noise from the atrium. We were on the 5th floor above the tower of the Castle, and even without the sound-machine, the noise was very tolerable in my opinion. Mostly all we heard was a light jazz music being played, and an occasional outburst of laughter from someone in the bar below. This may depend on where your room is however and/or how busy the hotel is, as well as your sensitivity to those things. We felt it the view was worth it. The Bad Food was EXPENSIVE. I wanted to go the the Old Hickory Steakhouse, but when I went online and saw the prices ($35 and up - not including any salads/sides), we decided to try Sunset Sam's Fish Camp. The food there was just OK, yet still pricey ($25 and up). We ordered 1 mixed dink, a soda, a cup of milk, 1 cup of bisque, a sea-scallop dinner, a seafood pasta dinner, and 2 shot-glasses (literally) filled with creme-brule for dessert ran us $87 plus tip. To top it off, this was the only bad service we received in the hotel was at that restaurant. The older waitress that we got was not very helpful, and seemed to be rushing us into decisions, and it felt like she was just trying to get us out of there. In hindsight, we probably should have bitten the bullet and gone to the steakhouse, for a little more money we may have enjoyed it more. The next morning we ate breakfast at the buffet restaurant Villa de Flora. After spending so much the night before, this seemed much more reasonable. $20/person, drinks included. Unfortunately, as much as I tried, I could not eat enough to make up for what I had paid the night before. : ) The Atrium: The atrium is divided into 3 areas, KeyWest, St Augustine, and the Everglades. The gator feeding in St. Augustine was interesting, but my 1 1/2 year old wasn't as interested as I had hoped. Get there a few minutes early so you can get a good viewing area. The reptile area in the Everglades section was small, but unique. The sail-boat in Key West was also pretty cool. There were also a couple of scavenger hunt type contests that I'm sure older kids would enjoy. You could easily spend a 1/2 day or more exploring the grounds of the hotel. The pools: We walked by the adult pool, which was usually pretty empty. It looked like a decent size regular hotel pool. There were also 2 jacuzzi's in the area. My son really enjoyed the family pool. There is not a separate kiddie pool, but the pool is zero entry at one end, and they have a nice water-play area, including a sand box area behind the pool slide that he thoroughly enjoyed. The pool was a little crowded, but we were still able to find empty chairs. On Saturday nights they have a DJ and games for the kids. Also, they had a guitar-hero competition inside the arcade - which was also very nice. Drinks and food at H20 (the pool bar and grill) were a little cheaper, but still overpriced in my opinion. Sandwiches were $15 and up. We split an ultimate burger, and fries for $16 plus tip. At the pool I ordered a Corona and a soda, and it came out to around $10. Overall we had a good time. The fees have been covered here a few times, so we knew what to expect. I agree with others that the $12 self-parking fee is ridiculous. Money saving tips: Each room has a fridge, so if you can fit it in your luggage, bring along some snacks and soda for the room. Split a meal at H20 for lunch if you can, and then go off property for a reasonably priced hearty dinner. If we stay there again, I think I will pay the extra $8 and do the valet parking. That way, we will be more likely to leave for dinner since we can easily load up and go and have a reasonably priced meal. Believe me, you will save more than the $8 difference, as there are plenty of restaurants in Orlando competing for your business. If you do eat on property for dinner, the best bargain may be the dinner buffet. It's $29 per person, but non-alcoholic drinks are included and you get unlimited salad/appetizers/entrees/desserts. I've seen a better selection for less, but you are paying for convenience, and the food is pretty good. Also, if you eat at the buffet, you can tip less...

<Title>“What an amazing hotel! A truly remarkable experience!”
<Content>I thoroughly researched various hotels in the Orlando area and decided on the Gaylord Palms because we have already stayed at the JW Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton is next door so it wouldn't be a "new" experience. Disney resorts have been getting mixed reviews so we decided to try this one. We paid $209/night to stay in the Emerald building Atrium view because we wanted quiet and I've read others complaining about the noise from the Atrium. I'm sure that's why the rooms in the Key West and Everglades buildings are a little less expensive. We stayed on the 6th floor and had very peaceful nights. Pools: Both pools on the property are amazing. They're open 24 hours a day which I've never seen at any other hotel. Both pools are absolutely huge. I was envious of those taking advantage of the adult pool because there were plenty of space, good music playing and seeming very relaxing. We have a 4 year old we went to the other pool which was very crowded but we were able to get three chairs together. I thought my son would hang out in the zero-entry area but he loved the water slide. The pool was just great and is enough to entertain all ages for an entire day. There are plenty of towels and a nearby sports bar and grill. FOOD: We picked up muffins and coffee every morning from the coffee shop. Everything was good. The prices weren't as high as I'd expect them to be when you pay for the convenience. The coffee shop is open 24 hours and also serves sandwiches. We picked up "snacks" at the marketplace which had plenty to choose from and again wasn't as pricey as I had expected although don't expect to get grocery store prices. We ate lunch at the sports bar and grill and the food was good. For the three of us our bill was $38 (with tip). Again, a little pricey but very convenient and the food was good (not "wow - best chicken sandwich ever" but nonetheless good.) For dinner one night we ate at the Old Hickory Steakhouse and all I can say is "WOW!" I read some reviews and was a little nervous that I would be disappointed for the price I was expecting to pay. It was well worth it. The steaks are wet-aged 21 days and are grain-fed Black Angus (means a lot if you know your steaks). We started with the warm pear with gargonzola cheese and it was truly amazing. If you go to this restaurant, you must try this appetizer! You don't taste the pear but the texture with the cheese flavor inside a flaky pastry style crust is just outstanding! We split a caesar salad which I'd recommend not doing because it was still too much salad for two people. The dressing was somewhat bland (I prefer caesar dressing that has a little "kick" to it.) I got the filet and my husband ordered the New York strip. He couldn't stop saying "wow!" as he was eating it! He says that this steak was not as good as "Gene & Georgetti" (Chicago) but tied for second with "Flemings" (Sarasota) and beats "Ruth's Chris" hands down. My filet was absolutely wonderful and I'd say it was the best steak I've eaten (I haven't tried "Gene & Georgetti")/ We had the loaded mashed potatoes and wild mushrooms which were both very good. For dessert we ordered the berries and cream, an apple tart (I forgot the name) and the chocolate souffle. The berries and cream were very good - nice and light. The apple tart was forgettable and I wouldn't recommend it. It wasn't bad but just not at the same level as the appetizer and steaks. The chocolate souffle was AMAZING! What a dessert! Just last weekend we had an amazing chocolate lava cake and this weekend - this souffle wins the "Best Dessert" award! It takes a half hour to prepare so you may want to order it early. We didn't order it in advance but the wait gave us time to finish our bottle of wine and relax for a bit. I had decaff coffee with dessert and typically coffee isn't memorable but I had to tell our server how amazed I was at the quality of the coffee. I wish I could have come back to just have the coffee! The server commented that the coffee is one of the best kept secrets. This was the best coffee I've had at a restaurant (and the price let's you know that!) The one bad comment is that I did send my steak back because it was not done enough for my liking. However, I really am a picky eater and I tend to send food back if it's not done to my liking. Our bill was $238 but well worth every cent! TIPS: 1) The free shuttle to the Disney parks was great. "Paul" the bus driver was very nice and friendly. What a guy! The shuttle was on-time to take us to the park and in picking us up. 2) We paid for valet parking and it wasn't worth the extra $5/day. We never left the resort so the convenience of having our car whenever we wanted was pointless. Save the extra $5 and park yourself. Self-parking is right around the corner! 3) Be prepared to pay the daily resort fee (around $16) and parking is not free. 4) Don't plan to do any work using the hotel's free internet service - it's not fast enough and "froze" several times. We saw people on laptops near the coffee shop and it's possible they got a better signal than the room. 5) Our room only had a shower (no bathtub) which somewhat of an issue with our 4-year old who does not like showers. It wasn't enough for us to switch rooms but if you have a preference you may want to make sure you get a room with a tub. 6) We decided to get a cot for our son (for some reason I thought we had a sofa bed in our room but we didn't). The charge was $30/day. Next time we stay, we'll get the two queen beds instead. Not all hotels charge for cots but this one does. Overall, I will absolutely be back to the Gaylord Palms and will eat at the Old Hickory Steakhouse when we return. This was a great experience! The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. The grounds were well-maintained and our room was very clean. Take advantage of the great discounts being offered - you'll be glad you did!

<Title>“Excellent resort...the best I've ever stayed in”
<Content>the atriums are wonderful...there are a lot of things to see...never a dull moment. Lots of great places to take pictures. Great for all age groups. Wish I could have enjoyed the resort more completely. The only bad thing is that you have to pay $12 a day for parking which i believe should not be charged for hotel guests. Also, the place is so huge that there is a lot of walking. Great exercise though, you really dont need to use the fitness center they have. It felt like we had to walk a mile just to get to our room. After a long day at the parks you get tired. The beds were a bit uncomfortable and hard but I loved that the bathroom sinks were in a separate area from the tub. That was great for everyone to be able to get ready quickly. Again, the best part are the atriums. I would definately stay there again but would request a room with a view of the atriums and a porch. Very elegant hotel.

<Title>“Excellent Stay”
<Content>I must mention that we booked our room on Priceline, so went in expecting a no-frills experience, BUT we were pleasantly surprised! First, the service was outstanding from the beginning. There was a problem at check-in, our room was not ready and it was 5pm. The Front Desk clerk could sense our disappointment (although we were very nice) and the fact that our kids were getting tired and restless so without further hesitation, they upgraded us to a suite so we could get into our room immediately. We were staying in the hotel with 2 sets of friends and had requested our rooms be together since the hotel is huge. Due to the upgrade, our room was not in the same section as one of our friends who checked in earlier so they offered us a $100 credit to use anywhere in the hotel. They also moved our friends and gave them a $100 credit too. Mind you, we all payed via Priceline for less than the credit that was offered, so I feel this was way above and beyond what the hotel needed to do. The suite was amazing and made our stay so much more enjoyable with 2 kids! The family pool was great and food and drinks were very good too. The hotel is expensive (resort fee, parking, room service, spa, etc) so even though we got a great deal on the room, it was an expensive trip. Just be prepared and bring some snacks and drinks with you since all rooms have refrigerators. Overall, it was a very nice stay and service was exceptional! Thanks Gaylord!

<Title>“Very nice hotel for a conference”
<Content>I had a conference at this hotel. I found the food for the conference to be better than average for a conference. The hotel amenities were very nice, the room was clean and comfortable. My room overlooked one of the pools and even with a room overlooking the outside I too experienced noises filtering into the room. The hotel atrium was very nice and made for a pleasant distraction but the atrium seems to be frequently used by groups as well so there may be limitations on places you can go while there.

<Title>“Your Average Stay”
<Content>Good location to everything in Orlando. Understaffed at busy times and had to wait almost 20 minutes to buy a cup of coffee. Rooms could be much cleaner. Had a used bar of soap waiting for me in the shower! Seafood restaurant was POOR. Very slow service and real greasy food. Sushi restaurant food was good, but extremely slow service. The front desk would not let me check out at noon (check out time is 11AM) claiming the hotel was "FULL". Not sure what difference that would have made in me checking out an hour later? Check in was great and very professional. Nice kids pool, just not enough chairs to go around.

<Title>“Beautiful hotel, fantastic food”
<Content>I was here with my spouse for five nights. There is so much to do, that I didn't leave the hotel for four days. The adult South Beach pool was wonderful - no screaming kids! The fitness center was small, but very nice with good equipment and tv's around. I especially liked the coke machines on each floor where you swiped your key card instead of paying with cash. I had room service several times and asked for the kids meal breakfast which was much cheaper than the adult breakfast. Nothing nearby. Towncar to outlet shopping is $15 one way. Breakfast and lunch buffetts are delicious and worth the $20 per person. Small alligator feedings inside the hotel was neat to watch. Fridge in the room was a nice touch. Demanded a king size bed which was refused at first...very few of these at this resort! Used Mears shuttle service to and from the airport and it was always on time and reasonable. Golf course nearby with free shuttle. Free internet in the room, but it's slow. Two bottled waters and paper included in daily resort fee.

<Content>Stayed for 4 nights. The staff was very friendy and the property was beautiful. The main problem was the remote didnt work on .t.v. The toilet handle was broken and barely flushed. We called and was told they would fix it within the hour. . Returned 4 hours later and still not repaired. We called 4 times and at 10:00 pm a maintanence guy came. He fixed toilet and said he would have to get a new TV. Never to return. Day 2 still no remote called a 5th time and same guy shows up (no TV) will have to find one. Tried to swithch rooms, Hah. We couldnt even get thru to make dinner reserv. The service for a 5 star is terrible. Company's beware before you book for a convention.

<Title>“Beautiful, but Noisy”
<Content>I stayed for two nights with a business conference; it may be the most beautiful hotel that I've ever seen. The Atrium with the live trees, ponds, baby alligators was way cool. Because the atrium is the center piece of the hotel, the rooms are placed around it. The atrium can be VERY noisy; there was live music playing past 10PM and perhaps closer to midnight. I always travel with earplugs and a sleep mask; I've just stayed in too many noisy places. I would definitely bring earplugs if you're coming here; you never know what will be going on in the atrium. The service was terrific; I got some great tips from the front desk staff and luggage valets. They both seemed to sincerely care about my stay and sight seeing. Just an added piece of info. A cab ride from here to the Disney Port Orleans Riverside cost me about $20-$25. My room had a basic computer terminal in it and you can check on things going on within the hotel and check out from your room.

<Title>“Not worth the price!”
<Content>We booked a week at the Gaylord Palms Resort based on the reviews here that it was an upscale luxury resort with fabulous accomodations, spa services, restaurants, etc... We decided to spend a little more for this resort, as we wanted a really special experience. The hotel is fine, the sushi and steak restaurants are good, the atrium is definitely impressive, if you can handle the cheesy fake tropical atmosphere(everything is indoors with air conditioning that rivals an Alberta Clipper). If you have really little kids (preschool and younger), the pool will satisfy you. Older kids will be bored, as the Octopus water feature sprays water over most of the 3+ feet area, which is very unpleasant to stand under. An adult pool is available, but if you are traveling with your kids you can't use this amenity. We asked for a room upgrade when we arrived, which we were willing to pay for, and were told that nothing was available. They would let us know when something opened up after the convention group checked out.. We never heard anything. Our room was shabby, dirty and very out-dated. There was mildew on the shower tile, dirty carpet, cheap bedspread and a tattered mattress skirt. It was more a room from the no-tell motel, than a upscale resort demanding a $300+ per night price tag. We had a fabulous time at Disney and will definitely be staying at one of their resorts next time instead of the Gaylord Palms.

<Title>“Nice Overall”
<Content>We stayed at the Gaylord Palms for just one night. We got a great deal on Priceline at $80 per night. Cons: I agree with the previous reviews, it is noisy and the atrium and voices can wake you. The balconies were dirty, with debris thrown on top. The beds were "meh" as far as comfort goes. Ice machine was broken on my floor. Pros: Pools are very nice. Great water pressure. Computer in every room- nice for checking email. Beautiful scenery.

<Title>“Avoid This !!! Constant Noise !!!”
<Content>I would never to chose to stay here again. The hotel is unbelievably loud. We were woken up almost every night and had to call the front desk several times to have the problem resolved. The walls are paper thin and the atrium echoes noise all day and night. Service is not great either. The attitude is generally not that good. Everyone in our group had problems with their bills. Parking was a huge pain. The scanners didn't work and it took 10-15 minutes every time you tried to leave. Fitness center was small and crowded. Not worth the $15 daily "resort fee".

<Title>“Typical Gaylord property”
<Content>For conferences and travelers attending the conference, this is a great hotel. Everything needed is in-house with lots of breakout rooms for different sessions, a large exhibit hall and nice big ballrooms. The layout is MUCH better than at the Gaylord Opryland. I stayed in a nice room in the Emerald Plaza that overlooked the Atrium. I thought the room was well appointed, everything worked properly and was kept very clean for the 7 days/nights that I stayed. The hotel staff was extremely attentive, the spa was nice (not the best I have ever been to but it was very nice). I would not travel to any Gaylord if it was not for business purposes. The hotels are very large and are basically set up for conferences and meetings. Liked the computer in the room already set up for the internet, also liked the wi-fi that was included for the laptop. Hotel's event staff is the best I have worked with and the hotel staff was also very accommodating and would go out of their way to assist when asked nicely. The hotel is near nothing, so keeping attendance high at an event is not an issue but probably frustrated attendees that don't really want to attend but companies made them. They have a free shuttle to Disney but we ended up just taking a cab when we went. The food in the restaurants was good but extremely expensive, due to the remoteness of the hotel it was troublesome to get out to other restaurants (probably why the prices are so jacked up cause there is no competition). They should include the shuttle to/from the airport in the “resort fee”.

<Title>“Mixed bag”
<Content>I booked this hotel on Hotwire for about $100/night, which was a great deal. However, they do charge a "resort fee" of about $17/night, and as far as I can tell, what you get for that is 2 small bottles of water. First, the good: the hotel has a huge atrium divided into sections that is beautiful and a lot of fun to explore. The pools are beautiful and clean. The rooms are nice (if a bit small), and the shampoo etc. are high quality. Now, the not-so-great: although the hotel is only about 2 miles from Disney World, it seems further. Yes, there's a free shuttle, but be warned that it only runs every hour, and if you are unlucky enough to be the last drop-off or the first pick-up, you'll spend a good 45 minutes getting to your destination. The hotel restaurants are expensive. Drinks by the pool were good, but outrageously priced. There is a little sundries shop, but it was $3 for a 20 ounce Coke. There is a fridge in the room, which is helpful. We didn't use the spa or fitness center, but heard they were nice. This hotel hosts a lot of conventions, and we were sharing the place with a national cheerleading competition, which was not so relaxing: 1000 teenagers with glitter makeup running and cheering at all hours. Overall, this was a great deal for the Hotwire price. If we'd paid the $250/night they claim to charge, I wouldn't be as happy. The room was nice (and we were in the Emerald Bay section, which I think is less desirable) but unremarkable. If I go back, I'll try to book an interior room with an atrium view. The inside and landscaping really are fun and interesting - fish, turtles, lush landscaping, alligators and some over-the-top settings, like the ship in the Key West section. You are in the middle of nowhere here, so my recommendation is to bring some of your own provisions, enjoy the close proximity to Disney, and enjoy the hotel for what it is.

<Title>“Awesome but be prepared to pay extra "fees"”
<Content>Great hotel, except for gouging on the "parking fee" and "resort fee". It's an arbitrary number too, like $16.84 and $13.96. They charge that odd number as if it was somehow calculated, when in reality it's just a number they made up to get a much as they can from you. It really is a great hotel, but gouging pure and simple. There is plenty of room around the resort so WHY should I be charged for parking when I am already supporting them by paying for a room and buying their over-priced food, drink, and services? Seems absurd! Actually they should give a discount to people who drive because that means they have a car and won't be using the hotel's transportation to the parks. Fees add up to about an extra $30 plus per day. It was a nice room too but very average. 2 queen beds, a TV, fairly basic. No privacy or partition. Actually a little on the small side plus the bathroom dual sink was quite small. Also, the 2 beautiful pools are too small for a hotel of this size. We were there on a cooler windy day and the kid's pool was full with no available chairs. Only one guy was serving drinks to BOTH pools. Only the most persistant got service. Nice guy though. He said the manager didn't expect much of a crowd and only scheduled one server. Two last things: The ladies working the Hagen-Daz ice cream store didn't seem to like their jobs. Second, unless you catch your room door and close it gently, it will slam very loudly. Who hasn't heard that noise before? I don't understand why something like that isn't fixed by rubber door bumpers or the metal frame filled with noise dampening foam. Many hotel have the same problem so why not fix it? I am giving you the negative things you might want to know, but I still highly recommend this place. Very close to Disney. There was a computer in the room with sloooooow access. The grounds and flowers were absolutely amazing. Whoever does the landscaping needs a raise! There was a stone structure straight out of Tomb Raider. A little swamp area complete with sounds. We had a great time just exploring the resort. I think not really a 4 and half star resort, but you decide.

<Title>“Impressive to look at--don't expect peace and quiet (or consideration).”
<Content>I stayed at the Gaylord Palms for 3 nights for a business convention in April. This is the 3rd Gaylord property I've stayed at (Nashville and Grapevine, TX). The Gaylord Palms lives up to the others in terms of style and decor with it's impressive atrium and windy paths and amazing landscaping. Overall they are nice hotels, but expensive with lots of nickel and diming charges and fees. If I way paying out of pocket (and not staying here for work), I do not think I would stay here because the price is not justified. After this visit, I will never stay here again voluntarily. This was the first time I was given an interior facing room with a balcony overlooking the atrium. At first I loved it. I enjoyed sitting on the balcony looking over the entire hotel. However, the evening of my last night, they were having some type of party or event in one of the spaces in the middle of the atrium. The event had a VERY LOUD mariachi band playing that I could hear very clearly in my room, so much so that I couldn't even watch TV. I had a 6am flight the next morning and was trying to get work done and get to bed early but it was basically impossible to concentrate or rest with the obnoxious music infiltrating my room. I called the front desk to complain and inquire how long the event would be taking place and was told that it would be going on until 10pm. This was on a Tuesday night, not a weekend. I asked if they constantly received complaints from guests for the noise and was told by the front desk person 'no, because most of the guests are here for the event." I know that is not true (and it doesn't even make sense) because there were at least 2 other conventions going on other than mine and it was spring break so there were a lot of families. For a 'group rate' of $216 per night, $16 daily resort fee plus loads of other taxes and charges, I was forced to hear crappy music in my room that was so loud I couldn't drown it out from 6pm-10pm. I find this completely unacceptable and rude to subject most of your guests to noise from one group's event. I wish I'd been at the Hampton Inn, at least it would have been quiet. My advice, park at the lobby for 15 minutes, come in and look around the atrium, then take your money and go stay somewhere else.

<Title>“Misleading, Dont stay here”
<Content>I booked the hotel on prieline. com . What a Mistake. Staff was very rude as if this was the only place to stay in Orlando. Resort fee , parking fees and best of all fee (New to me, being in the hotel business) hotel property taxes fee passed on to the tourist, as if my children were attending schools in orlando or something. I dont expect for this hotel to be open in a couple of years, just bad customer service. Priceline shame on you for misleading customers. Put the facts on the table, including all hiddden fees , priceline's booking fees and its much cheeper to not even use priceline to begin with.

<Title>“Nice place”
<Content>I stayed here 3 nights 03/26 - 03/28 2 for business,1 for pleasure. I am very happy to report no bed bugs! The hotel was very nice, bed comfortable, nice shower and good bath products. I do not like having the sink out side the bathroom but I can live like that for 3 days. The food at the hotel was very good but it is rather expense. I did take the free shuttle to the Magic Kingdom, but without a car you feel like you are trapped at the hotel. The property itself was very nice, great kids pool, nice quiet adult pool and the atrium had was very beautiful flowers/plants. This is a great hotel for a meeting or a wedding. If I wanted to return to Disney I would stay at Disney.

<Title>“Nice Facility - Misleading Billing”
<Content>We booked a king-size bed on the Internet through the Gaylord Palms Web site. We checked in believing that we were receiving a king-sized bed, but when we arrived at our room, we found two queen beds. When we called to complain, we were told the reservation was not “guaranteed” and that the only room with a king-sized bed was a "handicap accessible room." I understand contracts and fine print, but what's the point of reserving a room (and paying for it, and then flying to Florida) if you don't get what was promised to you. They take your money up front, but claim they have no obligation to supply what you believe you were paying for? Gaylord Palms can certainly rely on fine print, but hotels should avoid that, because relying on fine print almost always results in poor customer service. With regard to billing, there are some pretty significant hidden fees. It was borderline humorous to review the bill. Fees included property tax assessments against the hotel property that they were passing on to customers. It was borderline absurd. It's not a time share, people. Passing on your property taxes to a tourist may seem like a good way to pay for schools, but don’t put it on the bill, just disclose it to customers when they reserve a room. Likewise, the overnight parking fee was over $12.00 per night and the "resort fee" was over $16.00 per night. Just add the stupid fees into the room fee, rather than hiding them as an after-the-fact charges on the bill. With regard to security, one of my wife's necklaces was stolen from the bathroom counter. We could only presume it was the cleaning staff who took it. We discovered it had been stolen when we packing. My wife went to the front desk to file a report, but no one from security was available to take the complaint, so we eventually left because it wasn't an expensive necklace (fortunately) and we didn’t want to waste our time. Still, any hotel where anything disappears is cause for significant concern. Finally, and it's a minor issue, but the toilet paper dispenser in the bathroom was loose and falling out of the wall when we arrived. It was the recessed type (where the drywall has to be cut out to install it) and it could be pushed back into the hole in the drywall, which is apparently how the cleaning staff was handling the problem.

<Title>“Nice Resort with a good location”
<Content>After a Disney Cruise, we wanted to stay in Orlando for a couple of days. Our room was very nice, clean and quiet. The lobby has a convenient layout, with terminals to print your boarding passes and the staff was very helpful. I was able to leave our car rental at the onsite Hertz desk and save time getting to the airport. The gardens are pretty spectacular with lots of wild life to watch or just a good place read a book. The pools and fitness room were good and well-maintained. Around the pool area, there was an incident involving a very drunk and rowdy guest but in less than a minute or 2, management and security were on top of the situation. Didn't have a chance to try the restaurants because we were out shopping most of the time but they looked very promising. We will probably try one or 2 the next time we're there. The resort is located away from the downtown area but it's close highway on-ramp so you're really just a short drive to most places.

<Title>“Bad for vacation, great for convention”
<Content>Read this review if you are traveling for leisure. We were in Orlando for a vacation and to take a day for Disney. The Gaylord is for conventions and for a convention, it is a great place (have been to a convention at other Gaylords). But, if you are staying there for vacation, you are trapped. If you bring a car, there is a parking charge. If you don't, you have to pay for a shuttle to and from to airport. You are not able to walk to anything and when you want to get your car, you have to get the valet. You are pretty isolated and when you need something everything is at airport prices (a few dollars for a coke, etc). All of these features are bad if you are on a family vacation, but excellent if you are at a convention, where time is limited and convenience/time is a priority. It is pretty with excellent service and very clean rooms. The pools very clean and are very nice. They have a great kiddie pool with saltwater instead of chlorine, which was wonderful. Spa services were excellent and expensive.

<Title>“Impressive, but Expensive”
<Content>I was in town for a business meeting. The property is within a mile or two of attractions and restaurants, but if you are without a car expect to pay. The least expensive dinner entree are about $35 at the restaurants. My room was clean, well appointed and comfortable. The common areas have a feel of a resort with an atrium allowing natural light to poor in. The staff is the hotel's biggest asset, as they are friendly and efficient. They certainly let you know you are the customer, and the customer is always right. With all fee and taxes the room cost $300 a night - and while this is no ordinary hotel - I did not find this experience worth $300 a night.

<Title>“A great destination hotel close to it all!”
<Content>I go to Orlando several times a year for both business and pleasure. This trip, I did not have my children with me so I did not care where I stayed. I got this room on Priceline for a steal but honestly, I would have happily paid full price. This place is huge but wonderful. The atrium is gorgeous. The pools and public areas where awesome! The room was probably one of the cheapest ones. It was in the Emerald section but it was nice. Beds were comfy. It was clean and new. I had a view of Disney MGM (very far view but could still see fireworks at Epcot! I ate at the Old HIckory Steakhouse. It was pricey but one of the best meals I ever had. The room had a computer in it with free internet access which was great! The turtles and alligators in the atrium were an extra bonus! You won't be sorry if you stay here. NOTE: This is not a budget hotel. If you want a resort experience, this is the place for you. If you just need a hotel, there are plenty of good, clean decent places to stay in Orlando. The Gaylord is expensive..the coffee shop, the valet, etc. I don't mind paying for that at a resort, especially one with great dining choices, shopping, pool and even alligators and turtles!!

<Content>We held a meeting at the Gaylord Palms in early February 2009 and it was fantastic. I couldn't recommend a better hotel for meetings. Great restaurants, nice spacious guestrooms, and the staff is 2nd to none. Our convention services manager was consistently visible and helped with every small detail. Our sales manager, Farzanah Rehmatwala, was very visible as well and consistently both professional and helpful. I would not hesitate to book this property again in the future.

<Title>“Average rooms, above average price”
<Content>Stayed at the Palms in Feb. for a vacation. Thankfully we booked the room on priceline for only 40% of the stated $213 a night fee. We have stayed in better rooms at a Days Inn. Bed was hard, pillows were hard ( we brought our own), comforters were thread bare, sheets had black marks that looked like a sharpie had a party sometime ago. The Bathroom was nice, clean well laid out, Towels were soft and huge. The resort charges a resort fee of $15 a day for internet, and 2 bottles of water. However, getting your room cleaned daily is apparently not mandatory. We spent a morning at the Fitness Room, went out for lunch, spent the afternoon at the pool... came back to a note explaining the room won't be cleaned because we were in it when the maid came past. Self parking is $12 to park in a surface lot that is at least a half mile away from your room. Luckily, due to other reviews we weren't surprised.

<Title>“Great room, friendly staff, great convention facility.”
<Content>My husband was at a convention and I chose to go along. This is a great destination resort. The convention was well handled and the rest of the facilities made my stay comfortable and relaxing. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the atrium. That in itself is worth the upcharge. The room was spacious, well appointed, and clean. The little fridge in the room was nice for sodas. We both used the fitness area and spa. I really enjoyed my facial, but I found the spa facilities to be a bit disappointing. The staff was great, but it wasn't a place I wanted to spend time and relax. The chairs in the lounges were not really comfortable. It seems designed to get you in and out for treatmendts quickly. I was disappointed to find no indoor pool or hot tub in the entire facility-not even in the spa. I found it too chilly to be out in the outdoor pool, even though it looked beautiful, and I am sure it would be fun during warmer months. I did appreciate that the children's pool is separated from a large adults only pool. We dined at most of the restaurants. The servers were prompt and friendly. We found the food to be good for hotel food. The prices are about what I would expect for a big resort, they are always a bit expensive. There is a nice variety of lounges and bars with different themes. The bartenders were friendly and attentive.

<Title>“Mixed Feelings”
<Content>Weren't sure about staying at the Gaylord Palms after reading some of the reviews but went there any way. Got in really late and they were very accomidating to that. After a long plane ride we went to get some food, for two sandwiches and pops it cost us over $25 and the sandwiches really weren't that good. The next day we had to take a shuttle to the airport to get out rental car, usualy shuttle rides to the airport are free but not at the Gaylord (however the shuttle to Disney was free). There was a cockroach in the elevator which did freak me out. the computer in the room was ridiculously slow. Beautiful ponds and swimming pools, fun to walk around and just look. Went to the restaurant on the boat late after going to disney. Before sitting we asked if it was too late and the waitress said it wasn't so we sat and ordered drinks. The waitress then left us for almost twnety minutes before coming back and rudly telling us we had to order. We ordered to go, when we got the bill they had added the tip, although it was only two people and the menu says tips will only be added for groups over 8. Waitress was pretty rude, food was under cooked and not very tasty for the ridiculous price. The waitress however was theonly rude employee we meet, the guy driving the Disney shuttle was so nice and entertaining, and the valet guys were hilarious. Over all it is a very pretty resort (don't walk around after midnight they don't clean after that) but the ridiculous charges, cockroachs, and that one waitress on the boat weren't what I would expect from a resort like this.

<Title>“Very disappointing!!!”
<Content>When we checked in at the front desk, the clerk upgraded our room to a king suite but it was only a regular room with a king bed. Housekeeping was very basic at best, no vacuuming and the shower has not been cleaned during our three night stay. I find the $199 per night (group rate) is expensive, especially when the hotel has an advertized weekend rate much lower than that. The resort fee of $15 per night is too much, consider the value of the newspaper, the battle of water and the usage of the internet which was useless because it is very slow and freeze up all the time. The food at the conference was also very basic and the dinners were plain bad. I will not return and I would not recommend to anybody to stay at this resort.

We thought that doing business with a hotel like the Gaylord would insure a classy expierence but boy were we mistaken. Farzanah Rehmatwala, the Executive Sales Manager, was rude, aggressive, manipulative and down right argumentiative at every turn. I understand that some people have an accasional bad day but every single time we called her she was this way over a week. SAVE YOUR MONEY as MONEY DOESNT BUY CLASS AT THIS HOTEL. There are many other great 4 star hotels in Orlando,c hoose one who wants your business.

<Title>“When is to much, to much?”
<Content>Grounds & gardens are wonderful. Pool and surrounding area excellent. Rooms are very clean and well kept. Most all the staff are very nice and helpful. There's an added charge to your room to cover internet services, a daily newspaper and 2 bottles of water daily. You'll need to pester the maid in order to get your paper and water. Bring your own laptop.... their in room computer terminal SUX! Be ready to shell out major cash for ANYTHING you do there. 10 bucks daily to park your own car. There's NEVER enough parking spaces which forces you to use their valet parking at a higher rate. (Funny how that works, isn't it?) The food is way, way, way overpriced and no where near the quality one would expect for such a price. Avoid, at all costs, the little sandwich shop in the center garden area. I think it's called something like Java Stop, Java Shack, Java... whatever.... There's where you'll find the worse really nasty food at caviar prices. I've eaten better from a vending machine. There is a Publix grocery store about one half mile (walking distance) from the motel. There's also a Shoney's not too far, on the main drag. As well as several other well established AFFORDABLE restaurants. By eating off site we were able to save, in 3 days enough to cover our rental car expenses. In summary. A beautiful place to visit. Just wouldn't want to stay there.... again

<Title>“Fantastic hotel”
<Content>Stayed here for 3 nights for my husband's 50th birthday. Every one of the staff from the checkin to housekeeping couldn't have been any nicer and helpful. The maid who cleaned our room must have noticed his birthday cards and left a lovely note and a glass with flowers in it. On our first night (after a very long journey from Scotland) we went to the poolside bar for pizza and a drink. We told the waitress why we were staying here and the next day she recognized as and called "Happy birthday" to my husband. On the night of his birthday we ate at the Steakhouse. Yes, it was expensive but again the service and the food was wonderful. The next night we went to Sam's Fish Camp. Another great night this time with entertainers as well. The hotel itself was looking spelendid with all the Christmas decorations. With everything being "under the one roof" this was perfect for this time of year, as you could go to one of the restaurants or bars and not have to worry about the weather outside. We would certainly love to go back.

<Title>“Landscaping & decor unforgettable!”
<Content>The atrium and hotel views from the outside are WOW. It is pricey so as long as you are aware of that, then you can enjoy yourself with peace of mind. The rooms are nice....so expect a nice room, nothing over the top like the rest of the hotel, a lot of the rooms have a balcony which is fun, they went all out with the atmoshphere here. You can just walk, and walk not tire of all the beautiful, perfect trees and flowers inside the atrium. The breakfast buffet is VERY good. Overall had a great experience:0)

<Title>“Nice Hotel, yet felt like JAIL”
<Content>This is a chain hotel. I have stayed at the one in Nashville, TX, and now in FL. Each one is pretty much the same, so big that it feels like a city under glass. The property is well maintained, but once you get there, you feel trapped under glass. Even the balcony outside my hotel room, was under the glass roof (seems silly for FL). Once on the property, it is very obvious that they do NOT want you to leave (no shuttle anywhere except Disney). So, that means, you are eating in their restaurants, drinking in their pubs, shopping in their shops (get the theme)? The 259.00 per room night, was no nicer than a 89.00 Hampton Inn. No robes in the room, no extras (you even pay a 15.00 per day "resort fee" for a paper and 2 bottles of water, with no choice.

<Title>“Like living in a biodome?”
<Content>Stayed at the Gaylord Palms for 2 weeks for work. Pictures and site amenities looked great, and upon first entrance looked beautiful. That wore away pretty quickly... The food was good but not for the price, and unfortunately the location doesn't make quick trips for outside food very easy. The worst part of the hotel was the bed. Not only was the mattress uncomfortable, but the sheets were so scratchy I slept in long pants and long sleeve shirts every night. The decor seemed pretty dated. On the plus side: spent some time at the Canyon Ranch Spa, which was amazing. Definitely the highlight of the trip. The hotel staff was also great - all very helpful and polite. I'm sure this was a great place when it first opened, and can be again, but is now in dire need of updating. Really expected more.

<Title>“Gorgeous, but flawed”
<Content>We just spent a week in Florida and stayed at the Gaylord Palms Resort and Convention Center in Kissimmee for three days right after Christmas. We were delighted by the Hotel's appeareance; it was easy to find, and beautifully decorated for the holidays, but it had its flaws. Extra charges are my greatest complaint. After booking through hotwire we learned there was an additional "Resort Fee" of $16 per day. We spent most of our time off property, especially since the swimming was limited, and received no value from this unanticipated charge. We also had to pay $12 a day for parking in a lot with tiny spaces that was always almost full. The "Free Shuttle" to Universal Studios was charged at $16 per person and the free limited local phone calls showed on our bill at $3.40 each, although those charges were removed after an argument. We were wanting to see thier famous ICE sculptures, but it was another outrageously high additional charge, so we skipped it. The concierge was nice, but his food recommendations were not very reliable and his description of some attractions quite inaccurate. The resort is huge, and we had a long winding walk from the room to the exit. Our room was clean, quiet, beautful and very comfortable, although both the internet and toilet were broken when we arrived. They were repaired as soon as I called them in, and the plentiful large fluffy towels totally made up for this flaw. The pools were a major negative. The only pool that allowed swimmers under 18 years was a nice zero depth pool, delightful for young kids, but not even four feet at its deepest. This did not impress my young teens who were not old enough for the other "adults only" pool. Even the hot tub was closed the day we tried to swim, so our swimmming action was severely curtailed. Great place for little kids, but hard on teens. Not a five star experience.

<Title>“You get what you pay for...”
<Content>We recently returned from a 2 night stay at the Gaylord Palms. The hotel is magnificent and we had no problems with check-in or service. It was so nice that it was hard to drag our kids away from the hotel to go to the theme parks. They had lots of activities for the kids and even had a carnival theme day. The pool area for the kids was great and so was the outdoor grill. The drive to Magic Kingdom was literally 6 min door to door, it is so conveniently located. The hotel is tremendous with many restaurants, lounges, and great sitting areas. They had a large area right outside of there Coffee House (Starbucks like) that was great for my kids to run around. I traveled with my husband and two daughters ages 3 & 5. They absolutely loved the atrium. It was really cool to walk around and see all of the different things they had going on. Unfortunately we didn't make it to ICE so I can't comment on that. We had one minor problem on our bill upon check out, they charged us for a movie that we did not rent. With a quick phone call, they took care of it right away. The hotel was extremely clean, and so was my room. Yes some of the furnishings are different some may seem old but a good old they are. If you have stayed on Disney property it is the same way. Each hotel has it's theme w/old furnishings. I have stayed at the Beach Club and Saratoga Springs and honestly the Gaylord rates just about the same, maybe a bit higher. The hotel had a modern feel which I really liked. We are a young family and we have been away plenty of times to know if you want nice rooms, good food, and a happening yet family friendly hotel then you have to pay for it. We did and we very much enjoyed it! If we ever stay off Disney again, we will definitely be staying here and I would highly recommend it. Hope this helps....

<Title>“Wonderful Hotel !!!!”
<Content>This was our 4th visit to Gaylord Palms. We were here to enjoy the Best of Florida Christmas Experience and ICE. This hotel is sparkling clean! The service could not have been better. The ICE exhibit is amazing. We had the ice package so we had priority entrance - no waiting on the line and a free family photo - which was very professional. The hotel is beautiful and the atrium is huge. You feel like you are in a tropical paradise - with air conditioning. There is so much to do and see. The restaurants are great - but a little expensive. Wonderful getaway for the family but nice enough for a romantic weekend as well. Honestly can't find anything negative to say about this hotel.

<Title>“Poor service for an over-priced resort hotel”
<Content>Pros: (1) Looks nice from a far (2) Close to Disney theme parks (3) Decent conference areas (4) ICE (5) Nice Christmas decorations at the attrium (6) In room computer with free internet access Cons: (1) Way too pricey (2) Lobby is below average at best (3) Room is average - nothing fancy (4) Service is average - toilet tissue was not refilled on 2 days and did not get new bottle water on 1 day (5) One white parking attendent was nice but 2 black parking attendents were nasty. They intentionally parked cars around mine when I didn't leave my car key with them. Just went up to my room to drop off some stuff. (6) Extra $15/day resort fee for 2 water bottles, newspaper and computer usage is not justifiable (7) $12/day parking on top of the room price & resort fee (8) Internet was very slooooooow and couldn't open large files (9) Toilet water runs - a little annoying & waste water. Cleaning staff didn't care to get it fix. (10) One sink drainage was bad (11) The "room service/do not disturb" switch has a missing screw. Had to hold it down to press the switch. (12) Resort is isolated so family had no where to go when I was in conference. Overall, poor experience for a very pricey hotel. 3-star service for 5-star price. Will not recommend this hotel to anyone.... unless you have a conference there.

<Title>“ICE! Best of FLorida Christmas Event”
<Content>ICE! is a larger than life walk through a winter fantasy, much like the Honey I Shrunk the Kids playground. Yound kids will enjoy the small ice slides and gingerbread house. Adults will appreciate the fun of being smaller than the surroundings again. Some things to know before you go: Buy your tickets at the event so you can evaluate the crowd. The online price only saves $2 per ticket off the $19.99 adult price. If you see school busses in the lot, go another time. All the school trips and hotel guests go directly to the front of the line, resulting in our wait being well over an hour for reserved tickets (on Dec 23 at 3:00 PM). Parking is $12 plus tax, but they give you a $2 off coupon with your tickets. A free hot cocoa comes with the ticket, but you have to walk all the way to the hotel atrium to claim it. Seniors 55+ get $3 off their tickets. The ICE! show was a lot of fun, but the long wait and stiff price means it will be a once in a lifetime event for our family.

<Title>“Waste of money”
<Content>While the facility itself is immaculate and obviously well maintained, I was absolutely appalled at the treatment I received at a hotel in this price range. The service was horrible and the staff was extremely rude, from check-in to the concierge to room service. I was unable to eat at ANY of the restaurants on site bcause they were overbooked. I was told that I could wait until 11pm to eat dinner or I could go offsite, which I did. The internet and the thermostat in the room did not work despite repeated calls to management. The facility seemed to be short staffed and unable to deal with the number of guests. Waiting half an hour for the valet to get your vehicle is a little ridiculous. The beds were uncomfortable as well. Definitely go a few miles up the road and stay at a Disney property where you will receive 5 star treatment at a cheaper rate.

<Content>This was a really fun hotel for the whole family. It was very large but beautifully decorated. The kids had a blast exploring the atrium. The fish, alligators and the "castle" were favorites. We also had fun in the octopus pool. We stayed here to be close to Disney but the kids had so much fun here they wanted to stay and play. My husband and I enjoyed having the balcony overlooking the atrium. We relaxed there after putting the kids in bed. Our room and bathroom were very clean. We had one maintenance issue which was dealt with effieciently.

<Title>“Not Worth the Price”
<Content>I was very excited to have a conference for work at this hotel. I had heard such great things about it. Normally, I stay only at Marriotts, so this will be sort of a comparison to them. First, upon check-in, I was not able to get a king room, only two queens. The room was in the St. Augestine section, on the second floor. As soon a I walked in, I noticed that the room smelled like a smoker had been in it recently (it is a non smoking hotel). I tried to switch rooms but they were full. So, I thought, I would open the windows. Well, they didn't open and I didn't have a balcony. So, I went and bought a scented candle and tried to make the best of it. The room was pretty small and the colors/decor was brown/rust colored and pretty dingy. I was not at all impressed. As some have mentioned, the resort fee was high, and was supposed to include two bottles of water per day. I went to the gym after my conference and returned to my room thirsty, and found no waters in the fridge. When I called down, they said "well you must have had some in there, that is why they weren't replaced". No, I was staring at an empty fridge. I didn't appreciate having to argue. Also, on my bill they charged me for valet even though I self parked. I got that fixed after some arguing, and then they didn't want to let me out of the self park without showing my bill to prove that I had paid. It was very frustrating. For the amounts they charge ($250 and up per night), I would expect better service. Besides not replacing the water, the maid also did not replace the shampoo, lotion, etc. There was no turn down or anything. From what I can tell, she replaced may towel and made the bed only. Also, I want to comment on the expense of the restaurants. The cheapest I could find for dinner was the buffet. It was $30 for the meal, plus tax, gratuity, and one drink, got to over $40 for one person for dinner. I just thought that was too high. The second night I got room service, which was a tad cheaper, coming in at $30 for a salad with grilled chicken. The fitness center was pretty weak. When I went, no one was working there. There was no locker or changing area. They did have towels and a water cooler, with about 4 teadmills and some weights. The ICE show was neat, but a bit pricey I though considering you are only in there for about 15 minutes. Also, as someone else mentioned, the adult pool was closed 2 of the 3 days for private parties. Pros - The atrium was beautiful and well taken care of. Room service was quick and the server was great. They have a well stocked gift shop and a few other stores to browse. The servers at the restaurants were good. In all, I would recommend staying on a Disney property, or at the Marriott Seaworld or the JW Marriott Resort. I have had much better experiences there.

<Title>“This is the life.”
<Content>This is the life. Actually these words were uttered by my 5yo kid when we arrived at the swimming pool just before midnight. This is a top hotel and it's the best family hotel I ever stayed at. It would take forever to describe all the amenities and everything that was great about this hotel. Yes this hotel is expensive and yes they charge an annoying $15 daily resort fee as well as $12 for parking. Nevertheless, these extra charges are small inconveniences compared with what you get at this hotel. First of all the indoor atrium is spectacular at day and at evening/night.You can make a full day of just walking around the atrium and enjoying the sights. The pool is open 24hrs and there are two separate pools: one adults one which I never used (I only saw it at night) and another family pool where we all had a ball. This was a heated pool and there were plenty of plushy towels by the pool. The pool was outdoor which was great when we went as you can see a blue sky at night and there was also some type of an octopus slide. There was also a kids activity center at this hotel. The staff was also great. I forget the dude's name but this guy from Cape Verde was terrific. He told my kid the pool is open 24hrs and of course that meant midnight we were all there enjoying it. The rooms are great, stylish and very clean. There is even a full computer with a monitor in the room so you can access the internet for free directly from this computer. The TV was an older style but who cares when you're staying here: you don't have time for the TV. I would not hesitate to stay here again and in fact I am already planning the next trip. Even if you can't afford to stay at this hotel I still recommend visiting it (despite the $12 for parking). I do believe this is the most unique hotel in Orlando and the indoor atrium is simply stunning and again, you can spend almost a whole day just sightseeing at the atrium.

<Title>“Beware of resort fees”
<Content>The hotel itself is fine. It's very much an Orlando/Disney-style place. There's a huge atrium with trees and waterfalls and make believe Florida swamps. Very nice. It reminds me of a Las Vegas casino in that the whole property is designed to focus you inwards. It appears they want to keep you on the property. My objection is that they charge a resort fee for the pools, bottled water, internet access, and a newspaper. None of this was explained when I checked in. I probably would have paid for internet access anyway. However, I'm annoyed when hotels tack on fees that I can't decline. If they're mandatory then they should be included in the room price. Otherwise you can't compare the room cost against another hotel option.

<Title>“Great Place for the Correct Circumstance”
<Content>We live in Florida and travel a lot. I have been here three times before. I stayed in July 2006 and then went in Dec 2006 and Dec 2007 for "Ice". For the Ice shows, we stayed at Celebration Hotel which is a fantastic hotel close by. This time we stayed for two nights from Nov 21-23, 2008 in Room 3301. I do not like high floors. This is a "destination resort" but only sort of. The pool is big and nice but adequate. What makes the entire experience is the great atrium. This is one of the nicest places that I have been in. What made it interesting is that this time it got dark early. So it did not seem like an immense wall enclosed structure. It actually seemed like being outdoors without nasty insects, winds or temps. Our 13 and 12 year old really enjoyed it. We were in an Emerald Bay Room. When you check in study the map with the clerk to see if the room has the view you would like. We went to "Ice" twice. We got the season pass since it is less than two admissions. Here are my photo tips. Make sure your camera is charged up! The super cold temperatures chew up the batteries. Try taking lots of photos without flash. The ice sculputures have lots of lights in them that make great photos. The workers are very polite and will take photos of your group. Bring light gloves, socks and shoes. They make you were a huge parka that works but the hands get freezing. For dinner: It is expensive but Old Hickory was one of the best steakhouses that I have been to. Great service and great steaks and other food. But you get to eat outdoors. (but you are really inside and do not realizeit} This is when you should make sure that it is DARK. That way it is magical. The indoor areas are open so they resemble Old South luxury. Do not miss this place. Haagen Daz ice cream was excellent. Coffeebar was also good and has nice starbucks type food. If someone wants pizza and wants you to bring something up to the room then go to H2O. It is near the pool and under a walkway. Good pizza and sandwiches. Here is their gimmick. Six widescreen flat panel televisions on the wall. Each table has a radio receiver. Tune it to the station that is playing the audio for the show you are watching. It was mostly sports but if a table wants any show they will put it on. One show had some soap opera on it since some ladies requested it. Kids are definitely welcome. All in all very fun. Try and do things when it is dark ouside. It makes the mystery easier to believe. Winter is better than summer for that reason. There is nothing to walk to. Have a car. It is a quick drive to Universal and Disney. There are also restaurants like Capital Grille nearby if you need a change. We also went to Ripley's Beleive it or not. Better than I thought it would be. Our room was 3301. This is right over the buffet restaurant that we did not eat at this time. Across from the lobby opening to Key West. It may have been neater to have a straight shot at the stage where they did lots of Christmas shows.

<Title>“A Smashing Good Time!”
<Content>I booked this as a surprise to my husband for our first wedding anniversary. We were blown away by the details that were put into this resort. We had a room in the Everglades area and while we had a room on the first floor it was amazingly quiet, considering there was a convention booked for the weekend. It was nice to be able to take an actual hour long walk and not see every aspect of the hotel, that's how big it is. We wanted to see how all the different sections were decorated because each part has a different theme (Everglades, Key West, St Augustine). We also got to see the annual ICE! exhibit, which is a definite must see. The exhibit is truly 9 degrees like they advertise but you won't be in there long enough to freeze to death, I promise. The rooms have ceiling fans, which I have to say I have never seen in a hotel, and I liked it because I like to sleep with a fan on. It was just enough air circulation to not have to turn the a/c on and worry about being too cold. Every employee we encountered smiled and said hello to us the entire time we were here, which was nice. It made me feel welcome. I would definitely stay here again, and my husband even suggested coming every year for our anniversary, so we can start a new tradition. I would like to try the steakhouse on our next trip.

<Title>“Absolutely beautiful and unique, but pricey for a family”
<Content>We are a family of five. The kids are 8,7 and 4. We got an extra large room to accomodate a roll-away bed ($30/day). Kids LOVED heated outdoor family pool. There are 3 themed indoor atriums with alligators, fish, waterfalls, shops, restaurants, arcade, exercise machines, nightly shows, and more. A true, complete, destination. Only drawbacks for a family were: no kitchenettes (only a minifridge), expensive restaurants ($15 a burger, $23-32 av dinner, $15 eggs), $12 a day + tax for self-parking, $16.95 a day resort fee. The best deals: Jave Cafe and the $8 mini hotdogs at H2O. However, if you have a rental car, it is very close to RT 192 which is loaded with every kind of restaurant imaginable, plus right off Oceola Parkway, RT 4, and RT 417. Great location. We could see the Epcot fireworks nightly from our room. We just got back and the kids are begging to go again! PS: They have a kids program, but we never took advantage of it. Maybe next time- $10/hour 1 child, $18/hour 2 kids, $25/hour for 3 kids. Also never used SPA.

<Title>“Nice property, but avoid atrium-facing rooms”
<Content>I stayed at this property for 3 days for business reasons. The first night was difficult because the room faced atrium, in which they had music playing until at least 1am! The response I received from the front desk at that very late hour was that music always plays until very late into the evening. They really should sound-proof the balconey doors...or better yet, stop playing the music at a decent hour. I would like to mention, however, that the next day, the front desk did not hesitate to move me to a much much quieter room, where I could get some much-needed rest for my meetings. I assume that they get these complaints often, based on other reviews of this hotel. So...... my compliments to the hotel staff who helped in this situation, and big loud complaints to the management of this property who think those rooms are acceptable. Otherwise, the property is very nice, and they did a very good job for our conference. The food was good, the facilities were impeccibly clean and top-notch, the staff was helpful and accommodating.

<Title>“Nice but noisy”
<Content>The beauty of this place has been adequately covered in other posts, so I won't add to that. I was surprised though, that an upscale hotel such as this would have such inadequate soundproofing between rooms. As a speaker at a convention there I was looking forward to a good night's sleep, but had the bad luck to be roomed between two families with small children. I can't say what was worse: the loud TV's, the wailing kids or the frustrated parents who kept screaming at them! At around 1 AM I got hotel services to intervene. Many of the convention attendees voiced the same concerns with the soundproofing. Why would families with kids stay at a place like this anyway? It is clearly aimed at the expense account crowd.

<Title>“Spectacular Gaylord Palms!”
<Content>We absolutely LOVED the Gaylord Palms. This hotel is just beautiful, with tremendous landscaping, conmfortable rooms, and a very pleasant atmosphere. My kids liked it so much they were just as happy to play in the pool and wander the incredible landscaped atrium looking for gators and fish as to go to Disney. My wife loved the spa, and rates it second only to Qua spa at Caesars Palace in Vegas. We stayed on a night when they had "family fest" on the sailboat in the Key West section. We had a blast! Had dinner, kids got face-painted, saw jugglers, fire-eaters, animal balloons, etc..and then Capt. Sam took all the kids throughout the hotel trick or treating at various shops and restaurants. This event included dinner, and it was a bit pricey, but so much fun. Loved that each room has not only free internet, but a free computer to use(I don't travel with my laptop) Normally, things like resort fees, parking fees, and the fact that there is only expensive food options would bother me. Not at Gaylord Palms...it is so nice, relaxing, and luxurious that I didn't mind paying the fees at all. The food is expensive and average as described in other posts. We ended up doing coffee and muffins for breakfast(about $5 for a muffin and coffee), and ate most meals at Disney or nearby restaurants other than the family fest dinner. Again, this would usually bother me, but not at the Palms. Just prepare ahead of time, and realize there are many restauraunts within a 3 minute drive. There is just something great about sitting on the balcony in the evening sipping a drink overlooking lush vegetation and waterways and really relaxing. This place is so refreshing and different. We will DEFINITELy go back to Gaylord Palms.

<Title>“Loved the Gaylord Palms -- Great alternative to staying on Disney Property”
<Content>We just returned from a last minute trip to Disney World. We couldn't get a room inside Disney and found a great deal on a room at the Gaylord Palms through Dreams Unlimited Travel. We couldn't have been happier with our hotel decision. The hotel was mainly just a place to stay for our long weekend, but we thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and would recommend it to any of our friends and family. Check in -- We arrived around 12:30 p.m. I wasn't sure if we would be able to go to our room yet, but I was pleasantly suprised when we were told our room was ready. The check-in staff was very pleasant and efficient. Room -- We had an Atrium View room in the Everglades Section with 2 Queen beds. The room was impeccably clean and tidy. The bathroom had double sinks and large granite vanity area which were separated from the tub/toilet room. Our balcony overlooked the atrium which a great view. The room was spacious with a nice sized closet, separate wardrobe and desk with desk top computer. The balcony had 2 chairs on it. There was no table and chairs in the room. Would have been nice to have a small table either in the room or out on the balcony to have breakfast on, but it was no big deal. There was also a small refrigerator in the wardrobe. The hotel includes 2 bottles of water a day in your refrigerator which was a nice convenience. Bell service -- Prompt and courteous. When we checked in, the front desk clerk said our bags would arrive in 10 minutes. It didn't even take that long. Check out was just as efficient. We called for bell service and someone was there to get our bags within just a couple of minutes. Pool -- We only went to the family pool b/c we were there with our 2 year old. The pool is heated and has a short waterslide. There are also other fountains and another small slide for the kids. It's a zero entry pool and the deepest the pool gets is 3 1/2 feet. It was nice to have such a large shallow area for the kids to play. They have plenty of nice large pool towels for guests' use by the pool. The only downside was that there is no waiter/waitress service by the pool, but there is a sports bar right next door. Grounds -- Amazing atmosphere with reptile park, beautiful foliage, etc. You could spend a day just wandering around the hotel. Restaurants --There were plenty of shops/restaurants as well. We had the breakfast buffet at Villa de Rosa. It was about $18 for adults but our 2 year old was free so it ended up being pretty reasonable. I don't know what the age cut off for kids is. They had smoked salmon with all the accoutrements, an omelet station, waffles, pancakes, fresh fruit, grits, oatmeal, assorted breads/pastries, fresh squeezed juice. The service was good and the food was tasty. We also grabbed breakfast one day at the little french pastry shop. You could get fresh fruit, bagel, cereal etc. there. It was open 24 hours a day. Those are the only places we ate at on site, but there were plenty of options including a sports bar and steak house. Valet Parking -- It was around $20/day with tax. We would call before we left the room and the car was always ready when we arrived at the lobby. I knew ahead of time about the valet or self park fee, so we were prepared for it. Resort Fee -- $16.95 day. This covers your internet service in your room, shuttles to the park etc. We didn't use the shuttle service so I can't comment on convenience etc. Location -- This hotel is as close as you can get to Disney World without staying on Disney Property. When you leave the hotel take a left and you will see the main gate to Disney as soon as you go through the 1st traffic light. It was also easy access to the interstate. Spa -- they have a beautfiul Canyon Ranch spa that I didn't get to take advantage of. But I had such a nice time at this hotel that I plan to return and give the spa a try next time.

<Title>“First trip to Disney”
<Content>Overall a great hotel. It looks like a huge castle from far off. When you enter its like a whole other world. A city in building. Several restraunts and they even have alligators. Very beautiful and not to far from Disney Parks.

<Title>“Great Place Only if you Like Rock Concerts”
<Content>Beautiful hotel with Convention style service. Food is below average. However, the noise level in the hotel is terrible. The first nigth or two, the bar crowd blew us out of our room, even though we were seven floors up. The last night of our stay was unconscionable. The Hotel staged a full blown rock concert in the central indoor atrium. No prior notice was given to regular guests. The sound level was so bad, we could not hear our TV at full volume. Again, we were seven floors above the concert. Moreover, a call to the desk got us no satisfaction other than the concert would end at 10:00pm. However, after the concert - the tear down and strike of the concert kept us up all night. We cannot recommend this hotel as a quite place to stay, or one that has management concerned with the comfort of guests. They play strictly to the large conventions, and care little about the pleasure traveler.

<Title>“Very nice, food not for kids”
<Content>Wife, my young son and I were there for a conference that my wife attended. The resort is really nice and my son loved to run around and explore and he had a great time. I however, felt like the food was way more fine than what I care for, and there was not a place for kids to eat. Otherwise, pools are nice, service was good, place was clean. If it was not for the wife's job to pay for the high dollar rooms, I would not have gone there.

<Title>“Amazing value and great resort”
<Content>We just returned from the Gaylord Palms. This was one of the greatest hotel values we have ever had. The price we paid on Hotwire was a bargain for such a nice resort. We loved the room, restaurants, pool and service. It was a nice surprise to have a computer in the room with free internet service. This was great. You can even order breakfast, check out restaurant menus and review/pay your bill online here. The service at the restaurants was excellent. We enjoyed the Steak House and Buffet. We had exceptional service at the Steak House especially when you consider that we arrived at 9:30 p.m. It was amazing to enter different areas of the resort to find new surprises. The Pirate ship in the middle of a lagoon is a restaurant/bar. The kids pool has a great slide and water jets that spray water into the pool. There is also a nice mini golf circuit. There is also a PGA Tour Shop where we found some great bargains on golf shirts. The 24 hour coffee bar was a nice feature as I had a 7:00 am business meeting there. The lobby has a computer and printing station specifically for printing your boarding passes. This was nice. We used the shuttle service to and from the Magic Kingdom. This took about 45 minutes. Would like it if they had shuttles leaving every 30 minutes rather than every hour. My only complaint is that we didn't stay longer.

<Title>“Do not stay here? They'll nickel & dime you and it's overrated”
<Content>Found filthy shoes under bed. Bedding smelled like sweaty body odor. Complained. They said they'd fix it. 14 hours later: still not corrected. Charged $12 to park our car in their lot. Charged $18 for one wrongly dialed long distance call (got wrong # recording) and another $18 when call went through. Paid $2.50 for small Yoplait at convenience store. Paid $50 for small salad and soup for two people. At every turn, they WILL gouge you. We were there for a convention, and looking forward to what we thought was a top notch hotel. This place could be magnificent, but management is greedy and lax. They are after expense account clients who care less about costs and who are too busy to worry about quality. One last thing. My wife and I are pretty easy graders. We'll even give a great motel (as opposed to a fine hotel) 4 stars when the rooms are comfortable and the staff are on game. But that isn't the Gaylord. While many of the bellmen and other staff are wonderful, their management and ownership are more focused your wallet than on clean rooms and fair prices. Go somewhere else. Just remember two things: dirty shoes and filthy bedding still not corrected half a day after the complaint; $18 for an incorrectly dialed phone call.

<Title>“Loved the Gaylord Except”
<Content>Great Hotel with a beautiful landscaping and courtyard. I had a room overlooking the atrium which was absolutely fantastic. The room itself was great, except the following items: The room did have some black mold in the groutline of the shower. This could easily be fixed with some cleaner and the shower ceiling did have some peeling paint which again can easily be fixed. Overall I would not hesitate and I have already booked this hotel again next month! The absolute best value for the dollar!

<Title>“Beautiful, comfortable, snooty, and expensive.”
<Content>First impressions of a place are always the ones that last, and this is definately a place that does not initially feel welcoming - unless you are rich. When we pulled into the circle to unload our luggage, a lady asked us if we wanted to valet park or park our own car. I asked her how much it was for valet and she replied 18 dollars. I said we could park on our own and she said "ok, that is 12 dollars a day." Yes...you have to pay 12 dollars a DAY to self park your car. I wondered if I was at a theme park or a hotel! When we got inside, the place was very beautiful and upscale, and having just come from a theme park, we felt out of place. The lady at the counter looked at me in distain when I approached the counter and asked me to spell my last name at least 3 times before she let me have a room key. Then she asked me for a credit card without telling me what would be put on it (beware that whatever card you give them WILL incur all charges from your stay, including a 15 dollar resort fee to use all of their stuff you probably won't use in the first place. This may be 15 dollars a day as well, not just 15 for your stay). Do not expect continental breakfast and do not expect to eat in the hotel for less than 20 dollars a person. With an over 200 dollar a night price tag, this place charges way too many hidden costs to make it worth your while if you are on a budget. The rooms, however, were very comfortable and accomodating, and the sights in the hotel and pools were also breathtaking. I would recommend it if you don't care how much you spend on your stay.

<Title>“Horrible service - very disappointed”
<Content>I was so excited when I got my Priceline room at Gaylord Palms, as I had always wanted to stay there. Checked in, found out about not only the resort fee but the parking fee (combined $26 per day). Oh well, live and learn. Waited for my luggage for almot an hour - called three times, the hotel was not even crowded. Went to take the free shuttle to the park the next day, it left earlier than posted. We advised the concierge and she took care of it, by having a town car take us to the park. Got back after a long day at Disney, room was not made up. Called and waited, no one came. Called and spoke to a manager, Lisa,she stated she would take care of it. We were going out to dinner, she would have it done by the time we got back - did not happen. Also had a separate reservation as I was staying up for a business trip. Was told by the front desk that I would have to check out and check back in, even though I would be in the same room. When I spoke to the manager, she told me I could do it ov er the phone, but needless to say, that never made it to the personnel at the checkout desk. When I called LIsa again, about the room not being made up and the reservation issue, she told me she would remove the resort & Parking charges from both reservations. When I checked out, I had to go and have the charges removed. I was very disappointed with the hotel, the service and the fact that the adult pool was closed for private events the entire time I was there.

<Title>“Great for Convention”
<Content>I stayed at the Gaylord for a MOPS convention last Sept. There were four of us in a room, so it was a bit crowded, but we made it work. At 200 dollars per night (convention rate) we couldn't afford more rooms. The Gaylord is beautiful! It was such a wonderful experience, so relaxing. You didn't even have to leave the building the entire day and with the sunroof you still felt like you had been outside. The food wasn't too pricey, and we were able to drive to other restaurants easily. I didn't use the pools, but they looked nice. The only negs. was the cost of parking and the large size made the walk from the convention hall to the room quite long. Also, they were booked to capacity and the less expensive restaurants had long waits in the morning and at lunch. I would highly recommend the Gaylord and would love to have the opportunity to take my three young children there.

<Title>“Great Getaway”
<Content>The Gaylord is a great place to relax. It's like a little city, you can check in and not have to leave but if you want to they have free buses to Disney and Universal. The inside is spectacular and the pool is nice too. It is pricey but it's an upscale resort so that is expected. The rooms are decent size, nice marble bathrooms, comfy beds. The first night our room was overlooking the atrium and it was loud, some kind of party going on very late so they moved us to a quieter area. We ate at Sam's and it was okay, the steak was a little chewy and the lobster so so. I enjoyed the breakfast buffet the next day, which happened to be my birthday and the waitress was glad to fullfill my special requests. I actually won my trip on a radio station so it was extra nice to stay for free!

<Title>“Loved the service!”
<Content>The resort is amazing! The kids loved the pool, the live tarpon, and the gators. The service was impeccable! I have never been treated so well. Only complaints are that the beds are a little hard and the food choices are rather pricey. For example, the only breakfast options are to order the $19 buffet, go to the coffee shop for muffins, fruit, or cereal. I was looking to just get some eggs and bacon which I could have possibly done with room service. Even so, I will definitely stay at this resort anytime I am in Orlando.

<Title>“Great hotel !”
<Content>Arrived for a one night stay with husband and seven month old. We live near Orlando and this was a last minute add on to our trip. Lobby/atrium was massive in size. Very impressive. Check in was smooth. Valet parking/price was standard for resort. We went to our room immediately and I was very impressed with the decor and the ceiling fan was a plus. We had an atrium view. We got a great rate for 99$ from outside website.Taxes and resort fees/parking,food put us closer to 200$ for one night. Pools were nice yet packed with children due to a convention. My husband loved the sushi at the japanese lounge. The only negative aspect to our stay was the last minute leaving. We called for a bellhop who promptly came. He mentioned to my husband that he would not be the one who put the bags in the car. My husband tipped him. We ended up tipping the one who then put our bags in the car. This seemed odd for this class resort. Double dipping at its best!! Overall a great stay...Would return for a decent rate.

<Title>“Exceeded all Expectations”
<Content>Wow!! What an experience. We arrived around noon, and we asked the valet parking attendant if we would be able to check in early. He told us he did not think there would be any problem, and checked our car. He asked for my last name and then advised me that my luggage would be taken care of. My wife and I went in to the front desk, asked if we could check in early and we were told no problem. We checked in, then decided to go get a drink. After almost two hours we decided to go up to our room and call the valet service to have our luggage delivered to the room. Imagine our surprise when we opened the door to our room and found all our luggage already delivered. This was just the beginning of a wonderful weekend. We explored the grounds and sampled all the tastes of the various food shops and the libations at the various adult beverage stations. We had dinner at the Old Hickory Steak House, and words cannot describe the experience. All in all, it was a wonderful way to celebrate our 28th wedding anniversary. We are going back in October just for a night because we had such a fantastic time. I would recommend the Gaylord to anyone who appreciates pampering and fine dining. If you want to save money, head to Motel 6. If you want a great time, do it at the Gaylord.

<Title>“Pleasantly Surprised and Satisfied with my Stay”
<Content>Just got back from a 6 night stay in Gaylord Palms Resort. Pulling up in the taxi I could not believe this is where my family of 4 was going to be staying, walk in and hear the waterfall - it was beautiful. Go to check in and the person at the desk upgraded our room facing the pool to a room facing out onto the atrium (a $40 a night upgrade) for free. On the walk to our room we see alligators and beautiful koi fish and lots of pirate treasures, my 8 yo and 4 yo daughters were so excited when they saw this and then .... the pool! It's a shame we didn't get to use the pool much because most of our time was spent and Disney and Universal. I love the fact that they are environmentally friendly and ask guests that want to help save on water to re-use the towels. Everyone that worked anywhere in the hotel was friendly and knowledgeable and their restaurants were wonderful. I will be recommending this hotel to everyone I know!

The ONLY decent service we received was from the ice cream place.We had lost orders...rude housekeepers...uninformed valets....guests services could not even tell us how to get to the mall!And our check out was a disaster....got home to discover we had been double billed!Called the hotel and was greeted rudely and then no explanation was given for the double billing and no apology given. We will NEVER recommend this place to anyone!

<Title>“Good For Convention Attendees”
<Content>I stayed at the GPR for a convention on 2 separate occassions. This is a very nice hotel for business travel - wonderful service - good amenities - excellent spa. The restaurants are excellent by Florida's standards, although the service is very slow. The rooms are nice - very clean - computer in each room + complimentary water (included in resort fee). I loved the large double vanities in the bathroom area as well. I don't think I would go there for a family trip, though - there are better hotels in the area that cater to kids and more reasonably priced.

<Title>“Ok, stay this time.”
<Content>We have stayed at the Gaylord many times in the past and have always enjoyed the stay. This time was different. First let me start by saying they had a wonderful slow food event on June 27 with wine tasting . This was wonderful ! Hats off to Chef Paul ! We had decided this would be great as a birthday dinner and would stay the weekend. I called to make a reservation at the hotel and the young lady I spoke with was rude, so I wrote a letter to a manager and they responded and said they where sorry. The reservation manager promised me a quiet room in the Everglades area, she even called me to ask what area I would like to be in and if I would like a high floor. We agreed on a high floor and that the room would be in the Everglades area. Check In : People standing in line and only two people at the front desk. Lisa said our room was ready and I asked where it was located .....she said in the Key West area ..this is, by the way a noisey area as they play music and it seems to be where alot of families go with young ones. I asked to see the room first. She took us down to the room which was on the first floor and remember she said the room was ready. When we walked in the room was dirty and the bed was not made. Back to the desk . Now remember we where to have a room that we requested because of a problem we had on the phone . Wouldnt you think a reservation manager would note in the computer everything she and I spoke about. Lisa kept saying that there was nothing available.....she spoke to a manger on duty and explained the whole thing to him. He totally ignored us like we where not standing there until I asked to speak with him. He walked over and I now explained everything to him and he said he would give us a room in the Everglades for the night and change to the suite we where suppose to have the next morning they would call us when it was ready. Room : Finally got to the room and it was one that had a connected door to other room ! They had a child who screamed most of the day and into the night. I called down and asked for Lisa and she said she would call me back about another room.NEVER HAPPENED. Guess when I got the call that the new room was ready 9PM the next night! Wonderful, we where leaving in the morning. Pool : They have a wonderful pool for children . Adult pool says no one under the age of 18 in this pool . Well there are parents that cant read as this one guy is swimming all day saturday with a baby in a diaper in the adult pool. Screaming wonderful! This was suppose to be a quiet relaxing weekend for us. I told a attendant but he did nothing about it. A group of drunks took over the jacuzzi with there own cooler filled with bozz. WHERE IS MANAGEMENT ? Beds : I agree with someone who wrote about the beds. Poor sheets and cover. Good Points : Beautiful resort to walk around in and enjoy there plants, kept up nicely. I have told many of my friends about this hotel from the north and ones that live here in Florida as well, but after the problem with the room, and noise I have my doubts now. It seems the resort had changed in the last few years. Contact me if you need more information.

<Title>“Overrated”
<Content>I attended a conference there in May 2008 and the hotel is just "OK." It is like being in a big glass bubble. When I attempted to check in at 12:00 PM they told me "my room was not ready yet, to come back at 2:00PM." I went and had lunch and returned at 2:00 PM. Then they proceeded to tell me "that all the rooms were now booked." To say the least I had a few words with a manager and by surprise a room appeared. Yes, they had my reservation on file. the room was OK, nothing special, hard bed. One advantage of the hotel is the proximity of the property to Disney. 10 minute drive. At check-out, watch out for union rules. Bellmen can only take your luggage to the door, then a valet must come and get it. How stupid is that. In the ned, this was my one and only stay at this hotel.

<Content>Got a good rate through mousesavers.com for one night because my son wanted to stay here for his 16th bday after seeing it on the travel channel. Mentioned it to Steven at the front desk and he double upgraded us to a delux suite and even sent him a bday card with bags of popcorn, chips, and pretzels. My son was so excited! The pool was warm and a lot of fun with the zero entry pool for the little ones and the slide for the 16 yr old. The pool is always open. The decor is beautiful in the resort and in the rooms. Lots of cars but didn't feel crowded at all. The shops at the resort were very nice with reasonable prices. There is a bakery, a bar, ice cream shop, and a few places to dine. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we considered staying here a second night. We will be back next year!

<Title>“Rooms Not Worthy of a 4 Star Hotel”
<Content>I stayed at the Gaylord to attend a convention at the hotel. While the common areas are nice, the rooms are not worthy of a 4 star hotel. The bedding consisted of a dated looking bedspread and a cotton blanket. The chair at my desk was dirty and stained. While there was a track for a privacy curtain (or sheer), there were none. I thought it was just missing from my room, but after looking out my window, I realized that no one had them. Also, I wished they had real cream instead of the powder packs for the in-room coffee. On the plus side, the beds were comfortable and the bathrooms are nice. We also had 2 bottles of complimentary water in the room frig everyday.

<Title>“Nice public areas - ok rooms”
<Content>I attended a convention at the Gaylord Palms Resort & Convention Center. Although the resort is located close to the main stretch of the tourist area of Kissimmee, it is somewhat remote. There is nothing within walking distance. If you want to go shopping or to a restaurant off the premises, you have to drive or take a taxi. The lobby and public areas are very impressive - almost theme-park like, however the rooms are very average and generic. I was surprised that such a "high-end" hotel would still have old tube TVs. The bed was poor - no down duvet and a couple of lumpy pillows. The mattress was hard and uncomfortable. I have slept in better beds at 2-star hotels! The room had an empty fridge, but no mini-bar. There was also a coffee/tea maker with paper cups. I expect paper cups at a 2-star hotel, but not at a 4-star hotel or resort! I did not have any time to use the hotels amenities such as the pools, but they looked really nice. Some of my colleagues at the convention complained about the service and attitude of the staff, however I found them friendly and courteous. Would I return to this resort when on a pleasure trip? Probably not. Considering he mediocre room and bed and the remote location, there are much better hotels such as Hyatt or Marriott, where the beds are really comfortable.

<Title>“Nice mega hotel”
<Content>Having read the negative reviews prior to our trip, I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. We were there late March for a cheerleading competition which was held at the attached convention center. The hotel was reserved for the competition, so it was cheerleader mania. Our room was in very good condition, and the bathroom was beautiful. Housekeeping did a good job of cleaning the room each day. We stayed in an atrium room, so it was somewhat noisy during the day. But with hundreds of cheerleaders roaming this huge hotel, what do you expect?!! We had a very good dinner at the seafood restaurant (can't remember the name) - the one with the attached boat. Everyone was pleased with the food. All in all, I was very happy with this hotel given it's enormous size.

<Title>“Loved the Gaylord!”
<Content>My friend and I just returned from a 2 night getaway to Florida. Upon arrival we were very impressed by the outside of the hotel. The pictures do it no justice. Before you read about all of the things we loved here's a few things we didn't like so much. Reosrt fee- We figured it should be included in the regular price. It's roughly $16.95 per day if you don't take a car. If you have a car it's another $12 per day. The resort fee includes the shuttles, internet, paper, and 2 bottles of water per day. Our room was basically over the valet and drop off area. It was rather noisey. We kept hearing loud noises all night. The rooms don't have a mircowave, but have a mini fridge. So don't bother bringing things home from the resturants that need to be reheated. And now the things we loved.. We had an early flight into Orlando and were very happy that the hotel let us check-in early. Our room was very nice. It was on the 7th room. We did not have an atrium view room but it really didn't bother us. We didn't see paying the extra money per night to be worth it. You can basically spend the entire first day exploring the resort, it's SO big. The atrium was awesome. There's so much to look at. The stores we're cute,but a bit on the pricey side. We decided to eat at H2O after we got settled. Be prepared for high resort prices. It was $14 for cheeseburger and fries. After lunch we went to the transportation lobby and found that the Universal sales rep had left for the day.. it was only 1pm. That seemed a little off. So we decided we'd have to come back tomorrow morning and get our tickets. After that we layed out by the adult pool. It was nice to not have screaming kids running around and relax. There is a waitress walking around and you can order drinks. The pool was a nice size and there were plenty of lawn chairs. There are a few hot tubs near the pools. They are open 24hrs. We found going after sunset was best and it's much more enjoyable. For dinner we went to the Pirates Dinner Adventure. The hotel workers were very good at getting us a cab. For a Mears towncar it was $35 for maybe 12miles. We got a another cab on the way back and it was only $28. The hotel has free shuttles to most of the amusement parks. I suggest taking the shuttle and not driving. We did the Villa de Flora resturant for dinner the second night. They have a nice buffet. It was roughly $30 a person plus tip. The food and service was excellent. Checking out was easy. You can do it right on the computer in the room. Overall we had a great time. I would recommend this hotel and I would love to go back again.

<Title>“Great honeymoon, more than wee expected”
<Content>This is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. They upgraded us to a suite right when we got there. The customer service was great and all around a 5 star hotel. This resort has everything you could ever need. Restaurants, Pool, Shops, Gator Show. I will definately stay here again.

<Title>“Beautiful grounds but just so so room”
<Content>We just got back from a three night stay at the Gaylord. I had heard wonderful things about the hotel from a coworker . I did love the grounds and the childrens pool was the best I had ever seen at a hotel. My three year old loved it. We had a few issues with parking and finding our area to park. We arrived late at night and their directions weren't the best. When we finally found our entrance our key card didn't work to open the door. On our way to our room we passed a group of six men sitting outside their rooms which was not what I expected to find at this hotel. Our room was just ok.. Perhaps it was because I had booked through Priceline. It was a large room with a king size bed which we had asked for . It just looked like it needed a really good sprucing up. I would stay here again as my child really loved the pool and we were barely in our room.

<Title>“A Great Getaway!”
<Content>I just came back from a 3 night stay. This hotel is awesome! The rooms, the grounds, the service - excellent! The atrium is breathtaking. It was fun to just walk through the grounds and see the different surprises tucked into the luxurious landscaping. There's a gator pond, koi ponds, a castle, among other things. There's a kid's area but the hotel is more geared to adults. There's some shopping, a miniature golf course, a spa, a fitness center, and very good restaurants. You don't really need to leave for anything but if you do everything is within driving distance. I was with a conference so I had shuttle service. I heard taxis were a little pricey. From the airport take the shuttle - $16 each way on Mears. One quibble - the beds were too firm for my taste, but everything else about room was great. Free internet access, a fridge, and a safe. For a little more, $40, you can have a room with a balcony that overlooks the atrium. I plan to visit again - soon.

<Title>“Loved Gaylord Palms!!!!”
<Content>I cannot say enough kind words about The Gaylord Palms. I did a lot of research for a hotel in the Disney Area. It was between this hotel and the Royal Plaza. Let me just say this exceeded all expectations. Not only is the hotel stunning in every way, the staff is the most courteous I have ever met. Everyone went out of their way to assure the most wonderful stay. My only complaint is that I wanted to stay one extra night and was told the hotel was completely booked. I ended up staying that one night at the Royal Plaza, which I call The Royal Dump! I will spare you all the horrifying details but say this, I paid LESS for my atrium view room at Gaylord than I did for my first floor parking lot view at the Royal Plaza. Gaylord Palms will win my vote any time.

<Title>“This is the Disney World of Hotels”
<Content>Words and pictures are not enough to describe this hotel. If you visit the Orlando area and stay in this hotel be sure to set aside one day just to enjoy the hotel and put off visiting the other attractions. Check in was a breeze and I was even able to check in at 11:30 a.m. My room was beautiful, spacious and spotless. Unlike most other hotels that will provide you with three bath towels and then you have to call for one more (being that we are a family of four) they routinely provide you with six bath towels at the Gaylord. There is a refrigerator in the room and a computer with internet access and access to detailed information on what the hotel provides. You can even schedule having your luggage picked up at a certain time and getting your car out of valet as well, through the computer. The hair products and soaps were fabulous and unlike the Ritz Carlton you get a fresh supply each day. Luckily, at check in I was provided with a map. You will need it for at least the first day to find your way around this immense wonderland. The Everglades area is beautiful and something to see both in the daylight and at night. It looks very different in the evening. Be sure to look at the snakes and baby alligators. The St. Augustine area has a large castle reproduction of the Castillo San Marcos in St. Augustine, FL. Kids will enjoy pretending to be pirates in this area. The Key West section is very nice and has a very nice restaurant part of which is on a ship in a lake in this area. Best thing is it is all air conditioned and you feel like you are outside. There are also alligators that are fed three times a week and feeding times are posted. The pools are both great but I have to say the kid's pool was my favorite. It has some great areas for kids to play in and a water slide. All the restaurants are great. You need to make reservations for Sam's Fish Camp and the Hickory Steakhouse. The Sushi place and H2O are also wonderful. I did not have one bad meal. If you want to save money, the Java Coast Cafe has great sandwiches and salads for a much lower price than the sit down restaurants. The hotel provides transportation to the Disney parks and return transportation is provided until one hour past the park's closing. Many other Orlando hotels (outside of Disney's own hotels) do not offer such a generous time span for transportation. It was such a good stay that we will defenitely return to this hotel before the end of the year.

<Title>“Great hotel and food's fantasitic”
<Content>My husband and I visited for the weekend and expected a typical Disney -style hotel, even though not Disney owned. It was waaaay better. We didn't even leave the property for two days. It's a city unto itself under a massive atrium. Suite was spacious and comfy. Had the best filet mignon of my life along with great seafood and sushi at other restaurants there. Massage and manicure terrific, nice pool. Slept great (their curtains totally blocked out light). The plants inside the atrium are very impressive. Everything is tropical and live. An extra treat to our stay was a treasure hunting contest they are having through the summer. Much harder than I expected, but winner gets $10,000. Won't know the winner until end of summer. Wish us luck!

<Title>“Amazing”
<Content>Everyone has to go to this hotel in their life. Absolutely amazing. Has a huge atrium in the middle with tracks, trees, gators, restaraunts, shops and the rooms face into them with balcony. Beds are huge and comfy. The atrium provides entertainment all day and night long. Only downside is the expense - bottle of wine $60. The convention centre is fantasticly huge and has great ice sculpture conventions at christmas. Would go back if i could afford it!

<Content>Great time first stay at the Gaylord! We arrived very late and the staff were most helpful! Also, the rooms were very clean and a good size. The property was beautiful as well. It was great to have the option of the "adult only" pool with bar next door. I would definitely recommend the Gaylord and strongly consider returning for a stay my next time in Orlando!

<Title>“Nice resort but would rather stay at the JW Marriott”
<Content>I just returned from a stay at the Gaylord Palms. My friends and I were in Orlando for a work related conference. The conference was in another hotel. We got a good rate from priceline and were excited to experience the Gaylord. It is a beautiful resort. It is a must see, even if you are not staying there. The inside gardens are amazing. Each area of the expansive atrium represents a different region of Florida. We stayed in the Everglades side. The room was a standard size double bed room. The bathroom was a bit small. The room was clean and we had a good outside view. My issues were the $12.50 per day for self-parking and the $16.50 per day resort fee. I suppose it was to cover the daily newspaper and 2 bottles of Dasani water and the in room computer which continually froze whenever we accessed the internet. The beds were uncomfortable, the three of us all agreed that we felt like we were sleeping slanted in the beds. The mattress were thin. So even though we had a nice stay, I would rather drive the few extra miles and stay at the JW Marriott. The parking is free, the rooms are more comfortable and the bathrooms are spacious. Plus the JW has a better pool area.

<Title>“Great pool, location. Hope to return!”
<Content>We enjoyed our week long stay at the GP. Atrium is beautiful, and unique. I liked the pool and that it was open 24 hours. Kids enjoyed a midnight swim or two. Very close to Disney attractions. We rented a car and took advantage of nearby grocery store Publix, to stock in room frig. While it was close, it was probably not walkable as there were no sidewalks. Restaurants , tho also not walkable,were also close by, so one had options to the costly resort restaurants and Disney World eatings. In room computer worked fine. Able to keep in touch with work and home emails. Was on vacation and should not have even bothered with those. We scored this stay on Priceline and were aware ahead of time of resort and parking fees which amounted to $30 additional a day. I knew of this, so was okay with it. Housekeeping was very good, and I thought the rooms were a good size for a family of four. Key West end had us closer to the family pool, so I would recommend that for families. It is a large place, but, I did not find it overwhelming. The kids enjoyed the arcade and ice cream shop. Good, altho pricey drinks on the boat in the atrium, but, for a treat, it was worth it. Our bar bill was big, but, after a day at Disney World, even that seemed reasonable!! The GP is a conference hotel so many conferences take place. While some areas of the resort were closed to non conference attendees, that did not bother us at all, and I don't thing we bothered them.

<Title>“Great property, high fees”
<Content>The interior of the hotel is beautiful, with the atrium being a tourist destination of its own. We requested a room in the Everglades since it is one of the quieter areas of the hotel. Our friends paid to upgrade to an atrium view for $40. We felt like that was too much so we kept our room facing the parking lot. The kids enjoyed the pool and newly finished play area. Surprised that there were no lifeguards, considering several unsupervised kids were climbing up the slide and crashing into one another as they came down. The resort fee and parking total $30 a day, which is a bit much. The in-room internet service was nice, but SLOW. The whole property was well maintained and the service was top notch.

<Title>“Massive, great hotel!”
<Content>I stayed here for two nights recently. It is an awesome hotel. It's a massive complex made up of a convention center, a bunch of restaurants and a great pool area. It was clean, the rooms were very nice, and the staff was great. Each room has a computer with the internet if you need to use that. They have a bar with dueling pianos at night, which was a lot of fun, and you didn't have to worry about driving. I ate at the Italian Restaurant. It's a fixed buffet, and it was delicious. I also ate at the sports bar, which was not as great. My cousin and I both got massages at the Canyon Ranch Spa located on site, and it was pricey, but well worth it. Overall, we had a great stay and I would highly recommend it.

<Title>“Instead of staying at Disney- stay here!!!”
<Content>Loved it!!! After much hemming and hawing as to whether to pay the money to stay on the DIsney property in a hotel that did not get the best reviews and also after thinking of being at the mercy of Disney transporation (which is not all that great- depending on where you stay), we decided on staying at this huge hotel right down the street. With our inexpensive rented car, it was a 5 minite drive to Disney and there was a CVS and a grocery store right around the corner. of the hotel- 2 minute drive. The service was fabulous, the rooms clean and modern and the lobby and features awe inspiring. We ate at the seafood restaurant (in the large ship in the harbor in the "lobby") and it was OK, the steak house was great- a wonderful romantic meal, while our kids had room service. The sushi bar was very good and there is even excellent shopping in the hotel. We never got a chance to use any of the pools but the grounds were nice with designated smoking areas as there are none inside the hotel. This is a convention hotel so you will see that type of "having fun while working" crew out and about but it was fairly quiet when we were there. The food, parking, and hotel taxes did add up, but if going to Disney again, we would stay there in a heart beat!

<Title>“Mostly a Positive Experience”
<Content>The Good: -Loved the 4 acre atrium area, especially the Everglades section. -The restaurant Villa Flora had an excellent breakfast buffet, and included an omelet and pancake station. The poached eggs over hash were especially good, as was the oatmeal with fruit. For lunch the Mediterranean buffet was excellent as well, with tons of choices.Don't miss the ice cream bar, where you can add your choice of candies, cookies, and hot fudge. All rooms come with a computer. I had read that they were really slow, so I brought my own laptop. This was not necessary as we found the internet pretty fast. The rooms in the Everglades section were nice. They may not have been upgraded yet to the pillowtop mattresses and the plasma tv's, but the room was comfortable none the less.The rooms with the balconies were $40 more a night, but we felt it was worth it. It was a nice place to sit out and enjoy a glass of wine before dinner. Yes, the hotel has a resort fee, but you know that upfront. It includes 2 bottles of water a day, free internet, gym, and 1 bucket of golf balls a day. Service was good,from the front desk, housekeeping,concierge, and valet. There is free transportation to all the Disney theme parks. The bus leaves every hour in the morning and comes back every hour and a half in the afternoon. It was a very short trip to Epcot. The outside pool is really nice, and there are plenty of lounges.2 hot tubs as well. Food service by the pool was good. We had salads which we all liked. The BAD: We did not like the rooms in the Key West section, where they put us at 1st. The rooms had a musty/fishy smell, and the carpet looked gross.It is also much noisier here as it overlooks the noisy bar in the atrium. They did switch us to the Everglades section. One day they closed the pool at 3:30 for a function. The kids pool was closed for renovations so this left no options for swimming.We were there for 4 nights and this happened just once, but still I think that is totally unfair to the guests. Tips: If you have little kids, the Emerald Bay section would be a good choice to be close to the kids pool. The Everglades section is best if you want a quieter area that is the closest to the adult pool, gym and spa. 20 somethings would probably enjoy the Key West section the best. All in all we had a great 4 night stay.

<Title>“Nice place”
<Content>This is a beautiful place with a wonderful atrium and facilities. The gardens inside the atrium are gorgeous. The Italian/ Mediterranean buffet was very nice and we had wonderful service from Ricardo and Karen. Our hotel room was not fabulaous, but not bad. There was paint chipping off in the bathroom and dusty fixtures in the bedroom (not what we would have expected based on the rest of the hotel), no wash clothes and a few other minor things that were not impressive. We did not pay rate rate and unless you really plan on using all the facilities, I think the rack rate is overpriced. All in all we have a very nice stay and would certainly go again (for a discounted rate)

<Title>“Worth a visit but you pay to park...”
<Content>While making a dinner reservation for the Old Hickory Steak House I thought it would be kind of cool to just stay the night. Kind of a surprise of my wife's birthday. We left work together and headed west when I sprung the surprise on her. We checked in with the clothes we had on our back and two plastic CVS bags of overnight essentials. Got bonus points for spontinaity. The over all experience was just dandy... as they say, you get what you pay for. Dinner was pricey but the steaks were way above average to pretty darned good. (Steaks at our local Del Friscos are tough to beat when you venture into that price range but they were on par with Ruth's Chris... chocolcate souffle was off the chart. I always manage to find a pimple on the buttocks of an otherwise great experience and this one came when the folio arrived the next day. Thirteen bucks and some change for a self parking fee. Maybe I have a small town mentality but I have parked my own car in some pretty decent hotels from Orlando to Hawaii and never got stuck with a self parking fee. Found it kind of insulting.... I mentioned, only mentioned to a front desk manager during check out and she removed and apologized. Why the fuss? We dine their frequently... Sunset Sams several times and Sunday brunch here and there... when you drive up and dine at the establishment the eatery will happily validate your parking ticket and you don't pay for the priviledge of dropping a few bucks for a good meal and a great frozen Pina Colada. Considering the cost of a room for one night, some decent alcohol consumption, and the big meal at the red meat emporium I felt being squeezed an extra 13 bucks to park my car was a bit insulting especially because if I didn't bother to sleep there it would have been free. All in all it's a great establishment with an attentive staff. Go ahead, splurge and give it a go. It was a fun night and I didn't go to bed hungry! Next stop... the Big Island. Aloha!

<Title>“Ups and downs”
<Content>As we speak, I am staying here at the Gaylord Palms for a company conference. I came a day early, so this first day is "on me", the rest of my visit (2 more days) are on the company. Check in was smooth, I opted for valet parking, even though its 18$ a day (ridiculous, I might add). The check in assistant filled my request for a king room without a hitch, and I was no sooner in my room than someone was calling to ask me was I ready for my baggage. The bellman came up straight away, and while he was in the room, the bell manager was calling to find out if everything was satisfactory. I was very pleased. I was given a room in the St. Augustine section, with a balcony overlooking the atrium. The atrium is amazing, and I spent part of my evening checking it out. I had dinner at Sora--a sushi bar. The prices are VERY high--$8 for a salad of greens only, and $11 for a 4 piece salmon roll. The drinks were 12$ each. I enjoyed shopping, but wouldn't buy anything here--take advantage of your valet parking and drive a few miles down I4 to the Orlando Premium Outlets--you can find the same items a lot cheaper. My room was excellent, although I missed having a minibar. I bought some wine and snacks, having been forewarned by this site. I also brought my laptop, and the free wifi is nice. If you don't have a lap top, each room has an in room computer (part of your resort fee). All, in all, I think it's a great facility for a conference. Would I come again? I don't think so. I'd like to go back to the RitzCarlton at Amelia Island. Not so expensive, and the service was much better.

<Title>“wouldn't stay here if had to pay rack rate.”
<Content>We booked this hotel with www.wdwinfo.com they had a deal for $99.00 night (would not have gone other wise). Hotel is very beautiful, but noisy. We traveled with our 2 year old and struggled to get her to sleep at a resonable hour with all the convetion parties in the atruim. Very close to the parks and that was great. Yes there is a resert fee of $16.95 and parking is $12.00 plus tax but most of the high end resorts or hotels have simular charges. Bed was not all that comfortable and sheets were rather ruff. Remember this is a very large hotel so yes there is a large amount of walking to be done from room to elevator to resturant to parking. This is probably not the hotel for someone with walking difficulties.For the price we paid the hotel was excellent. The resturants are not cheep but the food is very good and for a hotel of this class I thought it very resonable. Over all if you can get this hotel for less than rack rate it is quite a good deal. Would not stay there if had to pay 300+ a night to noisy.

<Title>“A Sensation!”
<Content>My husband had a sales meeting at the Gaylord Palms so my kids and I joined him before spending a few days at Disney. This is the largest property I have even seen. The atrium is breathtaking - alligators, turtles, fish, rivers, waterfalls, streetlights...you name it. Our room was ready upon arrival and it was immaculately clean. Very well appointed and spacious. The pools were lovely, but the kids water park was closed. The shopping and restaurants were great. The staff was very helpful. I would highly recommend this property!

<Title>“Inside the Atrium”
<Content>The Gaylord Palms is a huge hotel located just outside of all the major Disney attractions. Our room was in the St. Augustine section, facing into the hotel, under the atrium. We left our balcony doors open most of the time, although it did get a little loud at times. All of the hotel staff were very polite, but we had some issues ... we asked for an extra hairdryer, they brought us an iron. All of the restaurants located in the hotel are nice, but pricey. We had a few random issues with our bill - charges that should not have been on there, but they were fixed. Our room had a computer with a pretty extensive hotel intranet, including info on our conference, which was great. The theme parts of the hotel were neat and well maintained. Both pools were nice but seemed a little dated and the giant octopus was closed :( Overall, I would give this hotel a 3.5 to 4 stars on a 5 star rating system.

<Title>“Awesome resort!”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at this resort for one night recently. The Gaylord Palms is one of the coolest places I've ever stayed. The entire hotel has a huge atrium in the middle that looks like a jungle. There are tress and plants everywhere and even alligators and turtles. All of the shops, restaurants and bars are inside the atrium among the trees. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants, but we had drinks at a very cool restaurant that is on a boat in a giant pond. The rooms are very nicely appointed and overlook the atrium. They feature free internet access, comfortable beds, double sinks in the bathroom, and a small balcony. The best thing about the resort was the customer service. Even though we booked our room through Hotwire, the front desk employee gave us a room with a king size bed in a great location. Everyone at the resort was very nice. The only drawback were the high prices for food and drinks, but that's not unusual for a hotel. Overall we had a great stay at the Gaylord Palms.

<Title>“An aging property with obscene prices of everything on premises”
<Content>This was my 2nd stay at the Gaylord where I was invited as a convention speaker. I did not have to pay for the room, and the perks were nice (suite, limo), but other than that the property is starting to show its age. The decor feels old, the TVs in the rooms are tiny (really shocking after staying in modern big-city convention hotels), but what really got me were prices of anything other than the room, which as I said was free to me. You cannot have a modest dinner for one, without alcohol, for under $50. A piece of chocolate in the shop that is under $2 in a supermarket, was $6. They really take advantage of those of us without cars.

<Title>“One problem after another”
<Content>My husband was attending a convention held at their convention center. I took the time to call the hotel to book directly (not through the convention) because I wanted to stay in the Emerald Towers. When we arrived I checked in while my husband was taking care of the car and the luggage. I showed them my drivers lic. and gave them my husband's corporate credit card, since this was a business trip. Although the desk acknowledged that I requested the Emerald Tower, they put us in the Key West section. The room was terrible. The closet consisted of an indentation in the wall from which a 1 foot long rod was mounted on one side, about 4 feet from the floor. The bath room shower consisted of a shower curtain hung across on end of the bath room and a drain in the middle. No lip to prevent the water from covering the entire bathroom floor. The view from our postage stamp balcony was of very large ship in a very small man made pond, which was their fish rest. At about 3pm extremely loud entertainment began on the deck of the ship/rest. That was it, I called the front desk. After telling them we were checking out, they found another room and moved us to the Everglades section. The room in the Everglades was much much better. It was larger better appointed, relatively quiet, had a real closet, had a real shower and decent bathroom. The second day we were there my husband went off at a business meeting and I decided to return to the room on my own. My key did not work in the door and the maids were not in the hall. I went down to the desk and asked them to replace my key. The desk told me that I was not registered. They asked for my drivers lic., said they could send a security guard up to the room to let me in, but could not give me a key unless my husband came to the desk to authorize it. Now remember I am the one who checked in. The desk never asked nor saw any of my husband's identification. I asked for a manager. An assistant manager came out. She said she was so sorry so sorry, the clerk make a mistake at check in, by not registering me in the room, however I had to get my husband to come to the desk in order to correct the matter. She told me to ask for her when I could reach him and she would get the matter straightened out immediately. Less than 20 minutes, my husband now out of his meeting, called me to tell me he was free. He was not too happy when I told him he had to come down to the desk so I could get a key to our room. He met me there and I asked the person at the front desk to get the assistant manager that I had spoken to before. The message came back that she was too busy to come out from the back. Fortunately a very kind desk clerk who had over heard all that went on earlier came to our rescue. They do not have enough dinning options for dinner on the premises. They have only one pretty small steakhouse, which is had to get in unless you eat before 6pm or after 9pm. Their continental rest. is buffet, which I hate, and their seafood rest. has very LOUD music, so you have to go off premises to eat. Although it is supposed to be completely non-smoking. My husband and I were in the hot tub at the pool, and two women came over parked themselves down and proceeded to smoke. They did not even bother to ask if we minded the smoke. There is no pool staff so no one is there to enforce their no smoking rules. My husband and I just picked up our things and left, it was easier. All in all it was a very unpleasant stay. You do not get the rooms in the section you request, no matter how you make your reservation, and the sections are not equal.

<Title>“Do not do it if a convention is going on!”
<Content>Beautiful hotel but all kinds of problems. Went there for a short honeymoon and upon entering there were drunk convention goers everywhere. I booked a king bed in the Emerald bay section and got two full beds in the key west section with a view of the guest parking lot that you pay around 15 per day to park in. Then the people next door that were there for a convention partied till 4:30 in the morning! And at the end of it all I got hit with a resort fee around 15 per day! And if you order room service 22% gratuity added in. If there is a convention there, stay away.

<Title>“A city unto itself.”
<Content>The first thing you'll notice about Gaylord Palms is it's size. It is huge! With the foliage and features under the main dome you won't be able to see from one side to the other and it's difficult to get your bearings. If you're going for a few days you'll probably not learn the lay of the land so use the directory in front and the signs that are posted to help you around. With its size brings many indoor features. There's a number of restaurants and bars (including Sunset Sam's with its own boat, an Italian eatery and a steakhouse), specialty shops, and a Haagen Dasz, among others. There is a lot of habitat in the main courtyard. They keep young gators on site which you can watch get fed. A lot of fish and turtles, too. I believe I saw a stingray in the pond by Sunset Sam's. We stayed in the Emerald Bay area -- 3rd floor. The rooms were clean and included their own computer, although the internet is slooooow. One of the pillowcases had a black smudge on it but it was replaced. BTW, there is no traditional "Do Not Disturb" sign. There's a couple of buttons by the door; one that turns on a "Do Not Disturb" light. The reason I mention this is that if you forget to turn it off when you leave for the day they'll pass over your room for cleaning. Since I'm used to having a sign to hang on the door, I forgot the first day. But no biggie. There are two outdoor pools... one for family and one for adults only. The family pool is working on a mini waterpark which (if I read the banner correctly) will be completed at the end of February. Both pools use salt water. There are a few hot tubs around the pools, as well as an outdoor bar (H2O). For the most part, I liked the Gaylord Palms. Its a neat place and very close to Disney. Some of the problems I noticed were: --Like I mentioned earlier, internet in the rooms is slow. --A number of the games in the arcade were broken but not indicated as such. --From where we were staying, it was a long walk to the parking lot. --Service at the boat bar at Sunset Sam's was poor (but that was one bartender and may not be indicative of the entire staff). I'd still recommend it.

<Title>“If you love paying fees and charges, you'll love the Gaylord”
<Content>Booked it through Priceline for $100 a night for a stay at Disney. Be prepared to pay $13 for self-parking and a $17 resort fee. The resort fee includes fitness center use, free theme park shuttle, and 2 bottled waters. We were told by 2 different employees where to catch the shuttle but they were both wrong and we missed it. After calling the concierge and explaining the situation, they got a us a personal driver to take us to Epcot...this made up for the misinformation and almost justified the extra fees (it's $70 to get a driver to pick you up from the airport and $55 to get back). Overall, it was a very nicely appointed room in the Emerald Bay section but I was expecting a little nicer. Would only stay here again if they got rid of the parking and resort fees.

<Title>“What a trip?”
<Content>We had the privilege to stay at the Gaylord from January 2-January 5 2008. Upon arrival we were impressed by the size of the facility and the beautiful decorations in the lobby. Our check in was quick and there was no mention of using Priceline to book the room. Our request of an atrium view was quickly granted. The Gaylord atrium view is preferred compared to a garden view or a view of Walt Disney World which results in looking across I-4 and no balcony. Upon check in we learned that the Palms was hosting a holiday scavenger hunt for the gnomes of Travelocity.com that had been hidden throughout the hotel grounds. Upon arriving in the room we opened the doors to the balcony and were awestruck by the beauty below. I would recommend choosing a room above the third floor to prevent your view being blocked by the lush vegetation. We were quickly off to play bocci ball on the bocci court, followed by some mini golf, and then a game of croquet which are located on property. Everyday as part of the resort fee there are two Dasani waters placed in your fridge and you can go to a neighboring golf course to hit a free bucket of range balls. The Gaylord Palms sets the standard for what a resort should be and is where we will be staying the next time we are in Orlando.

<Content>This is a large hotel, and atrium-facing rooms can be a bit noisy, but overall I had a great experience here. Rooms were clean and well appointed. Beds were very comfortable. Public areas of the hotel were well maintained. Onsite restaurants are on the expensive side, but the seafood restuarant, the steakhouse and the buffet were all very good. Overall, I was pleased and I would gladly stay here again.

<Title>“Monstrosity near Disney”
<Content>I stayed at the Gaylord Palms in Kissimmee for the BICSI Winter Conference. The convention center was the best part of the resort. I am not a huge fan of enormous hotels, and the Gaylord Palms is enormous to say the least. The lobby is actually not that intimidating, with the long check-in area to the right and the modern bar on the left, but once you move forward into the huge indoor area, you're thrown into a world of multiple themed zones that include sailboats and alligators. There are several restaurants: I only ate at the buffet and the food was average at best. Some people who were there with me ate at the Steakhouse and enjoyed it. There is a sports bar outside near the pools and a Piano Bar which was packed every evening. Both provide decent entertainment without having to drive anywhere, which if you have been to Orlando before, can be an adventure. The room I had was in the Everglades section overlooking the inside and all the inside rooms have doors and a balcony so if you were so inclined, you could sit and watch everything going on inside the area. The rooms were decent, but not upgraded anytime in the recent past. A small, older, tube television was inside an armoire with a safe and mini fridge. The bathroom accomodations were decent as well. Overall, if you are going to a convention at the Gaylord Palms Convention Center, it's probably a good idea to stay there. Also, if you have young children and are hitting up the Disney parks, the resort is very close to them. It is also situated in a nice area, right off both I-4 and Osceola Parkway, so it is easy to navigate the area without using the major highways.

<Title>“Absolutely Gorgeous”
<Content>What a beautiful hotel! We arrived very late New Years Eve 1:00 a.m. (Jan 1st) and we had great service at the registration desk. We got a beautiful King room in the St Augustine area and the view from our balcony was breathtaking. The moment you stepped out onto the balcony, you could smell the flowers and the plants. It was so relaxing. We had no problems what so ever. We loved having access to a computer and we were able to converse with our kids at home everyday through email. We did have a problem with our TV which they totally just replaced within an hour. The Old Hickory Steakhouse is well worth treating yourself to. It is pricey, but well worth it. The shopping is not abundant, but what they have was good enough for me. The weather was not great when we were there, so we did not get to spend much time at the pool, but it was beautiful no less. Just to walk through the atrium was a relaxing experience in itself. We would definately stay again and would recommend this hotel to anyone. Any charges that we had we were made well aware of through Expedia so there were no surprises. Absolutely loved it., we were sorry to have to leave, and hope to be able to return one day.

<Title>“Great hotel but...”
<Content>We are family of three went during the Christmas week. It is one of the best hotels in the neighborhood. The room was decent with king bed. NO bath tub and shower cap provided though. Hotel's 24hr cafe was convenient, but pricey. Walking around the hotel was one of the must do. The alligators, the walkway & shops are all beautiful, just like the illustrated pictures. Staff were friendly and helpful. They charged $11+tax /day for parking (multiple entries). $12 +tax /day for resort fee. So even we got a great deal from Expedia.ca, we ended up paying extra $148 when checked out. We used the express checkout terminal, as well the express web flight check-in located in the lobby area. They were super time saver. If you come for ICE, better go during weekdays, it is $5 cheaper per adult. At the front desk, there were brochures and on the back there is $3/adult discount. No price discount to book on line. We bought our admission right at the entrance located in the convention center of the hotel. The whole ICE experience was great if you have never seen ice sculpture in this scale before. My 9 yr old son loved the ICE slide. The mini fridge in room was kind of small. We filled it up with bottled waters for our disney 4 days trip.

<Title>“If you desire quiet, don't stay in Emerald Bay section!”
<Content>The resort website would not allow me to book a suite or ICE package. I needed to call them directly and successfully made reservations for an ICE package. It was necessary to prepay but did give a reasonable time to cancel if needed. I stressed my request for a quiet location within the resort, after some coaching from a friend who has stayed there. Upon checking in, I again asked if our suite was located in a quiet area. I was assured we were upgraded and given a map with the elevator location. Our suite was lovely with a balcony that overlooked the huge atrium. The marble bath was luxurious but the shower proved to have a design problem with water flowing through the door every time used. Repeated requests made for repair were ignored. We used more towels to soak up the water and therefore prevented any reuse of towels and being a Green friendly guest. The bed linens were disappointing. Nicer bedding is found at a Marriott Courtyard. Our suite was next to a glass elevator and proved to be very noisy. The angles of the construction created an illusion of not being close to the elevator, so beware! Request Key West area, may be more quiet.

<Title>“Average At Best”
<Content>My wife and I went to the Gaylord Palms for a pre-Christmas getaway two weeks prior to the 2007 holiday. Upon arriving at the hotel from our home in Jacksonville the line for valet parking was so long that it took 30 minutes to get to the hotel entrance. When we enter the hotel to check-in we are greeted with another long line to check-in which takes another 30 minutes. When we finally get to our room we find that the room we reserved was not the room we received and was actually one of the lesser expensive rooms that we had paid a premium price for. Upon calling the front-desk and getting to someone who could correct the error we were at first met with resistance and informed that the hotel was completely booked up for the weekend and there were no more rooms. After a short wait we were informed that we would be given a suite to compensate for the error but it was on the other side of the hotel and we would have to go back to the front desk to have the registration switched. The suite was nice but the decor of the suite and the hotel in general were disappointing for a $250 per night room. When we went to the various Palms restaurants that evening for dinner all were booked up. It would have been nice to have known this upon check-in so other plans could have been made. All and all even after taking into consideration that the hotel was handling holiday engagements the hotel was a disappointment.

<Title>“A truly Unique Experience.”
<Content>We went here for the ICE attraction. We are Florida residents and still just loved it. As an out of state tourist, you'll expect the prices. In state. . .a little wallet shocked. The room itself was moderately priced. We bought the Best of Florida ICE package. And will do so again in the future. The ICE attractions was AMAZING. The hotel itself is Amazing. Living in Florida, I was still impressed with the Key West, St. Augustine and Everglade Atriums - all "inside." The themed resort is exciting and clever, however everything is quite a walk. 'But really, that's the fun of it. The food is great, but EXTREMELY overpriced. There seem to be a bit of hidden charges, so please asked for all of that up front. Gaylord Palms houses a top rate Spa ( a reason to go back). The kids loved this place. We loved it as well. You can leave the site to go search for food elsewhere, but it is inconvenient and easier to eat "in." But you're paying for the choice. I would suggest going to the local Arabian Nights attraction. A Dinner show worth the funds.

<Title>“Weirdly Good”
<Content>I was weirdly pleased with the Gaylord Palms. I had no expectations...my relatives had booked it for an overnight stay after picking me up from MCO. It's a huge property with a lot going on. The pros... If you've got kids, there seemed to be a lot to keep them occupied. They had hid 16 gnomes across the property and there was a contest to find them. There were alligator feedings and a huge ice show (as in ice shaped like things--I had low expectations and I was pretty entertained by this). The gym looked awesome. One of the best I've seen in a hotel. Very big. Our rooms came with PCs with Internet access. For free. Good deal. Lots of eating options. We ate at the Key West place and it was pleasant. The steak place looked more atmospheric and interesting. But pricey. The breakfast buffet was amazing but get there early. The line was out the door at 10. There's also a 24 hour coffee shop on premises. The cons The wait for our car after we checked out at 11 was horrible. 45 minutes. I wish we hadn't valet'd it. The whole world checked out at 11 and was in the same situation. The hotel couldn't cope. People were crying and complaining that the hotel was holding their cars hostage. (Granted this was just 2 of the 30 some-odd people waiting.) There wasn't a bar. Restaurants, yes. Bar, no. I felt like I was tipping people left and right. Anyhow, I'd stay again if I found the need. Rooms were clean and neat. Staff were friendly and hospitable.

<Title>“Complete package”
<Content>I am a married 25 year old female. My husband and I have stayed at the Orlando Gaylord Palms on many occasions and each time we are more then satisfied with our stay. We only stay for pleasure and have even brought our 7 month old along. We find the staff always more then willing to please and the rooms are always well maintained. We only stay in the Emerald Bay or Saint Augustine theme sections and have the atrium views. I have also had a massage at the Canyon Ranch spa each time I have stayed. I do find the room, spa services, and food to be pricey however the superior service I have received at each of my visits makes me happy to pay. I love that I have everything I want under one roof. When staying at a resort of this caliber you expect certain details I find Gaylord Palms delivers. They do so with their in room networking of computer systems I never have to pick up the phone for room service or maid services. The restaurants in the atrium are a good mix of cuisines.

<Title>“Internet for the Business Traveler”
<Content>Overall my stay was excellent. However I think the hotel should have more internet access. I had to check out of my room at 11 am and had 2 hours before I could my ride to the airport. I ask the Concierge about a WiFi hotspot while I wait. I was informed in a cold, efficient manner that the only way I could do this was to hike over to the business center and pay $0.69 per Minute to do this.

<Title>“Another late night”
<Content>.I am staying at the Gaylord Palms for 4 nights attending a conference. When I checked in I was asked if I minded some music near my room that would last until 10 PM. I said no. The room was actually over the bar. So yes the live music ended at 10PM but, the taped music and loud voices go on till all hours. This hotel is a large atrium style hotel so if you have an interior room you are screwed (unless of course you sit in the bar all night). On top of that the construction is poor so when people leave their room in the early AM and let the door slam, my door jiggled back and forth and the wall shook. Bottom line is no sleep AM or PM. I called the front desk repeatedly to get my room changed. They told me I was “on a list”. I never heard from them in 4 days. The room quality is so so. Bed linen is 100% polyester and in room computer terminal works like a toy. When I plugged in the hairdryer it started smoking. I left a note for housekeeping and they did replace it. The food is good and the people are generally very pleasant. Cost wise about $200 for the room, a call drink is $11 at the bar, they charge a resort fee of $10 a day and self-parking is $12. If I wasn’t attending a conference here I would never have chosen this resort. I have stayed at Marriott’s, the Ritz and a new condo resort, Vista Cay (very nice place) on other visits to Orlando and never had a problem like this. My advice is if you do stay here get a room that faces the street but, with all the choices in Orlando you can do better than Gaylord!

<Title>“Absolutely awful...”
<Content>I booked two rooms for my employee and I for a industry convention being hosted at the Gaylord in Kissimmee, Florida. Our stay was 5 days. Having spent time at the Dallas Gaylord property, I was a bit familiar with the hotel brand. Having a some what pleasurable experience at the Dallas Gaylord, I was anticipating my stay at the Kissimmee Gaylord to be similar. Let me preface that as a frequent business traveler I am accustomed to a level of acceptable practices, chief among them, a clean and sanitiary room. Although I cannot expect perfection, for what my room rate was (even at a reduced cost through the convention) I had tremendous difficulties with many issues during my stay. To begin, as soon as I checked into my room I immediately noticed ripped wall paper in the common space areas and dirty carpet in my room. As I browsed the washroom and toilet areas I found a dirty towel in the bath tub and the shampoo amenity was half full. It smelled of sewer each and every time the toilet was flushed and of sulfur each and every time I used the shower. The shower pressure was also pathetically low and the water didn't drain properly in the tub. I stood in 4 inches of dirty water every night to get clean. The towels offered desperately need to be replaced. Many of the ones I was provided with were horribly worn with random threads dangling from the stiched seams. My dog is dryed with better towels than the ones I was given. Simply ridiculous. The bedding is aged and the pillows are depressingly thin and offer no support. The mini bar is not stocked with anything, but you are left with a nice message on a bed card letting you know that if you purchase at least $20 worth of product, they will happily stock the refrigerator for you. Completely ridicuous. The room thermostat is limited. It doesn't enable you to go beyond 75 degrees. If a guest needs to feel warmer for whatever reason, that decision should be left to them and their comfort level. Totally wrong. Transporation outside of the facility is limited to the use of pre-selected town cars only. Taxi cabs are not permitted to enter the property except to drop you off from the airport. During my stay town car fees ranged from $25-$35 one way. Total nonsense. With a resort of this size, one would think there would be a wonderful selection of fine dining and easy casual restaurants. Not the case. There are less than 5 mediocre eateries on the premises. The food at Villa de Flora could have been so much better. Super dissapointed. Contained within a dome of controlled air conditioning and pressure, and with no real activities on the premises there is literally nothing to do. All in all my experience was terrible and I would never recommend anyone come here for casual vacationing. It is clear that the management company is focused to one thing. Convention revenue. With as many of these issues during once visit, it's pretty clear that they are not too concerned about guest comfort. I unfortunately experienced this place through the course of business and will happily declare that I will never return to another Gaylord again...

<Title>“Nothing special”
<Content>I must disagree with most of the reviews. I just stayed at this property this past weekend on a "romance" package with an Atrium view room ($400.00+ booked online). For the money there are much nicer properties in the area with much better service. First impression upon entering the property - I opted for self parking ($12.00/day) and after droping my wife off at the main entry, I found no clear signs to the entrance to the parking lot (signs take you to the exit which is not maked as an exit but gated so you cannot enter). Once I got the car situated there were no signs from the parking lot back to the lobby for check in. I walked the long way, up and down stairs through the atrium - I later discovered that the signs I finally found in the atrium took me the long way around. When we checked in we were given no information about our package or how to arrange for the various elements of it. I thought maybe there would be a package for us in the room or someone would call. There wasn't and they didn't. Eventually I called guest services and I was given at least partially wrong information. In the room we found a used toothpick on the bed which made me wonder about the quality of housekeeping. The room itself, though adequate, was nothing special and was somewhat shabby (the carpet had holes, the upholstery on the chairs was stained, the bedding drab and of mediocre quality, the furniture had scratches and the television was old with varying qualities of reception on the various channels - some came in good, some had static). I couldn't get a reservation in the steak restaurant for dinner (at a decent time) so opted for the seafood restaurant. Part of our package was a "wine and cheese flight" for two at the steakhouse restaurant. We went there prior to dinner to have our wine and cheese flight for two in the bar. We were given a wine and cheese flight for one. I asked about this when we were given only one set of glasses. The waitress explained this was what we were to get as per her manager. The manager came over and explained that we were only to get the wine and cheese flight for one as this was more romantic. When we arrived at the seafood restaurant for dinner they didn't have a reservation under my name. They had a name somewhat close so I'll assume they just misunderstood. They did seat us right away but not in the restaurant. They seated us in the bar area - (not being familiar with the restaurant I didn't realize this until later - nor were we told by anyone that we were being seated in the bar). Being in the bar area was not too big of a deal until the band started playing - five feet away from us - about 20 minutes into our meal - too late for us to get up and leave. That was the end of any possibility of conversation or even being able to hear the waitress. Instead of a romantic anniversary dinner we were in the middle of Margaritaville. We rushed through the meal and got out of there asap. Back in the room we found that the muzak they pipe into the atrium (which was like various ambiant tones repeated one after another) leaked into the room in an endless cycle and was annoying to say the least. Thankfully it was shut off at about 11:00 PM. There was a lot of outside noise from kids and teens running around the halls and slamming doors til all hours but I understand it is a resort area and there's going to be some of that almost anywhere you go. Room service breakfast guaranteed for 30 delivery (or its free) took 45. Couldn't take advantage of the guarantee as breakfast was included in the package. I wonder if that had anything to do with the late delivery. (BTW, room service breakfast - 2 entrees 2 large juices over $60.00 with service and delivery fees - good thing it was included). Having a computer with internet access in the room was nice. In checking my account, I found several incorrect charges on our bill which had to be corrected. Staff was very nice in addressing problems but problems kept coming up. On a one night stay, at least 4 charges in error which had to be corrected. Wife had massage at the spa and, due to spa's mix up, she was given someone else's treatment - and they got hers. Spa gave her a discount but still. It was one mistake and mix up after the other. I wouldn't return to this property and couldn't recommend it.

<Title>“A Vegas type hotel in Florida without the casino”
<Content>We needed one night prior to flying home to the UK after a Disney and Gulf Coast 2 week stay and I was allocated the Gaylord on Priceline for $111. We had a great day and didn't really use all the facilities but the room was great, We had dinner at the Keys restaurant and that was fantastic . Especially the magician and lady on stilts who amused our kids!! The room was big the complex very clean. The only disappointment is that they charge you a resort fee of $10 a day and its mandatory. Come Gaylord either drop it or put it on the room charge. Don't give your guests bad surprises!!

<Title>“a Big, Likeable Place”
<Content>I liked it as it was an interesting resort. It also rained for 3 straight days and we were at a conference so life walking between the convention hall and the rooms was very pleasant. It's about a 20 minute ride from the airport via taxi and costs @$45. Couple of transporation services also run the route. If you like to be w/ 5-8 people in a bus, pick your poison and halve the cost of a taxi. First impression is BIGGGG! Looks like 1800 rooms w/ a convention hall attached and it's look is impressive and it's a nice place overall. Check in was fast, very well staffed and it was 11pm when I was checking in. Room was on first floor (try for a higher floor to reduce noise) and the room was big, clean and had a nice size balcony on it. Faced the interior where they have a ton of great restaurants, coffee house, ice cream parlor and retail shops and it's all done very well. Ate at the buffet lunch place one day that is directly in the middle of the atrium and frankly, it was great. Lots of vegetables, salads, grilled stuff and just a very good lunch place for $20 pp. Hotel operators for wake-up calls and every other of my requests were terrific, helpful and went out of their way to answer my questions. They give you a map to get @ and you need it. Bathroom was big, whole setup was clean, shampoo and stuff was top notch and plenty of hot water in the morn. I stayed in the Everglades section of the hotel and it did have mosquitos or small fleas when I sat on the balcony one night. Another reason to get a higher up room. First floor also had lots of noise in the morning including the guy who left the USA Today and you could hear them plopping, room by room as he went down the hall. Looked like they had plenty of transporation to/from Disney... just a really big, likeable place.

<Title>“Amazing resort experience”
<Content>Booked a one-night Bed and Breakfast package direct with the hotel for $259 before tax, which included a Florida view room, Resort fee and breakfast for two at Villa de Flora inside the hotel. This is more than I am usually willing to pay for a hotel, but having been here before for a business convention, I felt strongly that my fiance would wholly enjoy the experience. I was not mistaken. This location can often be had via Priceline for about $99 before tax, but was sold out for the last two nights of my stay, so I opted for a direct book for the night I could get. With that said, we were upgraded to an Atrium view (an absolute must to truly appreciate what the Gaylord Palms has to offer) in the St. Augustine area upon request, having indicated on my reservation that it was our anniversary. This would have cost us $40 more per night, and would have been worth it. I had a Florida view last time around and it made the hotel feel generic. Having the ability to open the French Doors to the balcony overlooking the Atrium is a great perk. The Key West section of the hotel is noisier than the Everglades section, so opt for a room near there if you prefer the sound of waterfalls rather than music from the bar. I am not sure what I can add (other than my pictures) that has not already been said before, but I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted a place to stay in the Orlando area. Service is wonderful, the room was immaculate and the experience is just one of a kind. If you are two adults looking to get away, there is an adults-only pool, a safe haven from splashing and screaming kids. For families, there is also a kid-friendly pool. I just got a kick out of walking around the Atrium area, checking out the fish and other wildlife and poking into the various shops available. If budget is not a concern, there is no need to leave this hotel, as everything you need is here, along with complimentary service to all area attractions. Sunset Sam's is the most reasonable restaurant, and I would recommend it for lunch as you can easily get out of there for under $20 per person. Villa de Flora is $19 per person for breakfast, which is buffet style; other meals there increase by about $5 from there. The steakhouse is a budget buster for most, but the ambiance is almost priceless. I'd say you are looking at about $60 per person to dine there. By the looks of things, reservations are recommended. Based on my memory from my business-orient trip, the food at the steakhouse is nothing to write home about. However, it was great place to take in the sights and sounds, and kick back with friends over a decent meal. I'd skip desert at the restaurants and stop into the Java Cafe (24 hours) for a pastry or Haagen Daaz (open until 11 p.m.). Either one will be easier on the wallet and likely be more satisfying. In sum, the Gaylord Palms is an experience in and of itself. For someone who has never been here before, I'd say 2 or 3 nights is ideal. 1 night is not enough, even for someone who has been there before...I never wanted to leave, and the 5-star Hyatt Grand Cypress is, in my opinion, a much lesser hotel than the Gaylord Palms.

<Title>“Stay here, you'll love it”
<Content>Loved it! This resort was so much fun. It's a big convention hotel so if you are ok with that then this is the place. The atrium was great to walk around, it's like you are at various destinations. The pool was nice. I stayed at a lot of other hotels in Orlando and this one is by far the best. Stay here.

<Title>“Fun, expensive property with great pool, nice location”
<Content>The atrium is the big draw and it is nice to have somewhere to go and walk when you're at this sort of conference hotel that's not within walking distance of anything else. It's very impressive (palm trees, orchids, ferns, etc.) and very well-maintained, and I liked the alligators and fish in all the water features. My room was in the corner where the St. Augustine section meets the Everglades area, and that was nice - I had the warm colors of the St. Augustine room (which was great, since the hotel follows standard Florida practice of being arctic in its air conditioning) and the beauty of the Everglades area (also, proximity to the adult pool.) There's a printed walking tour of the atrium available from the concierge, and that's fun if you've got spare time. Make sure to ride the glass elevators, especially the everglades one, for a full view. The pools are impressive - the adult only pool is huge, and heated and peaceful, with plenty of lounge chairs and tables, and an enormous cabin-like building containing the best hotel towels I've ever seen, actually large enough to use as wraparound towels. The little poolside (actually, just outside the main entrance to the pool) was rarely open, but I did see employees bringing people food from the H20 grill, which is a bit further away. Also beside the pool entrance was one of those big water dispensers, crammed full of ice and sweating mightily in the sun. The water was always ice cold. There are cabanas near the pool, but they're a bit set off and nobody seemed to use them; maybe they're there for functions. Speaking of which - the adult pool had two main gates, and the second one (nearest my room) seemed to have a permanent sign "Pool will be closed from 8am-2pm for private function" but there never was one; the pool was always open and I never saw a function. The pool is swim-at-your-own-risk, and open 24 hours. The children's pool appeared to be under construction; it was open but the octopus slide was blocked, and that general area was being worked on. The steakhouse is very expensive, but delicious steaks. The seafood place did a very nice cheeseburger and flavored iced tea. And having a Haagen-Dazs in the hotel was fun. The room service is quick and useful, available 24 hours, and expensive. The pizza's gummy, but the fries are good (I believe they were both from H2O). There are snacks available in a sort of general store near the walkway over to the conference center. This is a well-equipped store with snacks, sodas, (if you're a Pepsi fan, it's all Coke products), business products, magazines, gift items, etc. There's a little boutique nearby that has upscale gifts. There's also a couple of clothing stores, and a Disney store where you can buy theme park tickets and souvenirs. The transportation lobby has a Hertz rental desk, handy for when you snap and realize that you have to get off-property before you go stir crazy, and a Universal Theme Parks rep who can sell you tickets to that set of parks, and give you tips about the shuttles. There are free shuttles to Disney, Universal and Sea World. They are handy because the cab fares are atrocious. Also atrocious is the hotel's parking situation; I have no problem paying for parking in the city, but I am amazed that a hotel in the middle of nowhere, whose nearest neighbors are a herd of beef cattle and a highway, actually charges people to park. They do take wonderful care of the property, and I suppose it makes the place more secure to monitor parking. A few additional points - the snakes mentioned elsewhere are in a few well-fastened aquariums in the little 'shack' structure in the Everglades section of the atrium. This area also has the baby alligator display, and they're cute when they're little. The hotel's grounds are beautiful and ferociously kept up, and the whole place looks very nice. The details were a little shabbier. The room safe didn't work, and took a lot of maneuvering for the hotel to fix. Two lamps in my room had electricity problems, and when I was doing a pre-checkout sweep under the beds, I found a child's toy, a mini candy bar, and several other objects clearly left by previous inhabitants. The TV cabinet/bureau had a crack in it. Mostly, though, it was a nice place. The empty minifridge was great, you can fill it with whatever you buy outside to keep from eating out every meal (there's a Super Target a few miles down 192, so if you have a rental car, go get supplies; their Cuban bread is excellent) and the in-room computer and internet access was fantastic. I wish all hotels came with a free internet-ready computer. The people were mostly very pleasant.

<Title>“Awesome hotel, a steal through Priceline!”
<Content>This is the nicest hotel I've ever visited. The customer service was excellent, but maybe that is because we weren't very picky. There was an employee waiting to open our doors when we pulled up. He helped us unload our luggage and sent us to the front desk with a ticket. Since it was our first visit to the hotel they upgraded us to a room with an interior balcony for free. The room was clean and very spacious. The bathroom was very nice with double sinks, and we had great water pressure in the shower. It was nice to have a mini fridge, especially with a baby. We called down for a crib and it arrived with our luggage in about 15 minutes. It was the best crib we have seen at a hotel, usually we get those crappy playpens. The hotel is very large and there is a lot to see. I did not feel the decor was cheesy at all. It seemed very upscale to me, as were the prices. We paid $13 for a hamburger at the seafood restaurant. Forget about room service. Even though we got the room for $95/night, we couldn't afford to do anything there, but it was totally worth the wonderful stay. The hotel is very close to disney, you can even see it from the entrance to the theme park property. Parking was $12 per day in the hotel parking lot. Even though they had computers in the rooms, we brought our own laptops and while they do have high speed internet access, they don't have wireless.

<Title>“Great Stay”
<Content>I attended a conference for three nights and really liked this hotel. The only bad experience I had was checking in. We reserved a king bed months ago and they gave us 2 double beds because there were no available rooms with a king bed. Well, when we got to the room, the safe was broken along with everything else in the room. We had laptops and expensive equipment with us and needed to have the safe working (at least). Anyway, we called the front desk and advised them that we were disappointed and we were given another room. The second room was in the Emerald section, 8th floor and it had a king bed with working safe!!. We were much happier with this room. Housekeeping is excellent- rooms very clean!! The pools are great and heated. The south beach pool is very quiet. I found the meeting facilities to be great and the spa prices expensive. Parking at $12 is ridiculous- even if you park there for an hour, it is still $12. That is an absolute ripoff. Also, they charge you a $10 per day resort fee (mandatory) which gives you two bottled waters per day and newspaper. The food/buffett at Villa de Flora is excellent and not to be missed. It is a great price $28pp for dinner. I enjoyed my stay here, but would not recommend this place to families.

<Title>“Very Disney”
<Content>My husband and I stayed for 4 nights during a business conference, in Sept. Cons-When registering for the room via phone we asked for a king bed, when we arrived we were given 2 queens. We were told that there were no king rooms available that night but that they might be able to move us to a king room the following day. A coworker checked in a couple of hours after us and he received a king room. He was traveling alone! The bedspreads in our room had a hole in it, the carpets were stained and the ceiling fan (a nice touch, if you don’t turn it on) was covered in dust. We were very disappointed in the room. Although the valet service was competent, there was no one to help us to our room with 6 pieces of luggage. There didn’t seem to be enough staff. There were a lot of little things that were irritating, but not quite big enough to complain about. Also, if you want a room facing the interior with a little balcony--it is $40. extra. The restaurants are very expensive and the coffee house made Starbucks look cheap! $2.50 for a regular cup of bad coffee! Also, our room wasn’t cleaned until 4:00 in the afternoon. I saw the maid in the hall at around 10:30, so I took my book and went and found a nice place to read, I had lunch, shopped a little, came back at 2:00 and NO clean room. So, I waited in the room, reading and watching TV --the maid didn’t show up until 4:00. That was totally unacceptable to me! One of our restaurant reservations got screwed up and the host actually had the nerve to act as if it might be our fault! Hummm… There isn’t much to do in the hotel, there are pools and a spa, but it can get pretty boring—rent a car! Pros-we were moved to a king room the next day, the room was much cleaner, and bigger, it had an awesome shower and clean carpet, however the ceiling fan was still dusty! We had a corner room with 2 windows which was great for the light. There was a computer in the room, a refrigerator and a safe, also an iron and ironing board and a coffee maker. Those amenities are important to me. There a handful of little boutique type gift shops, watch the prices though, you can find most of the items at the local malls for less money. Speaking of malls—if you are a shopper there are a couple of fantastic malls within minutes of the hotel, there is also an outlet mall, but the weather was so hot and humid we waited until evening when it was a little cooler to visit it. All in all for a hotel of this size and caliber, I expected better customer service--you kind of feel that once they get you there—you’re on your own. Everything is over priced and you just don’t get that warm fuzzy feeling. The décor is a little Disney/cheesy but it’s OK. I liked the waterfalls, koi and baby alligators. Would I stay here again? Maybe, if someone else were paying for it!.

<Content>I stayed here with my husband for a sales convention. The service at the hotel was first rate. At check-in, we were upgraded to an executive suite. The room was large and spotless. The adults only South Beach pool was the perfect place to relax. I recommend the hot tub next to the pool. It's open all night.

<Title>“Huge, well-run, touristy but nice”
<Content>We stayed at the hotel for a family wedding, which was held on the property. While the hotel is laid out around a very theme park-like atrium celebrating the various attributes of the State of Florida, the effect is tastefully done and the public spaces are large and welcoming. I recommend booking a room that looks into one of the atriums - we chose Key West and had a balcony with nice view of the pretend lagoon and its sailing ship. Hey, it's Orlando - relax and enjoy the play-acting! Noise is not much of an issue as all entertainment is ended at 10pm, unless your room was right over one of the restaurants, I suppose. BTW for those considering a wedding here, it was lovely and the food at the reception was delicious. If you have time to kill while staying here take advantage of the hotel's offer to give you a Town Car ride to their golf course and a bucket of balls with bag of clubs - for free! Other included activities are the health club and bocce and croquet. FYI for little ones - the Octopus Slide at the kids' pool is under renovation. If you don't need a car definitely book the recommended Mears airport shuttle - convenient and cheaper than a cab.

<Title>“great resort”
<Content>Stayed at this property at a large convention. Loved lots of things about it, including that fact that it is a mini city in and of itself. The best thing was that a temperature of 72 degrees is maintained even when it is horrible and humid outside. You feel like you are outside because of the huge glass dome overhead. The italian restaurant is excellent..expensive but all you can eat with a very appealing atmosphere and large variety. The pool is beautiful and the stuctures within the resort. very interesting. There were a couple of negatives...the rooms could be cleaner..ie mould on the shower grab bar. Needs a good deep cleaning. The other neg was the Steak House restaurant. The prices are very high..but even without worrying about price..the food was horrible. The entres come alone..the salad, side dishes are all pricey. The salad was nothing to write home about..even the presentation. The asparagus was raw in a hollaindaise sauce. The cheesecake like a piece of rubber. I would not eat at this restaurant even if price was not an issue.

<Title>“Loved the Gaylord but wouldn't want to stay more than a few days”
<Content>Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Gaylord. My boyfriend had a convention to attend and I was happy to tag along for a few days of relaxation. Wow, this place is huge. It feels like it's its own little city, if that makes sense. We were greeted by the valet staff, who were very friendly and welcoming. They examined our rental car for any dents or scratches before parking it - few hotels do this, but I think it's a really good idea. Linda, the young girl at the front desk checked us in and was just lovely. We asked about paying for an upgrade, and at first she was going to put us in the Key West section of the hotel. Then she thought about it for a minute, and excused herself to go talk with the manager. She told us she was given approval to instead give us a suite in the St. Augustine section. It turns out that I'm soooo glad she did this because I hear the Key West rooms are decorated in loud/bright colors and are located in a noisier section of the hotel. I liked the St. Augustine color schemes - dark and subdued. We took the elevator up to our room on the 7th floor, and at first I was very nervous because it was located RIGHT next to the elevator. Rooms near the elevator are normally the loudest, with people getting on and off all night. However, the way this room is set up is perfect because the living room area of the suite is what faces closest to the hallway, and the bedroom is tucked far away so you don't hear anything! I'm a very light sleeper and extra sensitive to noise (drives me crazy!) and we barely heard a peep during our 3 nights here. Also, the room stays very dark with the curtains closed - great for sleeping in. (We refered to the bedroom as "the cave.") Our suite was huge! It could have easily fit 4 people, comfortably. The bedroom had 2 balconies overlooking the atrium area of the hotel. Our bed was really comfortable and had a nice desk with computer, (included in the $10 resort fee) lounge chair, closet and refrigerator. Bathroom was a good size with nice "stone" tiled shower (no bath tub) and two sinks. The living area was huge also, with a dining room table, couch, coffee table, sink and another refrig. We spent no time in it, unfortunately. I loved the fact that they had an "adults only pool!" No, that doesn't mean it was topless, ha ha. It means that anyone who uses it needs to be over 18. This avoids lots of little kids running around, splashing, etc. for those adults who want to relax and have some quiet time. Don't worry, the kiddies have their own pool complete with a cool dragon slide - thingy. Drink service at the pool was a bit slow, but they were busy with the convention going on. The gator pond they have in the atrium of the hotel was very cool! There were different types of turtles and koi fish, as well. Very fun to watch and take pics. Yes, you will pay a LOT to eat and drink at this hotel. Our first night, we ate at the sports bar because we were tired from our flight and just wanted something quick. We each had 2 cocktails, shared a cheese and mushroom pizza (tasted no better than a $5 microwave pizza, by the way) and a shrimp salad, and our bill with tip was just over $90! Very spendy and not good quality. No atmosphere either, unless you count the numerous t.v.'s blaring in the background. A large vanilla latte at the coffee shop was almost $6. Absurd!!! And their idea of "large" appears to be a little off...Looked more like a medium to me. We ate a couple of lunches and dinners catered by Gaylord because of the convention. Food was good, not wonderful. Nice salads and dessert selection, but most of the foods that were supposed to be hot, were consistently NOT. All employees we encountered were friendly and a few of them really went above and beyond what you would expect. Overall, I did enjoy the Gaylord but was ready to leave after 3 days. The place is just so huge, and the fact that you are enclosed in glass, "Biosphere style," can be a bit much to take after awhile. But I will say that it is definitely one of the quieter rooms I've ever stayed in, so that was for sure a plus.

<Title>“Amazing facility & rooms but not really convenient for vacationers”
<Content>Myself and about 30 colleagues stayed here during an industry convention. Unfortuantely we had to share rooms, but that's how life is when you work for a small company. My first reaction of this hotel upon arrival was "wow- it's huge". For those who dislike large, you'll definitely hate this place. Parking was kind of a nightmare here - the parking lot is huge, and they charge you $10 and change per day even if you're a guest. I think that's kind of rediculous considering this is a 4-star hotel with plenty of parking spaces. I ended up being blocked out of the main lot by a line of cars waiting to exit, so I had to park near the convention center, which was a 10-minute walk to the front desk. Check-in was fine, although it took a while for the front desk clerk to find my name among all of my co-workers. The front desk was very well staffed with what appeared to be 10+ agents. There was no wait at 4PM on a Sunday, and the clerk was friendly. The hotel rooms are divided into four themed sections. Our room was in the Key West area, which featured bright carpeting, comforters, and the like. Because we had asked for a rollaway bed for our third roommate, the front desk assigned us to an "oversized" room, which definitely was a good size. However, the room overlooked the parking lot and roof, while most of my other co-workers got balcony rooms overlooking the atrium (definitely request an atrium-view room). I saw some rooms in the St. Augustine-themed section, and they were more tastefully decorated. The colors were more subdued and made the atmosphere more luxurious as opposed to the loud colors in the Key West rooms. At any rate, the rooms were nice - of Hilton caliber - but not any better. Our bathroom had a door between the dressing area/sinks and the shower room. The bed was comfortable although the pillows were very flat. One nice feature was the computer with internet connection - free of charge courtesy of your $10 resort fee. Vending machines don't take cash, so be sure to bring your room key. As for facilities, this is a great place for a convention. The atrium is huge and has many restaurants and bars to spend time (and money) at. If you happen to be travelling for business, you'll enjoy the selection, and make sure to charge your dinner/beverages to your expense account! Anyone else on leisure travel, prepare to spend a pretty penny for pretty much anything. A slice of key lime pie came to $7, for example. If you happen to be visiting Orlando for the theme parks, do not stay here unless you have a car. Despite the shuttle service to the parks, the hotel is somewhat isolated, and nothing is within walking distance. Restaurants and stores are a 5-minute ride by car. Int'l Drive is fairly close and the parks are a few exits down I-4. In closing, I'd say that this hotel is large, impersonal, and pretentious, and does not entirely live up to its wow factor. The rooms are good, the service is good, but the price is high and they get you for loads of fees and add-on costs. Because of those drawbacks, I would not give it an excellent rating; however, I don't think many people would find fault with much else at the Gaylord Palms.

<Title>“Okay experience”
<Content>Booked this hotel for 4 nights on Priceline at a rate of $95 per night. Check in was lenghty due to people checking out and each person complaining about their bills, being next to noisy rooms, etc. It seemed nobody had anything nice to say, but being that I had reviews here I thought I would have a better experience. We were finally checked in and were given an option of upgrading to an atrium view room for $30 per night more. We declined to do this and were given a Florida view room in the St. Augustine section on the 5th floor. We go up to the room, open the door and are completely overwhelmed by the smell of smoke. I called down to the front desk and they sent someone up to the room with an ionizer which would require us to be out of the room for at least an hour and a half. So back down to the front desk we go to say that we would like to upgrade to an atrium view room. This apparently was a bother for them as 5 employees stood around discussing it for 15 minutes before we were assigned another room in the Key West section. Not sure what the fuss was about, we were paying for the upgrade, not getting it for free. We move all the luggage over to the new room which does not smell like smoke and has a balcony that looks out into the indoor atrium. The Key West section is loud because of the music they have at night, but that was nothing compared to the loud colors on the bedspreads. They were enough to give me a headache. These have to be the worst decorated hotel rooms I have ever seen. I've seen pictures of the other sections and those rooms seem to be much more subdued. Okay, enough complaining! I rated this hotel 3 stars so surely there must have been good things, right? Indeed there were. Valet parking was expensive but so worth it. They were prompt and friendly and remembered our names after the first night. One of the good things about Gaylord is the free in room computer. What a fabulous idea!! You can request your car from the valet right on the computer and tell them what time you would like it to be there. I can't tell you how much time that saved. The restaurant/bar in the Key West area was also very good. We ate there twice and enjoyed it. The hotel could definitely benefit from having a Starbucks there as good coffee is sorely missing. The indoor atrium is truly stunning and we thoroughly enjoyed walking around looking at everything. The novelty wore off after 4 days, but it's certainly worth seeing. We especially enjoyed the Everglades area. I thought the pools were nice, but being that there were only two for a resort this size was a bit odd. They should take a page out of the JW Marriott Grande Lakes and put in a more elaborate pool area. The hotel had some lovely shops that were actually quite impressive. One of the best hotel shopping experiences I have had. For you Vera Bradley lovers out there, they have an outstanding collection in two different stores. There are vending machines on each floor and the only form of payment they accept is room keys so make sure you bring your key if you are planning on getting any sodas. They do give you two waters each day in your hotel room fridge which is a nice touch. Overall, my stay had glimpses of excellence, but the check in experience along with the incredibly rude front desk staff left a bad impression that was hard to shake. I might stay there again if I was able to get a good rate. One last thing...if you are going to stay here, you need a car. No ifs,ands or buts about it. It is truly in the middle of nowhere and there is not enough to keep you entertained for more than a night or two.

<Title>“Great for a work convention, unique indoor atrium”
<Content>This hotel's (and that of the other Gaylord hotels) unique feature is its massive atrium. This one has a Florida theme with Everglades, Spanish fortress, Florida Keys, and alligator pit indoor areas. There are two outdoor pools, none indoor; one for kids, one for adults. The convention hall area is massive, and clean. The food was quite good, but it is expensive. One of the only places to get a cheap meal is at the poolside bar. We had a large room that had an indoor balcony with a view into the atrium. This place is great for business groups and adults, kids are not going to find as much to do as some of the other local resort hotels. Service was good. This hotel feels like a massive indoor city, kind of like it could be a casino, or a domed city on Mars or the Moon.

<Title>“Gaylord Palms - Quite Spectacular”
<Content>My husband and I recently took a vacation from our vacation while in the Clearwater area of Florida and decided to go to Disney for a few days. We got a great deal at the Gaylord Palms Resort. We were thrilled with our stay. Upon arrival, we were promptly greeted by the valet staff and bellhops. At check-in, we were given a free upgraded room with a balcony overlooking the gorgeous atrium. Our room was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful with all of our questions. There are quite a few restaurants in the resort, but we became regulars at the 24 hour café. We had great quiche and coffee there for breakfast, and had equally fabulous BLT Turkey Wraps and creamy tomato-basil soup one night at 11pm after being at the Magic Kingdom for 12 hours. Overall, we have no complaints about the Gaylord Palms and cannot wait to go back again soon.

<Title>“First class all the way!”
<Content>I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Gaylord Palms in Kissimmee during a national conference and I must say that it was one of the finest hotels I have ever visited. From the moment I arrived, it became clear that the staff are well trained, pleasant, efficient and accommodating and appreciate your business. My room was in the "Emerald" area and had a balcony overlooking the large atrium. The room, with two queen sized beds,was very clean and very plush. The only downside is the height of the sink and the height of the beds which were too high for someone of short stature like me (5'2"). The room has a computer with internet service and you can request anything via the computer--bellman, room service, etc. The hotel is huge and has multiple restaurants, bars and retail outlets and well as huge conference space and the Canyon Ranch Spa. I would definitely stay here again and again.

<Title>“Amazing place July 2007”
<Content>The Gaylord Palms Resort, I don't even know where to start, how about the moment we checked in. The staff were exceptional and this lasted the whole time we were here. We stayed 3 nights and 4 days. The hotel had so many things to do that the last day we just stayed in the hoel and had great family fun. The hotel is sorta an octagon shape and in the middle is a 4 acre atrium that is so big you could see something different everyday. Our family had a great vacation to end the summer off right. I believe the kids had the best time ever since we've been coming to Orllando for 6 years. Don't forget to check out the Canyon Ranch Spa either, great place to relax.

<Title>“Kids loved it!!”
<Content>We loved this hotel. It is very family friendly. We stayed at the hotel for our friends daughters sweet 16. The Key West area really caters to children. Among the teenagers we had with us , we also had pre-teens and toddlers. They all loved it. My husband and I also had a great time. This Resort has a lot more things to do and see than a average resort. We have stayed at many 5 star resorts and we would stay at this resort anythime. Very friendly staff and pretty good food. Close to Disney. If you are comparing to Dolphin or Swan, Gaylord Palms is Wayyyyy better.

<Title>“Gaylord Palms takes you away”
<Content>I just returned from 5 nights at the Gaylord Palms and can't understand the negative reviews. We were in the Key West area, which can be a a little noisy since the restaurant and bar are right below the balcony rooms. The entertainment ends at 10, though-so unless you are early to bed that is not an issue. The room was clean, when there was trouble with the internet it was dealt with promptly and all that was promised was delivered. Yes, the restaurants are pricey, but if you are there without a car-as we were there for a convention, the dollars you don't spend renting one or on a cab even things out. The atmosphere in the resort is calm and the plants are beautiful. The convenience to the convention area was great. If I was going to Disney I am not sure I would choose this hotel, but for a getaway or a convention stay it was abve average. Try to buy some snacks and a bottle of wine if you like it-the bar bill can add up and there is a fridge in the room.

<Title>“Worst hotel”
<Content>I stayed at this property for a convention. Mr Tom Brokaw was a key note speaker at the convention. I was not suprised when he opened his talk with how difficult it was to find parking, and how he just like I had to drive around the hotel to find right place to park. Following is my experieance at this hotel. I ordered room service which they gaurantee delivery in 30 mins or the food is complimentary. Each time I placed my order I was told it would take up to 90 min and the print ad could not be enforced because they are letting me know in advance. However each time the food was delivered cold and late based on the time promised for delivery almost 30 mins late each time. The food is terrible, you would find better breakfast with friendly service at McDonalds. The room was not cleaned properly each day of my stay they kept on throwing away bottled water and food which was placed in the fridge. However I found hot dogs in the room safe which was not cleaned from prior guests. I did not feel like using the safe and I ended up caring my computer for my entire stay. The pillow and the blanket had a smell of vomit which was not changed through out my stay upon several request. I wanted to move to another hotel close by but they would not refund my deposit of $200. The front desk told me I would be getting a king bed as promised when confirming the reservation, to my surprise I got double bed. Upon calling the desk to change the room I was told hotels is sold out and that all king beded rooms was occupied, however my co worker who came hours later was put into a king room. The staff was rude, I asked to speak to a General Manager several times during my stay, However he never returned my calls. The hotels looks great from the outside but beware of the people working inside....

<Title>“Decent Priceline Deal, Nice Hotel Experience”
<Content>I stayed at the Gaylord Palms for one night over Memorial Day weekend while on vacation. I bid $121 on priceline and I feel that I got a fair price. The room was very clean. The bathroom was a nice size and the beds were comfortable. The hotel staff we encountered was friendly and accommodating. Check-in was efficient and check-out was a breeze via the in-room computer. There is a resort fee, and it covers bottled water in the room (a plus to take to the pool), transportation to the theme parks, Internet service on the room computer, etc. Regarding the transportation to the parks: my friend and I were starting late afternoon and wanted a ride to the Magic Kingdom, literally a few miles down the road. We were told it would take over an hour to get there because the bus stops everywhere else first. We opted for other transportation! The hotel itself is fun to walk around; there are baby gators and beautiful plant life throughout. There is a useful 24 hour food shop for snacks and beverages and a dueling piano bar if you're looking for a place to unwind on the premises. We sat on the outside patio and relaxed / had a nice time. I thoroughly enjoyed the adult pool and the spa! I had a great aromatherapy facial and the spa facilities were excellent. Definitely a nice way to spend the day! I requested a room in the Everglades section so we wouldn't have to trek our stuff all over the large hotel (the Everglades section houses the adult pool and the spa, so our destinations were very close). I agree with other reviewers that they shouldn't charge $10 for parking when the lot is huge and they have so much property. The hotel was busy when we stayed, so we had to self-park clear across the universe, which can be annoying with all your luggage. Once you're on site, you need to drive if you want food or anything else outside the facility... All in all, it was a nice experience and I would stay there again.

<Title>“Very Nice Stay!”
<Content>I stayed here because of a convention, but since I was here for a week, I was able to take it all in. Check in was fine and pain free. Staff outside greeted you warmly and the front desk gave you a map so you could get to your room. Room was was clean and smelled fresh. I was able to get an extra large room with 2 beds since they didn't have any more king beds, and it had tons of space. Closet space and drawer space was perfect. The bathroom is seperate from the double sink area, very nice for getting ready in the morning. One of the best parts was the housekeeping. There's a little button next do your door on the wall, and you can press it to have your room cleaned or do not disturb. Better and classier then hanging the door knob signs. Anyway, if you press the clean room button and leave, they clean it in a half hour. I thought that was great, since I had to go back and forth from the convention. Were the rooms anything special (besides a few nice perks)? No, but it was clean, and warm. ALL the restaurants were very good. All had a nice unique atmosphere depending on the location inside this place (Key West, Everglades, St. Augustine). Was the food a little over priced? Yes...They are all expensive, but for the most part worth it. Sunset Sam's in the Key West area was the best in my opinion. Great fun with all the side shows, and REALLY great fish. Crab Cakes and Lobster were superb. Pools were booth nice. One for the kids the other for adults. Convention space is huge and easy to get back and forth to and from your room. Shops were very nice and you can get Diseny tickets at the Diseny Store. The PGA Store has great prices on clothing. 24 hour market place to get food late, and GREAT Cuban sandwitches. Also in the room was a safe and a fridge with free bottled water. Oh, and the best part of the room was the free internet access. Computer with a flat screen monitor was a nice and helpful touch. Great place!

<Title>“Luxury on a Budget”
<Content>Room Price: We booked about three weeks prior to our arrival over the Memorial Day weekend. The price we got was $189/night. I checked on-line with the hotel website, priceline and expedia the day before we left and it was the exact same price. Getting there: Since we live several states away, my husband and children and I flew to Orlando and took a car service (Happy Limo) which is only slightly higher than a cab and yet so much more luxurious. It takes away the stress of navigating and they throw in this bonus: a free 15-minute stop at a grocery store. They will even tell you which one is most convenient so that you can fax an order the day before you leave, then on your way to the hotel just pick it up! Why not take advantage of the free fridge the hotel gives you? So, we picked up some bottled water and snacks, what a savings when you compare what those same items cost at theme parks/hotel! (Note: MCO Orlando's main airport is only about 20 minutes from the hotel. Sanford is about an hour away.) Check in: Went smoothly. They honored every request. My husband does not like bright yellow or pink, it is hard for him to relax with loud colors so we avoided the Key West hotel rooms and were assigned to the Everglades section of the hotel where the decor was more subtle and restful. This hotel is quite large but directions were clear and everything well-marked. The room: It was clean and smelled fresh. It was perfect for the four of us. We requested a Florida view so that we could see the fireworks from Epcot at night. Right below the view was of the parking lot, but we were on the fifth floor so mostly our view was of Epcot from afar. Closet space and drawer space was plentiful for the four of us. The bathroom is seperate from the double sink area, very nice for getting ready in the morning. The room was a good size, no complaints! We were traveling to relax and found plenty to do over the long weekend at the hotel. There are two pools, one that is adults-only and the other, busier pool for families. The pool has an octupus-slide that was a lot of fun! It also has zero-entry and the little kids and their parents liked that! I will advise you parents to bring your own pool toys since they charge for theirs at the pool. I just brought a blow-up beach ball and inner tube and the kids had a blast playing with them! I will also warn that in the summer the area has "lovebugs" . That is what they are called. They don't bite and they didn't come near the water, but if you sat on the chairs by the pool you would notice them. Also, the hotel has a spa, an arcade (our children loved playing air hockey) and there are lots of scenic areas to the hotel. We had an employee take our picture as a family and are glad we did. This is a great incentive for weddings to book here. There is a wedding pavillion over the "fountain of youth", waterfalls, koi fish, lush foliage, bridges...all well-maintained and little benches tucked into the nooks to read or just sit and admire the beauty. The longer you look, the more you will notice. We began to notice a real banana tree and flowers that were shaped into the form of a bird. Our children also liked exploring the fort and a small area of the Everglades with turtles, snakes and an alligater! The alligaters in the main part of the atrium are fed nightly at 6:30. Theme parks: Gaylord Palms will shuttle you for free to Disney. Their buses are well-marked, air-conditioned, comfortable, clean and the driver was funny and knowledgable. (When you factor in the shuttles and in-hotel entertainment options, it doesn't seem as expensive!) The schedule is printed out for your convenience near the concierge. The shuttle leaves about every hour and a half. While I think that is pretty good for a non-Disney hotel, if you have come to the Gaylord Palms to go to the theme parks every day, I think you are in the wrong place. Disney hotels are comparable in price and their shuttles leave every 15 minutes and are much, much closer to the gate. (That may sound lazy, but after walking ALL DAY with your kids, it is a big deal.) If you want to visit Disney only one day then you could just peek at the schedule and plan around it. Serious fans of the Mouse will be annoyed at how long it takes to get to the parks (Magic Kingdom is furthest and you would want to be there early since the park is opened in a special way. Also, crowds are lowest the first hour the park is open.) So, consider transportation but remember that at the end of your Disney day if you don't want to waste your precious vacation time waiting for the shuttle you can do what we did and just take a cab back to the hotel for $20! Dining Options: You probably have heard about the $8 hot dogs at the pool, or the $28/ person buffet. We ate them and the food was fresh and tasted good. We especially enjoyed the Italian buffet because it was fresh, plenty of options- a bar for salads, a bar of appetizers, a bar for freshly carved meat, pasta made-to-order and a dessert bar. The atmosphere was classy with candles and low lights. Adding to the romantic atmosphere is a roving musician that serenades the guests. My husband and I loved this darling man playing his guitar and singing us a love song. Then my husband tipped him to come back and sing another one. Wonderful experience! We also ordered pizza one night to help our budget. For those on a tight budget, while you are putting in your order at the grocery store, just add on peanut butter and jelly, bread, paper plates and milk and that will help a lot! For lunch one day we took the hotel shuttle to the entrance of the Magic Kingdom. At this entrance there is also an entrance to Disney's Monorail. (Make sure you don't go into the theme park, you want to go to the Monorail!) The Monorail is free to everyone and it stops at Disney's Grand Floridian (they have many dining options including an afternoon tea. This hotel is Victorian and beautiful!! Outside just walk around the pools, stop and get a drink near the pool then walk around their white sand beaches and enjoy the view! They are plenty of beautiful spots to sit down and relax.) , Disney's Contemporary Resort, and Disney's Polynesian Resort. We ate lunch at the Polynesian's Kona Cafe, they have a chocolate torte for dessert that is sooo yummy! Sure, it isn't much cheaper at Disney than at the Gaylord Palms, but it is a change of scenery and opens up your options. We think it is neat to see what these hotels offer and their theming is pretty neat, too! Overall, we had a great time. The hotel was beautiful. There was plenty to do over a long weekend. Bring your camera. I would recommend this hotel for families that want a quiet weekend to swim and unwind, honeymooners, seniors. I would not recommend it for serious Disney fans because they would find the location and waiting time inconvenient.

<Title>“Lovely resort-Bad Pillows!!”
<Content>Stayed May 20 for 4 nights. Came for convention-would not choose it as a destination using my own funds. Location is good for Disney travelers IF you have a rental car and can leave the premises. The hotel does run a shuttle schedule to Disney parks everyday. Good grocery store (Publix) & Walgreens down the road and other less expensive restaurant choices (excellent Olive Garden). Not within walking distance. Convention facilities were excellent. Spa facilities were adequate (nothing like Vegas spas :( Prices were comparable however. Front desk staff friendly and helpful. No problem with early check-in and special requests. Had an atrium facing room on the 8th fl which was reasonably quiet. Room equipped with small refrigerator which we stocked from the nearby Publix. Room size was good-pillows were awful! The pin feathers were sticking thru the cases. Requested others and the ones they brought up were equally bad. Attempted to eat at the Old Hickory and was disappointed-steak was dry, overcooked-seating was uncomfortable-disappointing wine list. Best food and service was at Sunset Sams. Nice ambiance - evening entertainment. The coffee/sandwich shop had delicious sandwiches, soup and great coffee. Reasonably priced. It could be a good deal if you get a lower price on Hotwire or Priceline. It is a lovely, oversized resort/convention facility.

<Content>Room was nicely appointed. Pool, grounds, and atrium were nicely maintained. Meals were very expensive for a family of four. We tried to economize by purchasing cereal and milk at the hotel's small store. A pint of milk was $2.00!!

<Title>“A World Class Resort...”
<Content>My husband and I just returned from a three night stay at the Gaylord Palms in Orlando. What a top notch establishment...the attention to detail is extraordinary. From pulling up at valet parking, through the check in process, to the room and the surroundings it simply cannot be beat. At check-in we received a complimentary upgrade to an atrium room with a limited, but still great view of the area. Jenna, our guest service representative was so friendly and attentative. The room was absolutely stunning with granite dual sinks, a marbled tile shower and beautiful wood decor with a ceiling fan. All of the valet attendants were courteous and service was prompt. The amenities in the room were top notch. We used the in-room safe and they even have a computer in every room so we had access to the internet our entire stay. We utilized the South Beach pool which was for adults only it was so relaxing not to have to listen to kids screaming. We ate lunch one day onsite at one of the small cafes and it was very good as well. This place is worth the money. We have stayed at other four and five star resorts at Disney, but Gaylord Palms is by far the best. We thought at first it was going to be far away from everything, but it is very close to International drive and to Downtown Disney. We would definitely recommend this hotel and we would definitely stay there again. Kudos to Gaylord! : )

<Title>“Beautiful Property”
<Content>I stayed at the Gaylord Palms for a convention. The property was beautiful and well maintained. My room overlooked the courtyard. It was nice to be able to hear the water features in the hotel. My room was nice. The room itself was clean, however my bedspread and my bottom sheet were stained...I chose the other bed to sleep in. The staffed was very friendly and helpful. I purchased a shirt while there and the clerk at the shop offered to have to pressed (steamed) so I could wear it the next day. I thought that was great. The pools were great. Nice and large. The fitness center was wonderful. Lots of equipment. Since I did not have a car I was forced to eat on sight...two words...VERY EXPENSIVE! I ate at the Steak House the first night and was shocked by the prices...OUCH! Thank goodness the conference that I was attending provided most of the meals for us. Overall, I would definately go back...but next time I would rent a car so I would not stranded there.

<Title>“Great Hotel - Expensive Food”
<Content>We loved the hotel and the grounds. We got an incredible deal on hotwire, so we couldn't beat the value. The service was excellent. We were traveling with two small children and they were very accomodating. The only complaint was that the food was very expensive. We were not traveling on an expense account and we had failed to rent a car, so our dining options were limited to the Resort. A simple continental breakfast cost us over $8--too much to spend on a bowl of cereal and a banana for a two year old. The restaurants were very expensive and we wound up ordering in pizza one night. But if you're on an expense account or have a car to get to the store (each room has a refrigerator) or to other dining options, this is a fantastic place to stay.

<Title>“liked it a lot!”
<Content>We surprisingly enjoyed our one night stay at the Gaylord Palms. We accompanied my husband there while he had a conference, then headed to Miami to see family. It is a huge hotel. The kids loved the alligator viewing. The pool was great, although my one complaint is that they could use a life-guard. There were some older boys cutting up on the water slide, and it's hard to explain to a 5 year old and 7 year old why they can't do what the big boys are doing. The food was great, with a lot of restaurant choices. It was especially nice having the computers in the room with free internet. I would definitley recommend this hotel to others. It is very close to Disney!

<Title>“Totally mixed!”
<Content>My entire experience was tainted by the fact that I landed there in the middle of a National Cheerleading Convention. There were literally thousands of young and teenage girls, complete with unbearably loud techno music coursing through the beautiful atrium throughout the hotel. My entire hallway was filled with doors decorated with pom poms and megaphones. I endured doors slamming every few seconds day and night, girls runnning and screaming through the halls nonstop, groups congregating outside my door tossing a ball against my door and cheering. At first security did basically nothing and said "oh well, the cheerleaders are here". After two nights I was ready to abort my vacation (this hotel was prepaid for me so I was stuck) and go home. I went to the desk and initially the staff gave me the party line "we can't move you, there aren't any rooms where the kids aren't" but then took pity on me and moved me to a suite in the area of the hotel where the "staff" for the convention stayed. Why they didn't automatically put people uninvolved in the convention there in the first place is beyond me. It was like trying to relax in the middle of a loud sporting event day and night. It was hard to enjoy ANY of the amenities of the hotel. Once I moved and once the cheerleaders left, I was able to finally relax, enjoy the pool (they returned the adults only pool to adults only half way through my stay) and jacuzzi. But my vacation was half way through. The hotel in my opinion needs to either make it unavailable to other travelers during those 4 days of that convention or reserve a special section just for people uninvolved in it. Other than that, the hotel is beautiful, food was good but pricey and I also enjoyed the spa one day.

<Title>“Very Nice, but Expensive”
<Content>Stayed at the Gaylord for four days in March for a conference, and brought family along to "do Orlando". Room was clean and comfy - two queen beds with a good deal of space to get around the room. Bathroom well light and clean. A bit of a walk from reception to the room, but not awful. Prices for food a bit expensive, but not out of line for the type of hotel. Pools were cold (not heated) but hot tub good and hot. Staff very friendly and helpful - from arrival with car to front desk and concierge to restaurant staff and business center. Spa services (Canyon Ranch) excellent - 90% of their business is from conventions at the hotel so they are good about getting you in and out fast between events. Shuttle service to local parks convenient, but could run later in night. Valet parking expensive, but probably not over what most "high end" hotels charge. Overall, I family and I were comfy and happy - no problems, just minor annoyances.

<Title>“Great service but crowded”
<Content>We stayed here 4 nights for a conference that my husband had. You are captive here as there is little within walking distance - there is a Walgreens about 1 mile away if you need "stuff. " The few restaurants were very expensive. We ate one night at the Old Hickory which I guess was good for most of our party. I am a vegetarian and got a mediocre ravioli, but it is a steakhouse. However, for the price they could have done better for me. The Villa Flora is quite pricey unless you are a big eater. The Java (Something) was fine until the 7,000 people descended on Saturday - 50 people in line, and this is this is the only place to get a cup of coffee, fruit, sandwich (pre-made) etc. We left on Sunday, but were told by others in our group who left later that both pools were closed most of the day for private parties...so watch out if you're planning a "pool day" The Canyon Ranch Spa Club is wonderful, great treatments, excellent and talented staff. Other staff members were responsive, polite and thorough, and room service for the most part happened within their self-imposed 30-minute window. Front desk staff and concierige were also excellent. Note, however, that when we checked in we were promised a bottle of champagne, which took almost 3 hours (and two phone calls from us) to arrive, and another evening we received the wrong wine. Both through room service - wondering if there's a problem with the alcohol part of room service... Other have mentioned a noise problem with atrium-facing rooms - we were on the 9th floor and the only noise we heard was from the many waterfalls in the atrium. The entire place was beautifully maintained, especially the atrium with neat water features with alligators and fish, and beautiful flowers and plants. Rooms, guest and meeting, were clean. My biggest complaint is that with all the property this huge complex takes up, there are no walking or hiking trails - I hoofed it around the outside of the complex - mostly blacktop, but do stop and say "hi" to the cattle grazing next door. And, even with a car, driving in Orlando is awful. Terrible traffic, I turned around after trying to make it to the Millenia Mall after seeing bumper-to-bumper traffic going 30 mph on a main expressway.

<Title>“Just Okay...”
<Content>I just returned from the Gaylord Palms a few days ago with my family. First I have to say that I stayed in the Gaylord in Nashville. The Palms is a little smaller I think and we were a little disappointed overall with food, the stores, and the pricing of them all. Being able to compare the two hotels and others like it is what leads me to my title, “Just Okay”. The rooms are very nice, housekeeping was very good and timely, and everything is kept clean, just like Nashville. I’m an early riser and if you have a balcony room you get to see the cleaning that goes on while everyone is sleeping. One thing I love is that they wipe down every handrail in the place on a daily basis. The food here was quite expensive and I was fortunate to have driven here. I had a real bad fish sandwich by the pool the wife and kids had nachos and cheese sticks, a few beers and a couple of Cokes. $76! I swear the fish I had was a frozen Gordon’s breaded fish filet on a bun. Not having ate in the other restraints in this hotel I can’t tell you if the prices are worth it or not but you can get a great dinner anywhere for $25 a plate. This place does not have any businesses in walking distant so your pretty much trapped here and forced to eat their high priced meals. Unless you drove or have a rental car, but I’m sure most are there for a conference (Like we were) and it’s going on the company’s tab. I couldn’t even justify someone else paying for it and we always went out. Nashville was a little better in the food department. That was a couple of years ago though and it could have changed. Like others said, the stores were nice to look at but to pricey. Others complained about the noise but we never had a problem. We slept with the doors open every night we were there (Wednesday through Saturday and left Sunday). No parties no band, just the soothing sounds of waterfalls. The bed were better than average, but I’ve had better. The bath area was big with double sinks ceramic tile floors. There was plenty of coffee, hair dryer, ironing board and iron, refrigerator but no microwave. No way to heat up your leftovers, so you have to go buy more food, no doggy bags. There were also plenty of wooden hangers a safe for valuables and internet access. You have a password protected computer in your room that only you can access. There are personal greetings from the hotel as well as the conferences you’re attending. All of your meetings are easily accessible and each meeting you click on brings up a map from your room to the room the meeting will be in. This was a real neat fetcher and very convenient. One thing that was a little concerning was all of the solicitations we received at our room. Walking down the hall you could see that these were conference related solicitations and only targeted to people attending the conference. These were not place on ever door but it made me wonder who was doing this and how much information did they have about who was in the room. I forgot to ask about this before I left at 5:00AM. To busy loading up the car. To sum it all up, this hotel was pricey, but clean. If you’ve never seen one of these huge floral, jungles inside a huge atrium I’m sure you’ll be impressed. If you are in the area take a look inside (pay parking) you may be sold just looking at it. AN

<Title>“Very nice but overpriced”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the Gaylord Palms as part of our anniversary trip to Orlando. We booked the room on a "name your own price" website and were able to secure a room with a king size bed for Friday-Sunday for less than $100 a night. I would suggest following this avenue for anybody interested in staying at this property. The price I paid is about 1/3 of what the room would have normally cost. The check-in process was very easy. The gentleman at the desk was very cordial and extremely willing to help. This is, however, where I ran into the largest problem. The gentleman asked if I was parking with the valet or if I was self parking. I have no problem with parking myself, so I chose that option. You can park in a gated lot that requires a room key to access after hours. To my surprise, upon check-out I was charged $10 a day for self parking. I have paid for parking at a hotel before. But generally that would occur in a more urban setting. And was always notified ahead of time. The Gaylord Palms is off the highway surrounded by cow pastures. Literally! Charging hotel guests to park is beyond ridiculous. Because this occured upon check-out , it did not affect the actual trip. The room itself was very nice. Aside from the king size bed, the room featured a desk with an actual desktop computer for internet access. The bathroom was large and well thought out. My only complaint would be there is no fan in the bathroom. The amenities of the hotel are top notch. There are two outdoor pools; one for adults and one for children. Both are well maintained. The children's pool features a water slide and water cannons. The hot tub is also well maintained. Also the inside of the hotel is designed to feel like three different areas of Florida; St. Augustine, Key West and the Everglades. All of are very pleasing and feature live animals. There are multiple restaurants, shops and bars on the property. All of the restaurants are high priced, same with the bars. If you are staying on the property it is a good amenity to have. However, because of the location you are within driving distance of many, many restaurants and bars. My overall experience was great. The hotel has spent alot of money making it a top hotel in Orlando. You will pay for the niceness of the hotel, including having to pay for parking.

<Title>“Excellent conference facility”
<Content>I stayed here for three nights in March for a conference that was taking place at the adjacent conference center. I really have no complaints about this hotel except that I was unfortunate enough to get a view of the parking lot from my room. But the room was great, ample size, comfortable beds, large bathroom, and large working area. The in-room computer system was useful to pull up maps and meeting notes. The restaurants were very good (we ate at key west, and the buffet for lunch and breakfast). The key west bar area was a blast at night, with live music and other entertainment. The facility as a whole is extremely impressive and is designed to cater to the business traveler. Service was outstanding and friendly. But, the prices are steep - $10 for a sandwich at the deli/coffee shop, plus $10 a day resort fee added to all bills, and $20 for the breakfast buffet. I poked around the hotel's pools and they looked like fun, but there aren't many kids here. It's a fine place to bring the family while you attend a meeting, but I wouldn't pick this as my first choice or even my top five if I were coming to Orlando only for vacation. But as a business/conference hotel, this is an elite establishment.

<Title>“OK if You Like Living in the Rainforest Cafe 24/7”
<Content>I have stayed at the Gaylord Palms 3 times for conferences. It is a fine conference hotel but I wouldn't elect to stay here for leisure travel. It is an impressive-appearing place inside and out; however the novelty of living inside a glass atrium bubble wears thin after a couple of days and you are captive without a car. There is much to see under the bubble for first-time visitors and I definitely recommend strolling each path through the themed areas of Key West, St. Augustine and the Everglades replete with lush area-appropriate foliage, fog machines, koi ponds, tropical fishponds, the castle, Sam's sailboat etc. It would be a terrific place for kids on a rainy day. Conference food was excellent -- it is hard to feed 1,000 people simultaneously and they do an outstanding job. The few times I purchased food or beverages I felt they were of excellent quality but pricey, e.g., $13 hamburger. I loved having internet access from my room and that was a huge plus. What I disliked about this hotel experience is the construction: flimsy walls between rooms so you hear your neighbors; economy-minded HVAC systems that turn off the air circulation fan; noise that carries from the atrium bubble and hallways into the guestrooms. If only they'd paid as much attention to construction as they did to landscaping; I guess this demonstrates why this hotel is run by Gaylord Entertainment Company and not the Gaylord Hotel Company. "Florida View" rooms are quieter but have no balconies and overlook expansive parking lots and highway. Staff are generally very accomodating. The Canyon Ranch Spa is a wonderful amenity. Onsite shops are average and carry souvenir and personal care basics. It was too cold to use the pool and jacuzzis during my recent stay but the facilities are lovely and add to the "resort" feel. Despite the terrific amenities and public areas I can only give the place 3 stars because of the noisy guestrooms.

<Title>“Love this hotel”
<Content>This is absolutely the most amazing hotel we have ever stayed at. In fact, we like it even better than staying inside Disney. It is stunning with guest rooms which look out into an atrium with palm trees and banana trees and exotic flowers. It has restaurants and shops - all inside the atrium. It has waterfalls and alligators and turtles and pathways that lead to different themed sections of the atrium. It gives you the feel of being outside, but it's all inside. Everything is immaculate and the rooms are good size. There are 2 pools, one for adults and one for families. Everything about this hotel is great. It is less than 5 minutes from the Disney parks and has Disney transportation. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Title>“Good, not terrific”
<Content>Thank God for Priceline (at $95 + taxes) per night. This is a great option for Priceline in the Walt Disney World Resort area (in resort category at Priceline). This hotel was decent but nothing out of this world. It is dead at night and the hotel is mediocre at best! It is a lovely and new lace (5 years old) and the staff is very courteous since they were actually nice to us even though we booked on Priceline. The rooms are very cool and the resort taxes 9$10/day) included high speed internet (using THEIR own in-room computer), 2 bottles of Dasanti per day, among a few other things. One piece of advice: Ask for a corner "oersized room" as they are in all categories of roomtypes (from standard to atrium) and are about 50% larger. The other rooms appear small. Good luck, and really it is a lovely place that will not kill you if you get it on Priceline (and this was the lowest category of the walt disney resort categories you can get!

<Title>“Upscale conference hotel”
<Content>I stayed at the Gaylord Palms Feb. 10 - 14th for a business conference. Getting to the hotel - The Gaylord is about 25 minutes from the Orlando airport when traffic is not too heavy. Do you need a car? The Gaylord has complimentary shuttle service to the Disney parks and to Falcon's Fire golf course. The golf course "shuttle" is actually via a town car. If you are going to be at the hotel or just going back and forth to the theme parks then I would recommend that you hire a towncar to take you to and from the airport as it actually will end up being cheaper than renting a car and paying the Gaylord daily parking fee. Your driver will meet you at baggage claim and by the hotel when you leave and let him deal with traffic, tolls, and directions.The way to go. I arrived at 10:00 am on a Saturday, had to wait about three minutes in line before the courteous agent was able to check me in early to a requested room with an atrium view. I stayed in the St. Augustine section and it was a bit of a trek hauling my luggage to the room. The room itself was very nice with an upscale feel to it. As mentioned I had an atrium facing room with doors that opened onto an indoor balcony with two chairs. Yes, if you are a light sleeper an Atrium facing room may be too noisy otherwise you may notice some noise but it never was a bother. Room had a ceiling fan as well which I used and enjoyed. King sized bed, chair, desk and work chair, good sized tv, and a computer with hotel info and internet access comprised the room. A refigerator was underneath the TV and had rom to store some drinks, snacks, leftovers, etc. The bathroom had a double sink vanity with enough room, hairdryer, coffee maker, and a variety of toiletries. No bath but rather a very nice tiled shower, actually one of the nicest hotel showers I have ever experienced. Large towels were very nice. The $10 dollar resort fee gets you 2 bottles of water replenished daily in your fridge and a daily paper as well as access to the gym. The gym was a decent size with about 7 treadmills, 3 or 4 bikes and 3 or 4 ellipticals along with a variety of weight machines and free weights. There also is a small area for classes but I think there is a separate fee for those. Two large pools, sand volleyball, a fancy putt-putt (extra fee), rounded out the recreation options. Other than conference food, which was the best conference food I have had, I ate at two of the restaurants. Sunset Sam's is a seafood themed restaurant which I enjoyed. $45 for two drinks and my entree, and tip. I also ate in the bar at the Old Hickory steakhouse. $35 for a drink and two appetizers. Food was very good at both. Overall an enjoyable stay. The only question you have to decide for yourself is one of value. Are you willing to pay $200 - $250 for an upscale hotel experience?

<Title>“All I can say is WOW!”
<Content>What a great experience! My husband, five year old son and myself stayed at the Gaylord Palms February 7-9th. We had a great time, and there was tons to do. I have nothing negative to say at all about the hotel. Check in was a breeze and then we drove to the Key West parking to leave our car ($10+tax a day fee.) We got a little lost on our way to the room- the hotel is that big, they even give you a map when you check in. Our room was in the St. Augustine section, a suite on the 7th floor. What can I say- it was gorgeous. The suite was immaculate and very tastfully decorated. We had a livingroom/sitting area, dining table with seats for 8, computer station, wet bar with fridge, 2 balconies, bedroom, and bathroom with separate toliet/shower area. The room was VERY comfortable and we could really spread out. The couch pulled out so my son could sleep there and my husband and I had some privacy with our own bedroom. There was a tv in the bedroom and living room, DVD player too. At the hotel there is a daily resort fee of $10+tax. This included internet, 2 bottles of Dasani water, paper delivery, and use of the fitness club, etc... The bed was very, very comfortable and clean. I am a germaphobe and I felt right at home. In the bathroom they give you nice toiletries: soaps, body lotion, shampoo & conditioner, and an amenity kit. They are replenished daily. There was no tub, but the shower was roomy with a built in bench which was nice. Some people have complained about noise but I honestly have no idea what they are talking about. It was very quiet in the room. The hotel itself has so much to see. My son and I would take a walk around in the afternoon while my husband napped. While we were there they we doing work to the family pool so it was closed. It looked great though, it has some sort of octopus slide and a sand play area. This is also where the kids club is. There is another pool, the south beach pool, which is normally for adults but since the other pool was closed everyone could go there. It was very nice, reminicent of the pools at the Delano or the National hotel in South Beach. It was heated just enough so we were able to go in, there are also 2 hot tubs. I didn't use the spa or fitness club so I can't comment but they looked very nice and I noticed the fitness club offered classes like yoga and pilates at certain times. The hotel is designed into different areas that you walk through on your way around the hotel. Each area has it's own theme and restaurants. The Key West area is very colourful with wooden decks and beautiful sand scupltures around a big water area that even had a very large boat in it (it's a bar) every evening they have performers around just like at Mallory square, a few times a week in the afternoon they feed the fish. The Everglades area is something to see. There are little streams and flora and fauna everywhere, it's even a little foggy. In the evening little lights come on that look like fireflies. There is also a little shack ( make sure you go inside) that has tanks with snakes, turtles, baby gators and I think frogs. It's great for kids, don't miss it. Twice or three times a week (in gator springs) thay have gator feedings which is also fun for the kids to watch. My son loved it. The St. Augustine area has a scaled down replica of Castillo de Morro. It's fun to walk around in there, there are little ponds all around with Koi. In the Emerald area there are shops and it leads to the convention center. It's a beautiful hotel to walk around and there are plenty of places to sit. It's very close to Disney (I think they have a shuttle) and just a short drive to Universal or I-drive.

<Title>“great hotel”
<Content>We just returned from a 4 night stay at the Gaylord Palms Resort and enjoyed it greatly. Food, service, accommodations were first rate, and the hotel is huge so be prepared to walk a lot to reach everything the hotel has to offer, which is a lot!!!

<Title>“Better than it sounds!”
<Content>Stayed 12/30 - Jan 2. Booking at the last minute for a trip to Orlando at one of the busiest times of year, a lot of hotels were already booked up. Found a room at the Gaylord, and wondered what on earth was wrong with it! Was quite wary given that a gaylord around these parts is a large cardboard box! Turned out to be not so bad at all. I found this hotel very reasonably priced for a decent resort – averaging $249 USD a night for our atrium view room in the Saint Augustine section. The service at the hotel was very good. We called from the airport at 7.30 AM to see if we could get a super-early check in after our redeye from the West Coast and they went out of their way to have a room ready for our arrival an hour later. Check in itself was extremely expeditious. During our stay we had a problem with housekeeping, but as soon as we complained, management dealt it with very quickly and courteously. It seemed as though all of the staff members was very committed to high service standards. The atrium was beautiful, and I enjoyed walking around the pathways, checking out the baby alligators etc. We didn’t try any of the restaurants in the hotel as the only one that looked appealing to us (the Old Hickory Steakhouse) was booked up during our stay. The main casual restaurant was buffet only, and we’re not really buffet people. There was also a casual café, but all of their food was made elsewhere and sold as packaged sandwiches etc., and that is not really our thing either. An informal family style restaurant where you could get a quick sandwich or salad would have been appreciated. For a hotel as large as the Palms is, I’m surprised they didn’t have one. The only really tempting option was the Ben & Jerry’s sundae shop, and we managed to resist. But only barely. Overall, we appreciated the good service and the somewhat more adult-oriented ambiance of this hotel. Kids would enjoy staying here too, I'm sure, but it did not feel like a kiddie land.

<Title>“Very Nice”
<Content>Very nice hotel. The atrium area is beautiful. Only stayed one night but the bed was comfortable and the room clean and nicely appointed. Upon arrival we were upgraded to an atrium view even though we booked on hotwire. Each room also has a computer with internet access (free) which is great for restaurant research. Can't speak of dining or spa services since we didn't use them, however the on site bar was nice with decent entertainment. Stayed at the Gaylord for one nite because our on site Disney hotel did not have a room - Should have saved my money and stayed at the Gaylord the entire trip- It was much, much nicer than the "four" star Swan/Dolphin which is basically a really big Howard Johnson's!

<Title>“Bring Earplugs!”
<Content>My wife and I booked a 5 night stay at the Gaylord Palms directly with the hotel over 3 weeks prior to arrival. We requested and were confirmed a KING room - Florida (parking lot / hwy) View. Upon arrival at 4:00 pm, we were told there were no King size rooms left in the hotel! We were "upgraded" to a Double room - Atrium View. We stayed in the St Augustine wing - Room 6119. This is, without a doubt, the NOISIEST hotel I have ever stayed at! We had to sleep in earplugs due to the blaring music and bass coming from the Christmas shows and other random noise in the atrium. It actually vibrated the french doors that led out onto the balcony overlooking the atrium! We had flown all day, and were very tired. Plus, my wife is pregnant. My wife called to complain, and the person who answered the phone was very short. He said, "Well, the shows will be over by 10:00 pm." Not much solace to someone who wants to take a nap or is worn out from traveling or spending all day at the theme parks! There are NO rubber gaskets around the door frames that lead out onto the balcony overlooking the atrium. In fact, we could see about 1inch of daylight under the doors! The glass in the french doors themselves is just single pane - not double pane. While I will say that we both loved the Christmas decorations throughout the atrium, if we hear one more rendition of "The Little Drummer Boy" I think we will pull our hair out! The property needs to invest some capital in soundproofing the Atrium view rooms. We visited some friends who were staying in rooms NOT facing the atrium (Florida View). Those rooms had no outside noise problem. The last night, after spending 13 hours at Epcot, we arrived back to the hotel at 10:00 pm - dreading our flight the next morning. Before we even approached the door to our room, we could hear yelling sounds coming down the hallway. It was the sound of about 4 guys yelling at a football game on the TV in the room adjoining ours! Once in our room, we could hear every word they said. Again, we were worn out and just wanted to get some rest We called the front desk, and were told security would be up to talk to them. Again, there was no sound proofing around the door between our two rooms. We could actually see their lights on coming from underneath the connecting doors! At 2:00 am, they finally turned out the lights and went to sleep. Finally, the towels were less than luxurious for a supposed 4 star hotel. We were actually left a towel that had a hole in it the size of a grapefruit and was frayed around the edges! At checkout, I asked to speak to the manager on duty. She was very nice, apologetic and embarrassed. She credited us 1 night off our bill. Also, the hotel is very isolated from restaurants and other activities. So, you really need to have a rental car if you do not want to be trapped.

<Title>“Take "just a few minutes" & ice this one off your list”
<Content>After three previous positive experiences at the Gaylord Palms our recent stay from December 30, 2006 until January 3, 2007 was, in a word, terrible. Our check in was anytime after 3:00 p.m. so we arrived at 6:00 p.m. to start our four day New Year's vacation. Within "just a few minutes" our car was unpacked and taken off to the valet parking lot (at a rate of $17.00 per day). After "just a few minutes" of waiting in a terribly long line at the check in counter, due to a terribly understaffed reception desk, we were assured that our room would be ready in "just a few minutes" and we would be called on our cellphone. After wandering around the hotel atrium (which after 4 visits is not as terribly impressive as the first time you see it) for over an hour with no call, we returned to the front desk to see what was taking so terribly long. There, after waiting "just a few more minutes" for a second time in a similarly terribly long line, the terribly exasperated young man at the reception desk assured us that it would "just be a few minutes" more and we would be finally called. After "just a few more minutes" than that, we finally got our room. When I informed the young man that we had checked in our luggage at the bellmen's station ($10.00 tip) "just a few minutes" after our arrival, but well over an hour earlier, he assured us that a bellmen would bring our bags up to our room in "just a few minutes". Within "just a few minutes" walk across the lovely atrium gardens, we finally arrived at our 7th floor suite (7331) in the Emerald Bay section (at a cost with tax of over $300.00 per day). Every call to the bellmen's desk was answered with the response "your luggage will be there in 'just a few minutes' ". We patiently waited for 45 minutes and then left wearing our same travel clothes, since our luggage had yet to arrive in our room as promised, and we had dinner reservations in the hotel restaurant in "just a few minutes" at 8:00 p.m. We arrived after "just a few minutes" stroll across the replica of the "Castillo de San Marco" at the picturesque mock sailboat floating Sunset Sam's Restaurantat promptly at 8:00 p.m., only to be told that our reserved table was not available, but if we would go wait in their bar section it should be available in "just a few minutes", and our beeper would vibrate and flash. The four of us proceeded to the neat looking bar where we each ordered a drink. Since I was terribly disappointed at having to wait for a reserved table I had two single malt scotches. Within "just a few minutes" we had spent $80.00 for two rounds each but since we had neither felt any vibrations nor seen any flashes, we proceeded to order appetizers at the bar. Even though we were assured by the nice bartender that it would only "take a few minutes" to get our three plate tower of cold seafood (at a cost of $40.00) the order didn't arrive until we were taken to our table over one hour after our reservation time and "just a few minutes" before our entrees arrived at the table. When we saw bread on all of the nearby tables other than our own, we inquired of our waitress if we could get some for ourselves. She returned to our table after "just a few minutes" only to tell us that they had run out of bread "just a few minutes" earlier. We finished our meal and paid the terribly over-priced bill ($178.00) for the terrible service and returned to our room hoping for a better tomorrow. Unfortunately, to our terrible surprise instead of a restfull slumber, we were suddenly awakened "just a few minutes" after 8:00 a.m. to Christmas music blaring from loudspeakers. This terribly loud barrage of nonstop Christmas selections continued on all day until "just a few minutes" before 10:00 p.m. I never thought I would resent hearing Christmas carols like "O Holy Night" and "Gingle Bells", but after 10 or 12 hours of listening to this music blaring through our terribly poor sound proofed room, I felt like Manuel Noriega in Panama who had American rock and roll music blared into his hideaway until he finally surrendered to the American troops. I found myself aligning with the likes of Ebeneezer Scrooge, the Grinch and saying "Bah Hum Bug!" as the day progressed and the music continued unabated. Keep in mind that Christmas was five days earlier and we were on the eve of a New Year by the morning of the 31st. I was ready for Frank Sinatra's New York New York and Dick Clark 's Rocking New Year's Eve, but instead I got Andy Williams, the Chipmunks and Charlie Brown's Christmas for fourteen terrible consecutive hours! Even my kids complained when on the morning of January 1, they were awakened by the same terrible barrage of Christmas music "just a few minutes" after 8:00 a.m., when we had gone to sleep "just a few minutes" (relatively) earlier. Enough already with that crap. It was enough to convert me into a Jehovah's Witness. I tried to make it up to them but the $80.00 that it cost to see the ice display that took "just a mere 10 minutes" was a terrible disappointment. The next day I did salvage the vacation by treating everyone to the wonderful Canyon Ranch Spa, where a massage and a facial for the four of us set me back a mere $1000. The total hotel bill with brunch at the buffet and dinner at the quaint Old Hickory Steakhouse was a whopping $3100.00. So next time, "just take a few minutes", shop around, and ice this place from your list, because at a rate of nearly $1000 per day you can go to the Bellagio, a Ritz Carlton, or a Four Season and get terribly good service at a terribly reasonable price.

<Title>“Ice- don't waste your time!!!”
<Content>Went to see the Ice exibit today. Ordered my tickets online in adance- $18 with tax. Got there and had to pay $7 to park as well. Waited an hour to get in- and it took us only 6 minutes to see the whole exhibit. Basically had to dodge all the folks taking pictures of their kids throughout the display. Not nearly what I expected it to be- felt really bad that we had driven 2 hrs plus that I had dragged my husband there. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!

<Title>“It wasn't that great”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights during the month of December. The hotel is decorated beautifully for Christmas and I was upgraded to an atrium room free of charge. It wasn't noisy like I expected, all the entertainment stopped around 8:00.. so getting to bed wasn't an issue. Cons: The (upgraded) room was small, the carpets in hallways are wearing down, and the parking lot could be a 15 minute walk from your room. Pros: It's close to Disney, The Old Hickory Steakhouse is delicious, and the hotel itself is amazing to see. I wouldn't stay here again because of the room quality.

<Title>“Never use the telephone!!! Resort is ok.”
<Content>Having been there for 4 nights attending a conference at Gaylord Palms the hotel itself is very nice. Wonderful pool area (special pool area without children), 24 h/d whirlpool, great interior design, funny to see the little aligators and the feeding of them. The H2O restaurant is ok but nothing special. The hotel is really ok and a perfect spot to visit Disneyland, Seaworld, Cape Canaveral, ... But you should never touch the telephone for international calls. The domestic calls are free (up to 20 min), but I had to call an international number and only reached the voicemail. This 5 sec. calle has been charged for 32 US$. Hotel call rates are expensive, but 32 US$ is not acceptable. The receptionist was helpfull, but it's not acceptable anyway. Stay at the resort and enjoy it, but never call international.

<Title>“Beautiful alternative to Disney!”
<Content>If you want to stay near Orlando but want a more "grown-up" experience, then Gaylord Palms is the place to go. It is a beautiful hotel with top notch restaurants and amenities for the traveler who doesn't necessarily want to be inundated with "kid stuff" their whole vacation. That being said, it is still a very appropriate place for the young ones, but it's nice to stay in Orlando and have an adults-only pool or a choice of fine dining and entertainment that doesn't include a kids menu. The service is excellent and the entire premesis is clean as a whistle. Sure, if you have an atrium room you may hear the entertainment at one of the two bars, but really, you should be down there enjoying it, not sitting in your room grumbling about it. If you really feel the need to leave the hotel (and frankly, you don't need to as it has everything you'd need for an enjoyable vacation right there), Disney's right around the corner and the hotel will provide transportation. The "free" internet is a nice touch as is the bottled water water and the gym (a $10/day resort fee is included). There's croquet, bocce and even an "executive putting course" that's a hoot. Do yourself a favor and check out the gator feedings in the atrium at 6:30 pm. There's so much more to see and do that can't be written here. Gaylord Palms is an excellent choice for the Orlando area.

<Title>“Loved the Gaylord Palms and am planning a return trip!”
<Content>Before I visited the Gaylord Palms to attend a convention with family in tow, I read the many varied reviews on Tripadvisor and was a bit concerned at how mixed they were. It never ceases to amaze me how the same hotel can provide such mixed experiences, but here is my $.02... I have stayed in many Orlando hotels (the Peabody, Marriotts, Dolphin) for numerous reasons (company business trips, conventions, business+family), and I have to say that the experience at the Gaylord absolutely tops the list. First of all, the hotel is close to many attractions and great restaurants but isn't necessarily in the middle of everything. It feels like an oasis from a lot of the hustle and bustle that has come to define Orlando. For this reason, you really need a car to enjoy your stay here. We are admitted foodies and while the food at the hotel is great (for hotel food), we also like to eat at various restaurants around town as well as tour. A car is a must if you want that flexibility. I read that some people felt bound to the hotel without a car, and I can absolutely see how that would be true. The grounds of the hotel are absolutely immaculate, and one gets the sense of approaching a compound when you drive up. Self parking is located on either side of the hotel and once you get used to the swipe card system (swipe in and out to exit), it's no problem. Per the advice of many Tripadvisor travelers, I was very up front about my request for a quiet room as I was traveling with my family and wanted to ensure that we could all sleep when we wanted. I made this request when I made the reservation and followed it up when I was checking in. Our front desk representative more than accommodated us, placing us in the Everglades Wing on the 4th floor, about as far away as one can get from the live music at the bar/restaurant at the opposite end of the building. Our wing was an absolute oasis of quiet and calm throughout our stay. About my only complaint is that the walls are a little thin and the only noise that kept us up was our next-door neighbor watching "Sex and the City" on TV. As for the rooms, they are definitlely a notch above a Marriott hotel room. The $10/day resort fee includes high-speed Internet access, 2 bottles of Dasani water, admittance to the health club and other amenities. You'd pay $10/day just to get Internet access at a Marriott and not much else. The rooms are much larger than most hotels, and the toiletries are generous and high-quality. Housekeeping isn't afraid to provide plenty of towels, either, something we appreciated. The beds were extremely comfortable. From the expedient, friendly check-in to the clean, spacious rooms to the great food had at Villa de Flora (we ate Sunday brunch and a mid-week buffet dinner there), we were quite pleased with our stay at the Gaylord. I told my husband that the staff has taken a pagebook from Disney as their customer service was simply excellent. One night, I was dining alone at the Villa de Flora and told the hostess that I wanted a quiet seat for one. The manager overheard my request and personally took me to a quiet corner of the restaurant that was actually closed off so that I could enjoy some privacy and read my book. As for whether the hotel is appropriate for small children, our daughter absolutely loved walking around the interior of the hotel, marveling at the huge indoor palm trees, anxious to see the "fireflies" (small lights that dim like fireflies) at night on the first level and happy to visit the baby gators and the turtles on the second level. While there is a Ben and Jerry's within the hotel, the Villa de Flora has a Ben and Jerry's section in their dessert area, and that made her day. As for me, I can vouch that the Canyon Ranch Spa is fantastic and boasts the talents of an incredible neuromuscular masseur (Michael) who will soothe you with a tailored massage. While there is shuttle service to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot, we opted to drive our car as we didn't want to be bound by shuttle schedules. The drive was short, and parking was easy. Having been to many Orlando hotels, I can say that our stay at the Gaylord Palms was so comfortable and enjoyable that we are already planning a return trip, this time with even more family members as we are convinced they would enjoy it as much as we did. Do not hesitate to attend a convention here and bring the family!

<Title>“Unfortunate experience”
<Content>I was really looking forward to this hotel based on reviews here and the hotel's own website. My trip was to vacation at Disney World with friends, so I was also looking forward to being located close by and to have such a great kids' pool and play area for the 18 month old in my group. The hotel offered an early check in request which I requested but did not get. I wasn't able to check in until 10 minutes before 3 pm, and didn't get their promised call to my cell phone until after I had already checked in. My room had an overpoweringly toxic detergent/chemical odor. My respiratory/sinus system reacted immediately and I got sick. The room was also unclean. There were drips of dark dried liquid on the desk lamp; drips, dried-on sprays, and smears on the room walls and bathroom walls; and oily smears on the window. The hotel’s website implied that my room might have an upgraded bathroom with separate granite shower and tub. In fact, there was NO bathtub in my room. It is unacceptable to me for a $293++ per night U.S. hotel to not provide a bathtub, and it is unacceptable to me for them not to mention that in the room description. I had nothing but trouble dealing with the staff. The front desk person argued with me, saying that there were windows I could open when there were not. She also told me there were no other rooms available, which was a lie, and made no apology or effort to help, so I said I would have to try to make a reservation somewhere else and check out. I had asked to talk to a manager and was told they were all unavailable. I began looking for a new hotel. The manager eventually called but didn't, nor did anyone ever come to the original room to check on what I was reacting to or experience the extreme odor. She asked if I wanted to think about changing the room (to an even less desirable room), and she asked if an hour would be enough time to decide, and I said yes. I decided to try and find a new hotel and, working as fast as possible, I began to make arrangements. Not five minutes later she called me again and with an irritated tone, asked if I had made a decision. She said I “was now holding up two rooms”. I made my new arrangements elsewhere and called down to let them know I was checking out and leaving. Despite being on the property for less than two hours, I was then physically prevented from leaving the parking lot until I paid the $10 dollars normally charged for overnight parking. After seven days, my first night deposit has just been refunded, but I had to spend several hours dealing with my credit card company to dispute the charge, and have not been refunded the $10 parking fee.

I would like to stay ther again, but their web-site has not been accessible, for over a year!!! I am not exagggerating! Makes you just wonder where their priorities are? By the way, I had an outside room, not on the atrium and it was nice and quiet. The atrium is quite noisy.

<Content>Booked a stay for my son (5 at the time) and myself through Resideo.com a few years ago. I had driven past Gaylord on several occasions, but was unprepared with just how amazing this place really is until we stepped foot inside. The staff was friendly, and our room was very clean and cozy. It looked out over all the areas under the atrium. Will definitely stay here again if given the chance. Very close to Disney World and not too far from Sea World and Universal.

<Title>“For a quieter room...”
<Content>My husband had a buying show at the Gaylord Palms from September 16-21. Before we arrived we thought we might like a room in the Key West section of the hotel but once we got there and checked around we asked for one in the Everglades section and we are really glad we did. The Everglades section of the atrium is very restful with waterfall sounds and piped in cricket and bird noises. The restaurant in that area of the atrium, The Old Hickory steakhouse, is very calm with no entertainment. The Key West section is loud with Sunset Sam's restaurant entertainment and there is a piano bar that you can hear in the St. Augustine and Emerald Bay areas of the atrium. So, if you want a quieter room, definitely ask for one in the Everglades atrium area. We are die-hard Disney fans but we really liked this hotel. The ambiance in the atrium is great and the convention facilities are top-notch. The staff is friendly and very accomodating. The South Beach pool is very nice - there are plenty of chairs and towels and it is an adults-only pool. We watched a Sunday football game in the H2O sports bar - that was fun. We ate dinner at Sunset Sam's and the food was good but pricey. We tried to decide if we would stay at the Gaylord Palms again since we always stay at Disney's Polynesian when we are in Orlando and we decided we would stay there again for a short vacation since the rooms are comparable to Disney rooms and the daily room rate is definitely not as high.

<Title>“An impressive place to stay!”
<Content>A conference I attended was hosted there and much to my surprise, it was an outstanding hotel. My room was much better than expected. Nice matresses, a nicely furnished bathroom (with thick towels). Double french doors to a balcony. The only nit I had was that there was a lot of noise (music) in the interior of the atrium. If you don't have to wake up early, you won't have a problem. Beautiful hotel and nice accomodations! I'd defintely stay there again! Much better than the Disney properties in Orlando.

<Title>“Pretty but inconvenient for the business traveler”
<Content>My husband and I were at the Gaylord for a trade show for a week. This is by far the nicest hotel we have stayed in, in Orlando, much better that the Wilderness Lodge at Walt Disney World. Comfortable beds, lovely pool. If I was vacationing, with adults, I would have rated this above average. The hotel isn't geared for kids or the business traveler. It is more of a of a young adult, cruise ship atmosphere. Surf, turf, drinks with cute names. It is very, very, noisy, until about 1-2AM , due to the piano bar and other entertainment in the atrium. Bring your earplugs and you will be fine. If you aren't willing to use earplugs, stay elsewhere. The beds are really high and you have to climb in and out of them. If you aren't able to climb, stay elsewhere. If you can climb, the beds are great, really comfortable. The big drawback is the lack of a restaurant, with quality, everday food, such as soup, sandwiches,burgers, pasta or eggs and toast. The sort of food normally found in a coffee shop or diner. The resort has the Java Hut, which serves good coffee and a limited selection of bakery goods of very poor quality and truly bad, pre-made sandwiches. You can observe the frozen grocery store type bagels, being set out to defrost and based on the deflated and wrinkly appearance and freezer burn taste of the bagels, I would guess they had been frozen and defrosted several times. The average 7-11 offers more tempting fare. This was odd, becuase the remaining restaurants and room service serve much, much, better quality food. Unfortunately the remaining restaurants and room service, assume you are on vacation and can devote two or more hours to a huge, rich, meal and snooze by the pool to digest it all. The resort also assumes you have the metabolism of a 16 year old boy. Vegetables, fruit and grains are scarce and always cloaked in butter, whipped cream, cheese, or all three. I love rich decadant food, but three times a day for a week, without a break, is not appealing. The cooking style is very plain, hunk "o" meat, hunk "o" fish, starch and several sauces. Spaghetti would have been a real walk on the wild side. Since this resort has its own convention center, it would be nice if it had at least one restaurant, open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, geared to the needs of the business traveler, who doesn't want to consume a stick of butter three times a day, but it doesn't.

<Title>“You'll be very happy here!!!”
<Content>I booked a room at this hotel and was not sure what to expect. I am very picky about where I stay. This hotel is fabulous. The rooms are very clean!!! We had a room which overlooked the atrium. I cannot say enough about the atriums. It is like a city within a hotel. Another person had written in their review about the noise from the atrium, and I didn't hear a thing. The only sound is from the waterfall, which is very nice too me. Some of the restaurants are kind of pricey, but worth the money! The hotel staff is very friendly and will go out of their way to make sure your every request is taken care of. Disney World is about 5 min. away. I like the fact that you can get away from all of the touristy stuff. They have shuttles to/from Disney. They have complimentary town cars to take you to the golf course and offer discounts. My husband played, and said the course was great. He rented clubs at the course. I could say a lot more....but words do not do it justice. This is a 5 star place!!!!!

<Title>“Impressive property”
<Content>We stayed four nights at the Gaylord Palms. The hotel is immediately across the street from the entrance to Disney's Animal Kingdom and around the corner from a road with many national chain restaurants, groceries, etc. The hotel has a free shuttle bus to all the Disney parks and Sea World -- we used it for the Magic Kingdom -- a tip for families with little ones -- the hotel shuttle is a bus that can take strollers without folding them up -- we had a double and so this beat driving ouselves for that very reason. We were very impressed with the property -- 5 acres under glass and -- key for July in Orlando -- all air conditioned!! Other reviewers below complained about noise -- we had an exterior facing room in the St. Augustine section and didn't notice any at all. Other reviewers said a number of the plants were fake in the atrium areas, but we didn't notice any - the running water and natual plants, walking paths, and sitting areas were a HUGE plus for this property in our view. Really unique. The kiddie pool is outside and also huge, clean, and wonderful. Another reviewer below mentioned it is a bit disconcertingly unsupervised and we'd agree with that, but if you keep your kiddies in sight everything should be fine -- nothing negative, just found ourselves worrying other folks kids might get hurt running on the pool deck or sliding down the water slide too close together-- the kiddie pool is huge and our two boys (2 and 4) loved the octopus waterslide and "spitting" sea horses. Also, the continuous entry side of the pool is nice for playing with infants we noticed. There is a nice adult pool on the other side of the property, but we didn't use it. There is a "kidz camp" -- we checked it out but our 2 year old is not fully potty trained so they would only take our 4 year old so we skipped it. It appeared to be supervised, but not adult guided play so I'm not sure it's quite as great as it's billed for little ones, but the 5-10 year olds inside it appeared to be having great fun. The hotel also offered in room babysitting, but at $28/hour for our two kids we decided to take a pass. The hotel's restaurants seemed to be high quality -- we ate at the Key West section boat restaurant and the fish was first rate and fresh. We didn't eat at the steak house or the italian restaurant but they both looked nice. Top prices, but the quality seemed to be there so probably worth it. We did order room service pizza and breakfast. Part of the problem of running an operation of this scale is our pizza arrived late and near burnt but still cold -- but it ended up free because all room service comes with a 30 minute guarantee so not worth any real complaint. The breakfast was ok -- a bit pricey for what you get and not particularly hot, but it did come on time. Surface parking is no problem at this hotel and we skipped the valet because we never had to park more than 5 or 6 rows from a hotel side entrance door. Linens in room are good. Carpet was clean but not new any more. Room furnishings are on par with a nice Hilton or Hyatt, or perhaps a notch better. All rooms have coffee makers, refrigerators and safes, which was nice. They forgot to clean our room one day, but quickly ran towels and coffee and toiletries to us and refused a tip. Again, small service glitches the hazard of running an operation of this size. There was a convention at the hotel and adjacent convention hall while we were there, but the hotel absorbs crowds so well we barely noticed it was there. Overall, we highly recommend this hotel, esp. for Orlando attractions family visitors -- it really couldn't be more convenient or much nicer than it actually is. Also, would recommend this hotel for family reunion functions -- everyone can come and go and get together -- really a nice place for such things. We bid on Priceline for resort and paid just under $100/night. Resort fee and self parking added about $25 per night (incl. tax). Well worth that price for sure. Probably worth anything up to about $200 -- might look at Ritz or a couple of other Orlando properties if going above that price. But the Gaylord Palms is such a unique property nothing else really compares. Very nice.

<Title>“5 Star Disney!”
<Content>Having initially booked this hotel on a name your own price bid on priceline I wasn't quite sure what my family and I were letting ourselves in for! I can honestly say that it was worth every penny. At £50 per night (published rack rate of $500) this was an amazing resort. The price aside the hotel was clean, the rooms were large and furnished to a high standard and the staff were at hand to answer or help with whatever we needed. If I had to give some negative it would have to be the $10 resort fee which they charge regardless of whether you use the resort facilities or not. As well as the parking fee which is either $17 valet or $10 self park. I have stayed at hotels of similar standards and size (Vegas) where the parking is included in the room rate. The only other negative is that this place is so big and has so many restaurants and bars that you could happily stay here and forget that there's so much to do when you are in Orlando. A BIG thumbs up to the Gaylord Palms!

<Title>“What a pool!”
<Content>If you're visiting Disney, then this is the place to stay. My wife was mad at me for only booking two nights during our weeklong stay in Orlando. My 7 year old loved the pool. We had to drag her to Magic Kingdom, she loved it so much. The room was extra clean with first-class touches. Tried out the gym, defintely very nice. Also, plenty of places to eat - but a little pricey. Only downside, the resort fee and self-parking fee add up - we paid $45 for two nights. Otherside, great place, we'll be back next time we're in Orlando.

<Title>“Small rooms but LOTS to do at this Hotel”
<Content>I was not impressed with the size of the rooms, especially the small bath area. But the view from the Atrium view balcony was nice. We over looked the wedding pavillion and there was a wedding during our stay. The pools were nice, and we enjoyed them even late into the night. Also the 24 hour coffee-snack cafe was a nice plus for midnight snacks. Room service was mediocure. It was expensive and just not really that great. We tried to use the soda machines on the floor, but they would not work with our room keys and had no place to put actual money in. There was something in the air handler that made our eyes water, not sure what that was, but it was quite irritating. We've never had that happen before. Towels and sheets seemed clean, and they do give you lots of pillows. Shampoo and soaps were nice. We did think the restaurants were expensive, so we went to SR #192 and found a place to eat that was a lot cheaper. There was a fridge in the room with two bottles of water, that was nice. Adequate number of television channels. The security guard did ask to see our Room Key while we were at the pool late, but we found him "Lenny" to be quite nice, and were glad he was there watching out for us. Security is a good thing. We felt quite safe everywhere at this resort, the atrium especially late at night. Friendly employees cleaning and tending to the plants. Just wish the room was bigger, the food less expensive. hey, you can't have everything.

<Title>“Not worth your money!”
<Content>We decided to try this hotel because of all the great things we'd heard. Hey it's a 5 star, we're paying $270 a night, everything should be perfect right?! Wrong!!! We spent $100 for 2 adults & 2 children at the Fish Camp (which did have a great entertainment) but found a fruit nat in my margarita). We had an atrium view (which was pretty neat) in the St Augustine wing. However, upon turning our beds down our sheets were full of hair and even possibly a dried blood stain. There was also a hair in one of our bath towels. We immediately called the Front Desk and our sheets were changed. I have to agree with previous reviews that having an atrium view was very noisy. Of course our kids were worn out from walking around Sea World all day, but I had to stuff my ears with tissue. Then at 5:30AM the fire alarm went off!!! We made our way down to the stairwell exit closest to our room in our pj's only to find the access door at the bottom was locked. We had to come all the way back up to the fifth floor and called the Front Desk, where no one answered. We looked down from the balcony and figured that this pretty much was a false alarm or drill as people seemed pretty lax walking around. Well obviously it was, because we're not dead!!! We spent about $50 just on breakfast! Not recommended for a family, especially when you're spending so much money already on the theme parks.

<Title>“Stay here only if you are attending a Convention”
<Content>I just returned from a weekend stay, due to an all day seminar at this hotel. The hotel was beautiful and so were the rooms. Its is very close to Disney. There were some negatives to this hotel. I did not like the set up of the rooms. The balconies are facing the inside atrium and as others have said, which makes the rooms very noisy and there are no windows to see the outside. I found this very annoying since it was raining on and off the whole weekend. We never new if the weather was good or bad when we wanted to take the kids to the pool or out to dinner. Also check-in was horrible. We had requested early check-in and adjoining rooms for the family. Well we did not get either. They kept telling us to check back, but our rooms were not available till 3:00 p.m. They also had one room booked on the 4th Floor and one room on the 6th Floor. Which the did eventually fix. They also ony had 2 people checking in guests when the hotel was sold out. The check-in line was long...and so was everything else ( like all the restaurants). The hotel was beautiful but I would not stay at this hotel again unless I had to attend another seminar here. There are too many other beautiful hotels at this price range.

<Title>“Had a nice stay”
<Content>Recently returned from five night stay at the Gaylord. Wife and neice tagged along as I attended a conference. I was a bit leary going in as many of the reviews here were negative. Check in went smooth, arrived at noon and got to check in right away. Front desk staff was friendly, although very rude at check out . LIterally threw the invoice at me with out as much as a thank you or did you enjoy your stay. She won't last with that attitude. (5:30 am on 6/11). Our room was very nice, stayed in the Everglades section on top floor, with atrium view. Only noise we heard was the water moving below, very calming actually. Other areas did seem noisy, adjacent to piano bar, and the sounds do stay inside the enclosure.. I'd strongly recommend the Glades section if you want atrium view. Room was clean, although mildew on shower curtain. I agree the parking and "resort" fee are big profit maker, but you know going in they will charge $20 per day. Pools were very nice. We ate at pool bar(H2o) on first day, prices were resonable. Ventured out to eat, make right onto International Drive down to 192(go left). Plenty of places, including decent breakfast buffet at Ponderosa for $ 3.99. Also, Publix right there for snacks water, etc. Food prices were actually good , compared to the Northeast. If you eat at the Gaylord, bring your wallet. Rental car was a good move. We did not take shuttle to parks, but I did inquire one day. After hotel operator put me on hold for ten minutes, she reported busses run at 90 minute intervals. Last thing you want after the parks, is more waiting. $9 per day at parks(can be used at all four). Overall, Gaylord was a fine place to stay, although at $199 plus tax and the $20 "clip" fee, probably find better deals if on a tight budget. Gladly answer any questions, shoot me an email..

<Title>“Wonderful place”
<Content>Just came back after 3 nights at the Gaylord Palms. Got a price of about $90 per night via priceline--- (price on Gaylord's website was $199). The hotel is like a destination in itself and it takes a while to orientate yourself. Asked for a room with an atrium view, but all were taken due to a convention. Instead, we were upgraded to an Emerald Bay room on the 7th floor, with a view of the children's pool. Didn't eat at any of the restaurants. US-192 is just a couple of minutes' drive away with all the usual eateries available. Loved the inroom computer with internet access. This should become standard in all hotels! The tv is ok, but it's not widescreen nor flatscreen. It can be a long walk from self parking to the lobby. Upon arrival, a shuttle took us to the front desk. We tried to find a short cut through the convention center when bringing in the bags and ended up walking through employee corridors. We got a few funny looks, but eventually found our way back to the room. Later, we discovered it's best to park close to the Key West entrance and take the lift up to the first floor. Then you can get to anywhere you like fairly easily. The pools are nice, but for such a huge hotel, we thought they should have been bigger. The kids pool was crammed most of the time (Memorial Day weekend) and we also found it interesting, and perhaps disturbing, that kids were in the pool around the clock, seemingly without any parents checking on them. On the first day, children also 'hijacked' lifts and went up and down, causing some annoyance to other guests. It felt like a privilege to stay at this hotel and it's wonderful to walk around, especially outside in the evening. Everything is clean and looked after. This hotel is so different from any other hotel I've been to. We had no regrets and it was definitely a memorial stay!

<Title>“Nice Convention Hotel”
<Content>I recently attended a Trade Show in Orlando and had the good fortune of staying at the Gaylord Palms Hotel and Convention Center. To set the record straight, this in not a good hotel for families. As convention hotels go - it is way above average. The setting is both tasteful and relaxing and the staff is outstanding. Of particular note was the exceptional service provided by the housekeeping staff. The daily maid service I received was flawless. From turndown service every evening to a spotlessly clean bathroom, I could not have asked for more. The in-room computers with FREE high speed internet are an interesting amenity. Be assured that "FREE" is a relative term. In truth, to use the internet on the in-room pc you are agreeing to allow the Gaylord Entertainment Group's IT staff to profile your surfing habits for future marketing endeavors. Kind of pecuilar... The room service was outstanding at the Gaylord. In particular, the 30 minute or less guarantee for delivery is very impressive. The quality and the presentation of the food were superior, too. The food in the Convention Center at my company's functions was way better than the usual convention fare and was complemented by prompt and courteous service. Yes, the daily resort fee and prices in general are a bit high but you get what you pay for. The Gaylord obviously takes quality control very seriously and it translates into a superior experience in every regard.

<Content>Very impressive interior and great amenities. Our room were right above the bar at "Key West" and it was kind of noisy before 10pm when the live band was playing. It is great to have the kids pool and adult pool seperated where we could enjoy a moment of tranquility. The food at pool side restaurant wasn't impressive, however, MUST ORDER the big icy cocktail from the bar, it will cool you down in a summer day. Reaonsable priced and above average buffet at Villa de Flora was the highlight of our trip. Me and my husband will definitely come back for a long weekend.

<Title>“OK experience. Rooms adequate.”
<Content>We went to the Gaylord Palms for Mothers Day and had an adequate experience. We checked in and had no problem with the check in. We got to our room and the overwhelming paint fumes had us call and request a new room (my wife is pregnant). When we got to the new room, it had a nice view of the atrium. The room was adequate for the money paid. The real problem started when at 12:30 at night an obnoxious noise woke us up from the atrium. After about 20 minutes we called the front desk and they told us they were pressure cleaning inside. If I stayed again I would not get an atrium view so that I could get some sleep.

<Title>“Beautiful Resort”
<Content>We just returned from a week at the Gaylord Palms, vacation and conference combo. The hotel is impressive, I must say. We had no trouble getting there from the airport via shuttle. The Gaylord website gives the impression that they have a special arrangement with Mears for a better price, but we used Beeline for the same one. (hint: when checking in, drop off your bags at Bell Services, it is a long walk to most rooms) Our room was lovely, located in the St. Augustine section, close to the lobby. We took the advice of other Tripadvisor members and did not opt for an atrium view. Things did get loud down there sometimes, but I must admit to being a bit envious of the people with their balcony doors open in the mornings, enjoying the atmosphere. Our bellman showed us the features of our room (getting the ceiling fan going), and showing us all about the computer. Not only can one surf the Web, the day's meetings (with map) is listed. We ordered extra towels and linens (via computer), which arrived within 15 minutes of our arrival. Likewise for razor and shaving cream later on in the week. Our only problem with the room were the electronic keys which were VERY picky, requiring multiple resets. The facilities were beautiful-- Pools, hot tubs, walkways, waterfalls, restaurants. I personally felt very safe and comfortable walking around alone at any time. Staff was friendly and helpful. The Gaylord Palms is quite capable of handling multiple groups at once. Often central areas of the atrium and once the adult pool were cordoned off for "a very special group function." This never seemed to block traffic, however. But lines at the coffee shop could get long. Expect to spend money on food. The buffet at Villa de Flora is great, and worth the money. I loved the scallops at Sunset Sams, but who wants to pay a minimum of $30 every night. To-Go lunches at the conference ran about $10. This place is isolated, no short walk across the street to another restaurant! As nice as the family pool is, I do see this place as being better suited for conventioneers and such and not the large family vacation. Its isolation and dearth of outside food options would make me think before staying here again, as much as I enjoyed this stay. Perhaps once was enough.

<Title>“Lots of glitz, no soul”
<Content>What a huge disappointment. It's in the middle of nothing (you can't even walk to shops) and the charge to park your car (even for just a few hours) is $10. Unheard of in Orlando, until this Nashville company built this monstrosity. When checking in just before my convention began, I was quoted a rate that was $60 more than what the negotiated rate was for the convention (the reservation was made through the meeting planners). Watch that if you're unfortunate enough to have to stay here. The whole undeclared theme of the hotel seems to be "separate the visitor from his/her money". Restaurants and shops are very expensive and I did not find the facility to be all that clean. The workers seem to spend a lot of time talking to one another, sitting together in unused meeting rooms and joking with one another, but rooms go uncleaned and trash cans are rarely emptied. Another example: The much-touted (putting) golf course has not been kept up in a long time and sand from the bunkers is spread all over the course. Note even playable. This place hosts a lot of huge conventions and it probably rakes in the dough for its owners, so it does what it was designed to do. As a resident of Florida, let me tell you the Florida depicted inside the dome is NOT what Florida is like. Do yourself a favor and venture outside. Another person at my convention summed this hotel up well: "This is like staying on a very bad cruise ship". Amen!

<Content>We had kind of mix feelings for Gaylord Palm. We like everything except the "room" that we stayed for 2 nights. The room is small, the bath tub is dirty(a lot of hairs), the Carpet is not so clean, bath towel and bedsheet with holes. It seems like that the Gaylord pays a lot of attention at the facilities around the hotel. But they forget people do not just come for the great view and wonderful swimming pool. We also expect a clean and nice room to rest at night, especially for the price they charged.

<Title>“do any of the rooms have views....?”
<Content>we had two nights at the gaylord palms - saturday 1st april and thursday 6th april - on route to and from the keys. the hotel is huge and luxurious with a lovely pool area - although we only sat here for a short time - there was a problem with the number of sunbeds on that occasion (sat evening). i believe that the resort fee covers the use of the inroom computer, coffee, newspaper etc.and two bottles of water. $10 + tax. on one occasion we got water and one one occasion we got a paper - we didn't let the housekeeping dept know about these shortcomings but if we had i am sure that they would have been quickly addressed. i think the biggest disappointment with the hotel is the resort fee AND then parking fees - these add an additional $22+ a night to a stay(which is around another 20% to the rate i achieved on priceline - $93/96 + taxes and fees) i can almost accept the resort fee but feel that the parking cost should be included in that - it has been in other hotels we have stayed at (whether i have had a car or not). anyway the inroom computer was very useful and much better to us when on holiday than free or cheap internet access - on holiday we don't tend to take a laptop. my husband liked the hotel and i think it is okay - although on the two occasions we were there we did get awful views over the carpark - priceline perk? i have mixed feelings about the place - i prefer the renaissance near sea world but it was an okay stay for one night at a time - i don't think i'd like it for an extended stay.

<Content>What a great place to stay! Highly recommended for business and leisure travellers. The pools are great and so is the outside dining! We especially liked the atrium with the alligators and other exhibits. The buffet was fantastic! I would definately stay at the Galyord Palms again. It was a great experience!

<Title>“Loved it!”
<Content>Our daughter is a Disney employee (or cast member, as they say) and we wanted to go to Orlando and spend the night while she was off, without going to the parks. I got a good deal on Priceline (which, of course did not include the $10 resort fee or the $10 for self parking) and was very very happy with the property. We had an atrium room in the St. Augustine section. Despite other comments on this site, we didn't have a noise problem. I think next time, if I was going to make a request, I would ask for an atrium room in the Everglades section close to the spa and fitness center. I don't think there would be a noise problem there, and it is gorgeous. We had drinks and appetizers in the Key West section on the boat (there is a bar on the boat which is in one of the atrium ponds/lakes, stoked with native fish). Entertainment in Key West, at sunset, included live music, guys on stilts, magic tricks, plate spinning and balloon animals. We ordered the calamari (good) and the pulled pork on polenta (which my husband said was very good) and two of their specialty drinks. The bill was high, but I thought the value was good. I would definitely stay at the Gaylord Palms again, especially for the price. Loved it! Flowers everywhere. It was like being in a terrarium. Had my daughter not insisted on Downtown Disney, I would have happily stayed at the hotel the whole time.

<Title>“Terrific! Don't miss the Old Hickory Steakhouse or drinks at Key West!”
<Content>We stayed here for a two-day seminar, had a standard room but splurged on the Old Hickory Steakhouse and were glad we did. We ate "outside" on the porch and felt like we were truly deep in the Everglades--except no bugs! We split their signature steak and our waiter could not have been more gracious. He broght two entree plates prepared with accompaniments. Sharing the entree gave us an excuse to try an appitizer, salads, and desserts. Great meal. We enjoyed a drink at sunset "aboard" the schooner "sailing" at the Key West restaurant. This 60-foot sail boat sits at a simulated dock in a huge pool. At Happy Hour various jugglers, clowns, fire eaters, stilt walkers, and muscians entertain the crowd. It's better than Mallory Square in the real Key West! We parked our own car and avoided the waits for valet parking. The hotel is so large it's likely to be a hike from either the lot or the front entrance, so the parking lot worked fine for us.

<Title>“Many problems”
<Content>While a magnificently beautiful property, they forgot after they built it they had to manage it! The "consider it done" button was a joke...many requests were just plainly ignored. Many minor items never fixed (makeup mirror light, coffeemaker,etc., never replaced). Staff was semi-helpful. Room service is delivered in 30 minutes or its free - 2 out of 3 of ours was free! Definitely not a 4 star property. No cars to take you anywhere - its a $40 cab ride to shopping. No shuttle. Was there on a convention - had I been paying, I would have been incensed with the service.

<Title>“Relaxing Entertainment for Family”
<Content>We chose this hotel because we wanted a fun, relaxing weekend in Orlando with our children (ages 7, 5 and 3) without going to Disney. The enclosed atrium is enormous with lots of different areas to explore, so the kids were able to wander around for ages looking at interesting things. This, combined with a great kids pool, water slide, kids spa pool and play area, meant that they could have fun and expend a lot of energy while we felt relatively relaxed. The kids loved being able to go in a spa pool since it is prohibited at some hotels. This was much appreciated on our weekend in February when the temperatures were a bit cool, especially for the night swim. The big pool was nicely heated, but they loved jumping in the spa to get hot. There is also a separate, large "adults-only" pool & spa pool area. The kids also spent an hour in a great play space ($10/child or $25/3 children) while we went out on our own. The woman who worked there was lovely with children, and they practically had this great facility to themselves. They easily would have spent hours there if we'd allowed it. Our room was spacious with two double beds. One bonus is that they allow families with 3 children to share one room. Many Disney hotels have a maximum occupancy of 4 people (they wouldn't allow our 3 year-old to sleep in a sleeping bag on the floor), so families of 5 need to book two rooms or get a suite. The indoor/outdoor restaurant by the pool is reasonably priced. We had another meal in the Key West area of the hotel - pricier, but also very entertaining with a piano player/singer and other live performers. The large breakfast buffet on Sunday had a tremendous variety of food. Not inexpensive, but good value as the meal served as breakfast and lunch (plus, age 3 and under are free). The kids had a great time, and we relaxed. Note: Try to catch the alligator feeding show (only 3 times per week). Alligators were OK to see at other times, but the young guy doing the feeding put on a terrific show.

<Title>“Impresive convention property”
<Content>This place is truly amazing! Its feel is more like a Las Vegas hotel. It is huge and caters to convention business. It is really a resort that you do not need to leave (except to visit the theme parks). It does not have the same feel of a disney hotel though. No tired parents dragging around their kids. I was told by an employee that it is about 75% business travelers and 25% vacationers. There was plenty of entertainment and a few pools (with water slide). Every Room has it's own computer! Service was very good on my stay. Located about 3 miles from disney parks. If you do not stay at a Disney Hotel this is a winner. It is a good choice in the summer too because the gigantic atrium is air conditioned.

<Title>“Beware of Conventions”
<Content>I will have to admit that the Gaylord Palms is one of the most beautiful places I have ever stayed. The SPA and staff were wonderful also. I would just like to warn people who are going there to relax and enjoy the Atrium Rooms to "Beware of the Conventions" I know that the conventions are the bread and butter of this place but the noise each nite was terrible. The fist 3 nites at the Hotel as soon as the Piano Bar seemed to close the partys moved to the room beside us. The last nite they actually had a live band playing until after 11 O'Clock at nite in the Atrium. No way to sleep. Some of the Convention crowd had their own hand held air horns and they continued to blow until the wee hours of the morning. As we prepared to leave the next morning there were beer cans and bottles in the hallway getting to the elevator. The elevator broke the day before check out and the computers were down when we went to check out. So we were e-mailed our bill. I could of got that kind of room at a local dormatory. Not what I expected for the price. I would say if you are going for a convention or party it would be great. For a family or a relaxing getaway....well maybe not! I guess it depends on the convention.

<Title>“Felt like living in a mansion”
<Content>We stayed at the Gaylord Palms for 3 nights during the last week of December. The hotel was extremely easy to find right off I-4 and Osceola Parkway. Arrival/Check In: We arrived during the evening hours of Christmas day, stopped off at a Walgreens that opened until 9pm and stocked up on some snacks, breakfast foods, and drinks because the hotel had fridges in each room. We parked our car in their vast lot in the back of the hotel. Most of the cars were parked there to see their ICE show. We walked through the atrium and after a 5 minute walk, we made it to the front. (Truthfully, it was my own fault for parking first before checking in.) We had bought the hotel off of priceline, $100 a night and it was very well worth it. We requested a King room, higher up and facing outside because we read that it can get noisy from the shows that are happening in the atrium. Service was excellent and our requests were well received. We had a room in the Evergreen area, which was just what we wanted, and we were given a double treat...windows facing outside toward the pool area and windows facing the atrium. It wasn't that noisy. The Evergreen area has a separate exit/entrance to the parking lot so you do not have to waste time walking all the way around the hotel. Rooms: Very clean, safe in room, fridge stocked with 2 bottles of disani water each day, computer with internet. The computer was most helpful--able to look up directions, request items for housekeeping, quick check out. Location: Hotel is sorta secluded. You do need a car in order to get to International drive and other areas for food. I did not eat in the hotel because it was just too expensive. It's very close to Disneyworld, only 5 minutes away. They have complimentary shuttle to Disney but I cannot comment on them. Cons: The resort fee is about $10 per day but it doesnt cover the parking fee--$10 per night. Overall, this is a great resort. I would definitely go there again.

<Title>“Atrium wonderful, but easy to get lost & service hit and miss”
<Content>The Gaylord Palms Atrium was wonderful, especially the waterfalls, the koi ponds, and the turtle/alligator area. What a way to relax after a long day. However, it was very easy to get lost even with the signs; maps would have been better than simple arrows. As an exhibitor at the convention, it was great having everything so well contained; the business center was conveniently located in the convention area. But, the people behind the counter were less than stellar. They had run out of FedEx large boxes -- surprising since they knew a 3000 person convention was coming! -- and didn't have anything suitable for me to ship with. Sure, it sounds a bit mundane, but to be told that I have to "figure it out for myself" at a 4-star, $220+/night hotel was insulting. Although I had reserved a king room, I ended up with a double. I was so tired when I checked in at 2 a.m. the first night that I didn't complain; since I was so busy with the convention, I didn't bother changing rooms. Housekeeping was especially efficient and pleasant. Kudos to the high speed internet connection in the rooms; the computer was a nice touch! The food was excellent, albeit expensive. We had a catered event in a suite -- cerviche and an antipasto buffet -- and my team was pleasantly surprised at the quality. The wait staff was fantastic as well, allowing us to keep the food and drinks well past the designated "clean up" time. As for the onsite restaurants, they were very expensive but the food was good except at the 24-hour cafe, which was underwhelming. My biggest complaint, however, was with the valet parking service. Again, I was so tired when I checked in at 2 a.m. that when the valet offered to park my car, I said go ahead. He was kind and attentive, and I did have a lot of boxes to carry for our exhibit. But everytime I went to get my car, it was an ordeal. Once, I had to wait over 20 minutes for my car even though I had requested it via the online service 20 minutes before that! It would not have been so aggrevating if six other people came after me and almost immediately got their cars ahead of me. They apologized for the poor service but every time I requested my car, it was a 20 minute wait. As a convention exhibitor, the Gaylord is very nice (far better than the Disney property last year) and I wouldn't mind another show here. However, I don't know if I would be willing to spend the $$ to stay here on vacation.

<Title>“Outstanding facility superior service”
<Content>Resort is unbelievably beautiful. There are numerous pools, open 24 hours a day. inside atrium is landscaped to look like a tropical rainforrest. Includes numerous ponds with fish and a specific pond area with live alligators. Facility has numerous amenities- and restaurants. Restaurants are very high priced, a hamburger is approximately 18$. I ordered room service for my children, a 10" plain cheese pizza and chicken nuggets/fries and a 8oz gingerale. bill was 33$. Tips are to either bring your own drinks/snacks and if possible eat outside of resort if you are looking to save money. We were in resort day before daytona 500 and kissimee was nuts- could not find a place to eat - even had problems getting waited on at mcdonalds. dennys; waited 45 minutes -waitress never showed; and other restaurants had wait of 45 minutes to almost 2 hours. after a long day on the road, we were exhausted and hungry. so don't come to this town hungry; eat on the outskirts. the facility charges you to park, 10 $ for self parking and more for valet parking. also- charges you for an "activity fee" which gives you access to all pools, gym, and internet access in room with a pc. the grounds are absolutely beautiful. We got this room by bidding on a room on priceline- we bid 100$ and checked off 4 start or a resort. we got the room for $100 plus a $20 fee for priceline, then the $20 for parking and activity fee. all told, $140 - it was worth it, the place is gorgeous and beds are very comfortable. If i stayed here again, i'd want to say longer so i could enjoy the ammenities. rack rate on rooms i reviewed were about 279+ up to 500 a night. we really got a great deal through priceline.

<Title>“Beautiful, but service suffers”
<Content>Clearly, the Gaylord Palms is a stunning hotel and a pleasure to walk around in. Service, unfortunately, was lacking the week I was there, most notably at the eateries. The room was satisfactory, but the bed comfort was lacking in comparison to the room price. All other room amenities were average. Housekeeping was excellent. But there were concern: Concern 1 came at Sunset Sams, where seating was slow (open tables) and what was ordered wasn't what was received. Because it took so long, I accepted the meal, but no amends were made by the restaurant. Concern 2 came at the H20 Sports Bar, where we sat for no less than 10 minutes and not one of the wait staff even acknowledged us, though there was eye contact. We left. Concern 3 came with the room, which, though a non-smoking room, was clearly used otherwise. Kudos, however, to the effective use of an ionizer to rid the smell, but it required that I leave to have this done. Concern 4 was in the convention center, where there was little information at all about where our training sessions were to be held. The most helpful were the guys setting out sodas for another convention's event. Concern 5 was with the concierge, who, in spite of our attempt to explain that we were looking for a down-to-earth jazz bar, found ourselves with a printout for two very upscale restaurants. Unfortunately, the standoff-ish attitude of the concierge made us decide to figure it out on our own. (Must've been the jeans we were wearing at the time.) Concern 6 was a billing error, which resulted in about a 20 minute delay at checkout. Concern 7 was the misfired response to an online survey I completed after my stay. I was contacted by someone there via email asking for the best time to contact me. After three replies to this person, I gave up. Recommendation: It's always convenient to be colocated at the same hotel as your convention, but here don't get your hopes up too high. If you're traveling for pleasure, there are sure to be better values at higher quality with the service you'd expect at such prices.

<Title>“Wonderful Place (expect to pay extra)”
<Content>This is an excellent place to stay, as long as you are aware of the extra expenses. We read all the reviews before we stayed so we knew what to expect. The rooms are very nice and the atrium view is wonderful. I will stay again. Just make sure to drink the water, use the soap, lotion and coffee every day because they charge you the extra resort fee anyway. We paid $190.00 room with atrium view, $16.00 a day for valet parking (this was worth it) $10.00 a day for resort fee. All and all a Beautiful place to stay. Very Friendly Staff.

<Title>“Wonderful - Different than other hotels”
<Content>My husband and I traveled (no kids) to Orlando between Christmas and New Years (2005). We stayed at numerous hotels during this visit. In part because we plan to return with our children and wanted to 'scope out' the hotels. We have previously stayed at Gaylords in Nashville. This hotel is close to Disney (very close to the Wide World of Sports - WWS - complex). Because of WWS tournaments the Gaylord had tons of kids - someone at the hotel advised 600 kids playing at the WWS checked in on 1 night of our stay. We thought we would feel overwhelmed with kids but we didn't. This hotel is great for adults and for families. The atrium (evergrades) is what sets it apart. They had performances in the atrium. They have shops, adult pool, family pool, 3 bars, etc. I could have simply stayed at the hotel all day and not felt like I 'missed' a thing. There was an ICE show in the connected Convention Center which looked amazing but we did not see it as we are from the north and have enough cold temperatures! We dined at the Old Hickory Steakhouse. Prior to going we read reviews. We parked ourselves with no problem and knew parking would be $7.50. Some reviews of the Old Hickory Steakhouse complained about the prices. Gaylords has 3 dining options. We elected to eat at the Steakhouse ($$$). My husband and I had a wonderful 'dining experience' at the steakhouse. I had one of the very BEST meals I have ever had in any restaurant. Yes, it was expensive but it was ABSOLUTELY supurb. Because they were booked we ate at the bar and actually ordered 2 appetizers and then split one (steak) meal. What I liked is that the waitresses suggested this when I mentioned that I didn't want too much. They brought an extra plate and were very gracious, funny. It was wonderful. I think, with drinks and tip, we spent around $60-80 and it was worth every cent. For adult entertainment we took a taxi ($15) to Downtown Disney (Pleasure Island). I thought this was an adult venue but it was overrun with kids. I didn't quite get that and I think it was because it was still earlier in the evening (7-8pm) and not 10-11. I did like the fact that the 'taxis' from Gaylord were more sedans (limo style). We had a Florida room (aka faces out) with a king bed. I asked for a room on the upper floors and we had a fabulous view of Orlando from the 8th floor. Decor was excellent, high-end, immaculate. The room was spacious. Maids turned down the beds in the evening. We plan to return to this hotel.

<Title>“Absolutely Perfect!!”
<Content>My wife & I stayed here for ten days and every day was just wonderful. The rooms were clean, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was definitely "tropical". It's the atrium that makes this hotel special and although it's a large resort, you never have that crowded feeling. You will spend a little extra (parking fee and a "resort fee") but the conceirge and other services make up for it. The only negative we encountered was, one night they would not take reservations for dinner at the Villa de Flora, and so we did not attempt to make reservations for the following night and when we got there at dinner time, they said all seatings were "booked". We had to wait over an hour for a table (and this was buffet style). If you can find room rates for $150 to $160/night -- book it!! (here's a little secret -- make a right out of the parking lot onto International Drive. Go about a half-mile south and you "T" into Orlo Bronson Drive. You will find all of the chain resturants (Cracker Barrel, IHop, Chili's, etc)

<Title>“Great”
<Content>This is my fourth night of a five night stay. I couldn't be more impressed with a facility. This hotel is lovely and grand in every way. I followed the advice of an earlier trip advisor review and requested an outside room, for quieter evenings. The inside rooms have french doors opening out to the lovely atrium. It's a fabulous space, but they do perform shows every night, and the could get irritating if you are here for more than a night or two. Right now the hotel is doing their Christmas show, which is actually wonderful (but not if you have to listen to it night after night). Food and service at the Villa de Flora is very good for a buffet. They do try to change many of the dishes nightly. The parking lot is a bit of a walk, but I am not sure how it could be otherwise. The pools and pool areas are lovely. Overall, you could pay a lot more for a lot less! This hotel is extremely well located to get to the Disney parks. While I am not here for that, and probably won't go to any, I would recommend it for it's proximity if that is what you are here for. But if you are not, such as me, you can avoid all the Disney places very easily.

<Title>“Pure Heaven”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our anniversary. If you are looking for peace and relaxation with a touch of beauty this is the place. The rooms and halls are so quiet you almost feel like you are in a library. We had an Emerald Bay room with a balcony. The hotel had already decorated for the holidays which just added to the beauty of this hotel. Then there is the entertainment of Christmas carols. As for the staff, they are top rated. They add all the final touches to this beautiful hotel. Everyone is friendly with a smile and a hello. Not just the ones that have to interact with you, but the ones that you pass throughout the hotel. And if it is food that you are looking for, look no further. We had the most incredible dinner at Old Hickory Steakhouse, everything is ala carte but well worth the experience. The breakfast buffet is also wonderful. I have always been able to find some small flaws in other hotels, but this one is at the top of the scale!

<Content>Stayed in a very nice, clean room. However, the room was well over $200 a night, and the restaurants were very expensive (a rather ordinary hamburger was $12). Shuttle service to Disney was somewhat slow. There are MANY other less expensive alternatives in the area. If you stay here, bring plenty of money!

<Title>“Not worth the money, did not meet expectations”
<Content>It took them 6 hours to get our second room (we had 2 rooms because we took our kids), maid service was very slow, they normally cleaned the rooms in the late afternoon. The staff was not friendly nor helpful. I wanted to wash some of the kids clothes but the change machine in the laundry room was broken, I went to the front desk, then the concierge only to be told by both they don't have any change. The food was sub standard so if we were going to be at the hotel for the day we went out to eat. They charge for parking each day and an additional $10.00 resort fee . They have two pools, one adult and one for kids but one day they closed the pool from 12:00 pm to 8:00 pm for a private party so we could not use the pool. I was by the pool at 2:30 that day and did not see anyone there so I did not understand why they closed it so early or why they did not just close the adult pool. I can think of several other places I would have rather spent my money, not worth the $3,500.00 we spent!

<Title>“Well run, comfortable hotel -- unique setting”
<Content>I just got back yesterday from a 4-day conference at the Gaylord. They have conferences down to a science. Everything was coordinated very well. The meals, the party to Universal Studios... Considering there were 2000 attendees, the fact that you didn't have to wait for food at mealtime is amazing. The room was big and the bathroom luxurious. The setting is fun; kind of like a combination Biosphere 2 and shopping mall and botanical gardens. The pool looked inviting but alas, the conference took up all my time. The food was decent although many of the food items seemed stale. Fresh-squeezed OJ at breakfast was nice as was the blueberry quick bread. Since the conference provided all the food, I did not suffer the sticker shock of the hotel restaurants. I was there three nights. Sunday and Tuesday nights were quiet--just the sound of the "waterfalls". However, Monday night, there were some noisy people hooting it up in the atrium. I was in the Everglades section on the 2nd floor overlooking the Old Hickory restaurant. The room, however, did suffer from lack of attention to detail. There were no bottles of water in my room, the TV was unplugged, and the safe was broken. All in all, I enjoyed the hotel. The service was pretty good. It was the best-run conference I have ever been to.

<Title>“Worst hotel experience Ever”
<Content>We arrived on Oct 21 late for checking in and asked if we could get a room not close to the street with one king bed. The person who checked us in said they don't have anymore kingbed so we asked if we could get an upgrade. Then she pretended to call somebody ask delibelate the conversation like she's talking to supervisor and said no. Since we're pretty exhaust we said OK just gave us a two queens room. She sent us to one of the furthest rooms they have (took about 8 mins to walk there from the lobby) and it's next to the street. We were so frustrated and called back the frontdesk when another person picked up. He's kind enough to change the room for us but took about 1 hour for someone to bring us new key room. The room was so so and there's a leak in the shower. Hotel charge $10 extra for resort fee each night plus another $8 for parking everyday if you bring your own car. I will never stay at this hotel again given the mean service and too many hidden fees.

<Title>“Too noisy for the price”
<Content>I had stayed at the Gaylord Opryland hotel in the past and thought it was great. So when business travel took me to Orlando, I was very excited to stay in another Gaylord property. I arrived during daylight hours and checked in with no problems. The room was clean and overlooked the atrium in the Everglades section of the hotel. The view was lovely although I did look down later to discover previous guests had some success throwing a few pieces of garbage (napkins, cigarettes and one chicken bone) on top of the coffee shop roof. My biggest problem came at night. The place is NOISY!! In my section of the hotel, the open atrium features an all-night coffee shop. My first night there a group camped out until 2 a.m. laughing and yelling after clearly having a few too many adult beverages. Felt like I was sleeping (unsuccessfully) next to a college campus. The next night and every night of my stay, the piano bar with its doors open into the atrium kept me awake until they closed at 1 a.m. Turns out that lovely balcony's glass windows and window treatments aren't really enough to keep out the Billy Joel "Pianoman" Wannabee's singing until all hours. If I was vacationing, I don't know that I would have minded the noise and would have just compensated by sleeping in during the mornings. But since I was travelling on business, I needed to be out of the door by 8:15 every morning and was suffering from severe sleep deprivation by the time I got home. As has been noted in other reviews, the prices for in-hotel food are quite high although were comparable to other Disney properties at which I've stayed over the years. Paying additional for parking didn't reflect great guest services, in my opinion, but I also acknowledge is fairly standard for the area. On the plus side, the staff was very nice especially the housekeepers I met and the servers in the restaurants. The alligators in the lobby make for a good show and the grounds are quite beautiful. Didn't have time for the spa but did take advantage of the in-hotel workout space which, while smaller, is well stocked with up-to-date equipment. The room was very clean, ample towells were provided and I did appreciate the complementary bottled water put in the room fridge each day. The food is very good especially breakfast at the buffet. If I were to stay again, I'd definitely ask for a room with an exterior view to avoid the noise coming from the atrium. Or ask for a room away from the center of the hotel, where most of the action happens.

<Title>“Gaylord Palms was an incredible hotel!!”
<Content>We stayed at the Gaylord Palms resort from the 6th until the 13th of august. In one word it was awesome. I genuinely believed that the wow factor would have disappeared because I had spent so much time on the internet looking through pictures and reading reviews about different aspects of the hotel. The novelty never wore off. When we first arrived we were in awe at the scale and beauty of this building. It was very pictureque, especially when lit up at night. Getting in with all our luggage was slightly troublesome (mainly because we opted to park before checking in with our bags and there was no bell service in the car park.) The car parking was a small negative because after forking out for staying in the hotel for 7 nights, one has to pay $7.50 to park per night. This was not encouraging but we didnt want it to ruin our stay. The service was excellent for the most part. The staff are courteous and thorough in their approach. Things were done with no questions asked. We particularly enjoyed the cordless phone in the hotel room with the 'consider it done' button. When we entered the room we were happy to have been given a balcony room in the Key West section of the resort. This was wonderfully to our taste with great authentic décor and dark mahogany wooden wardrobe and kingsize bed. The bathroom was very spaceous with nice twin sinks set into marble. Likewise the shower was very open and powerful. An in room fridge was standard and was ideal for milk beverages ; ) We had many early starts because we were visiting different parts of Florida. It was ideal because it allowed us to have cereal for breakfast. This was a much cheaper, faster and healthier option than the expensive (albeit extensive) breakfast buffet on offer at villa de flora. The view out of the balcony was interesting with the lagoon below filled with baby alligators and the peaceful sound of running water. At this point, it may be useful to say that it is quite noisy. It is noisiest at night during the weekend when they have fun light shows and live skating entertainment. During the week it was pretty quiet but the background noise of waterfalls etc may annoy some. The facilities are quite incredible. There are two huge outdoor pools. One of them is ideal for kids complete with a giant concrete squid waterslid. Tanning opportunities are plentiful at the adult pool with many great sun loungers and service for drinks. There was some construction going on around the adult pool and only two of the 4 giant jacuzzis were in action because of this. It didn’t bother us because we did get a good price and the construction was hidden well from view with scenic barriers. Perhaps the best feature of all was the 24 hour pool access. This made it possible to share a romantic night in the jacuzzi. Also on offer were 5 outdoor gazebo style buildings. They were complimentary if you want peace or privacy whilst at the pool. For those wanting to stay in shape during a visit was a small but barely used gym with 6 runners and 6 'sliding' machines. There was also stability balls and a mediocre selection of free weights. Classes were availble but we were disappointed that they charged a modest $7 per class. At that price they should be complimentary. Dining facilities are simply great. Highly recommended was villa de flora a buffet restaurant with all you can eat for $25. The quality of the food was high and the beauty of the restaurant was the cuisine from different countries on different nights. The italian was excellent - really really good. Brilliant salads, tomatoes, roasted peppers, cheeses, breads and desserts. There is a carvery with prime rib and ham for those on the atkins. The deserts were AMAZING. All you can eat Ben and Jerry's is always good, but add heatth bars and you are laughing! Stay away from the brownies but enjoy all the other 20+ varieties of desserts freshly made there! Sunset Sams was based on a 60ft ship inside the atrium and boasted a fair selection of seafood. We never ate their so can’t give a review. As for the the steakhouse, it looked excellent but I think it would be a more special evening if you weren’t staying at the hotel. We opted for Del Frisco's for our extravagant night and were impressed by the awesome steaks. One word about Gaylord hotels is the price of food. With the exception of the Villa De Flora, it is expensive to eat there, they have you where they want you because there are no restaurants within walking distance. This was a big negative for us the fact that the only transport is car. We rented for a few days and looked up osceola taxi cab company for a few other meals outside the hotel. Overall an interesting and exciting destination not only for business but for couples and those wanting time out in a great location at a cool hotel.

<Title>“Surpassed Expectations!”
<Content>enjoyed the stay at the gaylord palms. conveniently located to the disney resorts and not too far from the orange county convention center. complimentary shuttles to the theme parks. themed resort grounds are nicely landscaped -- love the gators. rooms clean and pleasant. only complaint was paying ~$8 to self-park per day. not only that but you had to drive all the way around the resort and past its convention center to exit the parking lot each time. i would definitely stay there again!

<Title>“Very Nice Resort”
<Content>We stayed at this resort from July 23rd 2005 through July 27th. I put in a price of $99.00/night for a resort near Disney area and ended up with Gaylord Palms and Resort. They were going to give me a florida room, but I mentioned reading a review that someone else that used priceline got an atrium view (on all other sites those rooms ran for $219/night). The desk clerk was very nice and said if I did not mind waiting they would give me one. We said we would and looked around the resort. At 3:00 pm we checked to see how much longer. I had requested Key West area because it was closest to the kids pool. They said it would be ready in half an hour. It was not so they gave us St. Augustine area. The St. Augustine rooms near the St. Augustine B elevator are actually right next to the Key West area which is where they put us. Since they did not have Key West area they took off the $10/night resort fee (I asked if they could take off self parking and instead they took off the more expensive charge). The whole time we were there the staff was really friendly and helpful. My daughter was sick one day so I left a note asking for the linen to be changed on the beds to make sure they would not just make up the beds. They changed them and did turn down service. I also called Old Hickory and asked if I could order soup for my daughter and pick it up. They said they ususally don't, but said they would since she was not feeling well and suggested a type that would be better to settle her stomach. We always had nice big fresh towels and they always replaced the soap, shampoo and lotion even if we had not used all of the rest. The phone did not work the first day and the fan made a clicking noise. Maintenance was there within 5 to 10 minutes of my call and fixed the problems right away. The kids pool was great for my grandaughter. I accidentally left three shirts in the closet with the iron. Lost and Found said they would ship them anyway I preferred to save me money. The only negative things are self parking which is $7 plus tax a night. I saw some people use the Valet parking which is $15/night, and they got people their cars quickly and you could drive right up to the lobby. For self parking they are doing construction so we had to park near the Everglades area. Once we got used to the routine it was a nice little walk to our room. Also you can hear noise from the Florida Festival in your room if you get an Atrium View, but we were usually at the events so it did not bother us. It was quiet the rest of the time and we had a nice view. If you want a quiet room ask for a Florida room which does not have the balcony. It is really pretty inside the hotel with flowers, plants and water falls. My grandaughter loved the alligators and seeing them be fed chicken. The acrobats show on the weekend was great too. The hotel is very close to International Drive which has lots of restaurants and the resort is only a few miles from Disney. If you use priceline and take your chances on a resort, you'll be lucky to get this hotel. It was definately worth the price we paid.

<Title>“Great Stay at the Gaylord”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at this hotel - booked through hotwire (gave us the greatest deal) - for 7 days. I think it's a great hotel to stay at. I have to give a compliment to the housekeepers - they straightened our bed and they made it sure that we have all the supplies (soap, towels, water, etc...) - twice a day! This happens everyday...not just by chance. We will leave to go the theme parks in the morning and then we will come back during lunch - and our bed is made - then we will leave again to continue our theme park experience at Walt Disney - and when we come back in the evening - our room is sooooo clean -- this I think is the best asset of this hotel. Of course there's the Atrium - makes you think that you are outside. It's very beautiful....I don't recommend eating at their restaurants there though - if you are a budget traveler like I do. They have restaurants close to them ...such as the American Sizzler - buffet for only $8.99 dinner - breakfast is $3.99 -- its a great deal compare to the hotel's $30.00 buffet. By the way, if you like lobster - we found an all-you can eat lobster close to this hotel - it's called Angel's All You Can Eat Lobster and Prime Ribs and Steaks for only $27.00 dinner - cheaper if you eat earlier than 6:00 P.M. Also, they offered spa services but I wouldn't recommend it - again if you are a budget traveler as there are cheaper ones just outside the htoel. My husband and I had a massage at Massage Wellness Center at Kissimmee - and it was wonderful - we only paid $65 - it will cost you $110 at the hotel for the same 60 minutes massage. We tried in-room dining -- it's a great experience - I recommed doing it at least one time. You have to pay extra 3% for service charge - and there's another charge I can't remember. Don't order the pizza - it's like those pizza you buy in a box then popped in the microwave. I do like the buffalo wings - it's a great appetizer. If you arrive late at night and don't feel like eating out - just get an in-room service. They serve fast. Like everyone is saying, the only drawback to this hotel is that they don't include the resort fee to your booking. It's $10.00 a day (water, fitness area, pool area use, etc). If you rent a car - you have to pay for the parking -- again I don't see the point. If other resort can afford their guest to park for free - why not a luxury hotel like them can't do it? Any how, valet parking is $14.00/day (pretty pricey if you are going to do it everyday). I ended up paying an extra $200 at the end of my 7 day vacation - including 1 movie and 1 in-room dining (medium pizza, buffalo wings, and 1 more appetizer I can't remember). This hotel is in great location - especially if you're there for Walt Disney World resort. They provide complimentary shuttle to the theme parks. They do not provide service to Downtown Disney, Typhoon Lagoon, or Blizzard Beach. I noticed that if you are there for the theme park, it's better to probably stay at their resort. I'm thinking of booking the Swan next time we visit - it looks nice from the highway. Overall experience at this hote is excellent!

<Title>“A Mini Theme Park”
<Content>This is a beautiful, huge resort with it's own theme park atmosphere. There are three "lands", Key West (complete with it's own full size sailing ship in water) St Augustine (Florida's oldest city-with a miniature fort and Spanish theme) and The Everglades (with real little alligators in a pond and fog machine blowing everywhere) The room decor complements whichever "land" you have chosen to stay in. Very courteous staff. We did not eat here, but many restaurants are on I192, very close by. (not walking distance) There is a large family pool, and also a pool for adults. The family pool had many children wading into the pool, which was set up like a beach, complete with sand. The only teensy-weensy complaint I had(and it's just personal preference) was that the bed was too soft. This place is not cheap, but it's worth it. Skip an extra theme park day and stay here.

<Title>“Nice place, but horrible staff...”
<Content>I live in Central FL but stayed at Gaylord for a 3 day convention. I used to visit the resort just to walk around the atrium. But now that it costs $7-10 to park, I won't visit for the hell of it! Upon arrival to the resort, I decided to self park since I had stuff to unload for the convention. Since there is construction, I had to drive thru the employee parking. Apparently an employee who was getting off work was frustrated with my lack of knowledge of the parking maze. When he almost hit me while trying to pass me in the parking lot, he showed me not one, but both of his welcoming middle fingers! I notified management and they offered me free valet parking for the rest of my stay. That sounds nice but it really wasn't. It takes the valets at least 15 mins to retrieve your car. It was more convenient to self park near the section I stayed in. I was part of the set up and tear down of the convention. You would think the staff would go out of their way to help a group of 350 during an off travel time...but they didn't. I could write volumes on how bad the staff treated us. Also, the food was extremely over priced. The dinner buffet which was good, was not worth $30++. I recommend staying and eating on Disney property. If you're looking for a nice place to stay...stay here. If you're looking for convenience and helpfulness...DON'T

<Title>“Great atrium, average rooms & service”
<Content>Huge atrium with restaurants, shops and nature (alligators). Service was mediocre. Waited 45min for crib (late night check in), rude housekeeping, terrible restaurant service. Marginal concierge. This place was designed for large conventions and they do not sem to cater to guests on a very personal level. Not a great place for kids either. Rooms were clean but very average with the exception of a computer in each room (nice touch). That being said it is still a very nice place to stay for a conference. As with many Orlando hotels, you will need a car if you want to venture beyond hotel.

<Title>“Best of florida Festival”
<Content>This review is a little late in coming but I just wanted to rave about the Gaylord Palms. From the fabulous entrance and lobby to the cool atrium to the very nice rooms, everything was great. We got a great deal for the Best of Florida Festival in the hotel atrium, and while the festival is not enough to make a trip for, we enjoyed it. The pool area was spacious, areas for kids and adults. The internet access with computer in the room is a great feature. Also, they had a special reception to kick of the Best Of Florida festival. When I asked the host for a drink ( I meant water) they brought my husband and me two lovely frozen drinks and sodas for the kids. Looking forward to revisiting for ICE.

<Title>“Gaylord Palms is full of luxury”
<Content>My sister is recently divorced, so this past summer I took her on a three day vacation to Florida. We decided to stay at the Gaylord Palms because some family in the area told us that it was the must luxurious. Boy, were they right! We spent most of the three days enjoying their spa. We had massages, facials, body wraps, and we even took some personal training in yoga. Our last night there we ate at Sunset Sam’s which was everything one would expect from a seafood restaurant in Florida. Overall it was a fantastic hotel and one that I will definitely stay at again in the future.

<Title>“Excellent - And Beautiful”
<Content>My week long hotel stay was perfect in just about everyway. People would probably ask why I would say so or what would give me justification to give a good review. Well in short, I refuse to travel anywhere, business or personal unless I'm provided a luxury rental car and a 4 star or better hotel and this hotel ranks as one of the best I have stayed in. When we checked in our first night after some flight delays and arriving at 12:30 PM we were initially greeted by the great valet parking staff who immediately opened my partner and my doors and expeditiously retrieved our luggage from the trunk of our convertible. Upon walking into the lobby, I was amazed. The hotel is beauitful and walking into the lobby is like walking into a different world. Upon reaching the check-in we were immediately assisted and checked in promptly. Upon reaching our room we were shocked to find out they had inadvertently given us a double room instead of a king room. I decided to walk back down to the front desk and get everything reassigned. Upon arriving at the front desk I was once again amazed, without question they apologized and upgraded us to a room in the Emerald Bay section which provides nice ammenties and larger rooms. This was without question or complaint. The rest of the hotel stay was phenominal, everything from the courteous pool side staff serving endless drinks and ease of use to charge everything to your room (poolside and in the restaurants and stores), to the business center that had a bell hop pick up some of the many snow globes we purchased from Disney from our room to be shipped back to NY. I have nothing but great things to say, I know some people are shocked by the cost to park or the charge for the hotel ammenties, but if you consistantly stay at nice hotels, you'll come to realize this is par for the course.

<Content>The hotel was super nice, the service excellent. The food is overpriced, but most resort locations are. It was not a cheap place to stay, but I think you get what you pay for. I had a room that opened up with a balcony that overlooked the atrium. It was very nice. The in-room computer was also very good and convenient. If you can afford the price, I would definitely recommend staying here. The bath amenities were great as was the front desk. I have been here at a convention before and it is great for them. You can stay, shop, eat, drink, swim, go to the Spa, which is wonderful and never leave the property.

<Title>“Wonderful resort! Expensive food!”
<Content>We stayed here April 7-11, 2005 for a conference (company-paid) and really enjoyed our stay. The different themes they had in the atrium were fantastic! Staff was excellent! Enjoyed the 2 bottles of water daily, since the tap water tasted like chlorine. The high-speed internet in our room also came in handy for emails. However, food at this resort was insanely expensive. 2 small boxes of cereal @ the Java store cost $6. Too bad the resort is in the middle of knowhere, or else I would've walked outside the resort to find cheaper eats.

<Title>“Kitschy, but relaxing”
<Content>Stayed here for a conference March 27-31, 2005 and really have very mixed reviews. This is not a place I would personally stay for leisure travel, but it was perfect for a conference. If you are not enthralled by the artificial (e.g., the fake stone structures in the middle of the atrium), this is not the place for you. In fact, my first reaction to this kitschy, “Hollywood-set” look was quite negative. However, over the days, we found it to be a rather relaxing place for a conference, and we never left the place from our arrival on Sunday until our departure Thursday evening. Walking to & from the convention center every morning & evening through the gardens with the sound of the waterfalls was quite relaxing. We had a room in the St. Augustine building. While the room itself was quite nice, the cleanliness standards leave much to be desired. When we checked into our room on Sunday evening, we found hairpins, bobby pins, elastic hair bands and “large” pieces of dirt or residue (e.g., food) on the carpet. We asked housekeeping to please vacuum the carpet the next morning. When we checked out on Thursday, those items were still on the floor! The furniture never seemed to be dusted. The back half of the desk and nightstand were very dusty as were all the lamps and the top of the wooden bed frame. The carpet looked as though it is ready for a good shampooing. We ate in all three of the restaurants, and although we do not eat meat, our favorite restaurant was the Old Hickory Steakhouse. Other than a salad and an appetizer, there is no vegetarian food here, but there are several wonderful fish dishes. The highlight of our meals at the Old Hickory was the marvelous cheese course. The fish restaurant, Sunset Jack’s, was a more casual place with good seafood dishes and cute entertainment (mermaid woman, person on stilts making balloon art, magician, musicians). Again, apart from salad, there is nothing on the menu for vegetarians. The quality of the dishes at Sunset Jack’s varies with the chef on duty. One evening our food was so highly black-peppered that I could not eat it. Another time the food was hardly peppered at all. The only place for vegetarians is the Villa Flora, which serves only a Mediterranean-style buffet. It is a great place for big appetites; however, we found the quality of the food here to be less than adequate. (I should note that when we mentioned on Wednesday evening the poor quality of the food and the lower number of choices on the buffet than we saw on Sunday evening during a walk-through, the waitress said that for that week only, they lowered the price for the conference attendees and had limited their number of food items. Likewise, the breakfast buffet was limited for the week to exclude an omelet station). The coffee shop, Planet Java, had decent espresso, sandwiches and salads, but very dry and stale croissants! All in all, the service throughout the resort was excellent and the personnel were all very friendly. Yes, as they have you captured there, you can expect very high prices. In the convention center you could have a glass of iced tea or a 12-oz. soft drink for $2, but a 12-oz. Bottle of Dasani water was $4!! Luckily, you got two free bottles of water a day in your room. We really appreciated the flat-screen computer and free internet access.

Stayed with my wife and 15 mo. old daughter and couldn't have had a nicer experience. If you're used to the Super 8 and Macdonalds for dinner, don't stay here. But, if you want a first class hotel, near disney, with a world class spa and great food and service. Then the Gaylord Palms should be first on your list.

<Title>“Worst hotel I ever stayed at!!”
<Content>The hotel itself is huge and the atrium is pretty cool but the staff is awful!! We received a confirmation that said that we would have a non-smoking room on the atrium but when we got there they told us that they only had a smoking room not on the atrium available. We went to the room with my 80 year old mother and as soon as you opened the door the smell was overpowering. My mom couldn't even stay in the room for 30 seconds it was so bad (I am a smoker and I couldn't even stomach the smell of it). I called the desk and they told me that we were stuck with that room but if we left for an hour they would ionize the room (whatever that means) so we agreed to leave for an hour. When we came back it still reeked so I called the desk again and got the same story no other rooms available and I demanded to talk to a manager who called back several minutes later. He gave me the same story and by this time I was fuming and told him to find me another room he said he'd call back in a few minutes and when he did he still gave me the same story that they guaranteed me a room but I had to take what they gave me. I was ready to take the bed clothes off of the beds and bring them to a couch at the lobby front door as my mom was sitting in the hallway and was tired after walking around Disney all day and told him he better find me a room even if it was the presidential sweet and I hung up the phone. Finally after two hours of arguing he all of a sudden says that he has another room. Hooray we move to another room, not bad but it smells like fresh paint but we were okay with that. Woke up in the morning and the coffee maker doesn't work so we left a note on it to replace it, got back at 7:30 pm and coffee maker and note are still there so I call the desk and they bring one up but as they take the old one away the little bit of coffee that never was hot spills on the carpet so he said he would send someone up to clean it, okay no problem. It was almost midnight when we got a knock on the door by the cleaning lady to clean the floor. Never, never, never will I stay at this property again!!!!

<Title>“Liked it, but.........”
<Content>It's one of those hotels that makes you pay through the nose in terms of room and food because it is attached to a convention centre and it knows it has a captive audience and most of the guests are there on the corporate ticket and expenses. The hotel is so isolated it's quite scary - once you are there, you are there unless you have a car. I ate at all the resturants and the food is great, albeit expensive - the NY Strip was a particular favourite. Also, the "free" internet in the room was a good touch, as well as the 2 bottles of water and OJ - replenished daily. But, along with the "free" paper every day comes a $10 resort fee. Plus, having to pay to park is ridiculous.... The room was more than adequate, large bathroom, clean and the CD player / alarm clock was a good touch. The hotel is a spectacle just to look at - the atrium is incredible - the 60 foot boat where you can dine is great, the alligators and fish are a great touch - all in all Ienjoyed my stay, but felt ripped off. Good job I was one of the fortunate ones on the Corporate expense account.....!!

<Title>“Only the best...”
<Content>I couldn't help but to raise an eyebrow after reading the last review...comparing this hotel to a Super 8 Motel doesn't quite add up from my experiences. I've stayed at the Gaylord on business and for pleasure with my family, and while it isn't cheap, it is extremely reasonably priced in terms of quality. You get at least what you pay for, if not more. All of the rooms are well furnished with not only the standard hotel ammeneties (a TV, coffee maker, ironing board, etc) but also many additional and unique features, including ceiling fan, flatscreen computer, safe sized to accomodate and charge your laptop, fridge, extremely comfortable and oversized bed, marble topped sink and vanity area in the bathroom, seperate from the toilet and shower to increase functionality, unique Florida-themed artwork and furniture...and the list goes on. And that's not just the suites - that's every room. The $10 resort fee is more than fair, covering a daily newspaper, 2 bottles of water and OJ refilled daily, free high-speed internet access with in-room computers, use of the fitness center, and free transportation via shuttle to the Disney parks. My multiple experiences at this resort have repeatedly proved to me the consistancy and quality of a willing-to-accomodate staff. This entire property is beautiful, exciting, unique, and well worth the money for those looking for a high-end, one-of-a-kind, personal, romantic, or family getaway.

<Title>“Room type...”
<Content>Beware!!!!! We recently stayed stayed at the Gaylord Palms & when we arrived there was a hugh ReMax Realty convention going on. The room we were given - without our knowledge - turned out to be a handicapped room. It was a regular room that was nice except there was no closet - this room had a nitch with no doors and a clothes bar that was about 24 inches across & was very low to the ground. We had many things to hand including a gown & asked to be moved to a room with a regular closet. The front dest was rude & told us that that was all there was - they still did not let us know it was a handicapped room. The bath room had a shower and the ground was level - meaning there was no step up to keep the water from soaking the rest of the floor - which made it very slippery to walk on!! Finally late the next day we had a friend that knew someone at the hotel & they had us moved to a regular persons room. Also the nite we arrived - the ReMax people had taken over the WHOLE hotel & you could not eat or go anywhere in the hotel except the outside pool bar for dinner - however we did not come 2000 miles to have a hotdog!!. There were guards posted all over the hotel keeping us out of any of the restaurants - finally we were told we could take a shuttle the hotel would provide to restaurants. We picked a good one - Moonfish - it was really crowed but had great food but very expensive!

<Title>“You will go broke unless you are a millionare....”
<Content>My wife and I just returned from the Gaylord Palms. My wife was at the Gaylord for business and I tagged along and worked from Florida. At first glance I was very impressed with the resort but then we checked in. We learned that they charge $10 plus tax for a resort fee. I guess the resort needs some extra dollars instead of putting the fee in the room rate. Then we were told that we were required to cough up an extra $50 per night to cover any room charges while we are there but would receive it back if we did not use the money. I will say the front desk staff was very friendly though. The room we got was just OK but not worth $190 per night since it did not look any better then a Super 8 motel room. We did eat at some of the restuarants and the service was the worst at the pool area. We waited 20 minutes before a waitress came around and asked us what we wanted to drink and order. We both ordered fish and chips and got 4 stips of fish and a lot of french fries for $12. Most of the food there was around $12 and the beer was $4.50 while the margaritas was $8.50. The sea food place on the ship was good. I ordered Sammon and got a very nice piece but nothing else came with it for $24. My wife ordered Scallops and got 5 pieces with nothing else for $24. Needless to say the resort over charges to the extreme. The bottom line is you need to be very wealthy to stay at the Gaylord Palms. We did not see very many families but the convention area was always full. I would recommend you stay some where else and eat off property. There is a lot of great places to eat and have fun. Enjoy your stay in Orlando but not at the Gaylord Palms.

<Title>“Good Experience”
<Content>This resort is a cross between a Las Vegas hotel and the Mall of America. It is huge inside. I just finished a 5-day stay and came to appreciate the large atrium when it rained outside. We were on business and there was no reason to even go outside. It's that large. Rooms: I had an Everglades theme room. It was large, comfortable and clean. The Internet access is on a flat panel display using a regular Internet Explorer browser. Just be aware that it isn't a regular computer. You can get online but don't expect a USB port or CD burner. There was an ethernet cable for anyone with a laptop. One nice touch is that the safe has a power line inside. The bathroom had two sinks and the usual assortment of bath soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. My only gripe is that there is no shelving space. I traveled alone this time but if I were with my girlfriend were would be having some real estate issues. Service at the Gaylord was excellent. Everything was clean and employees smiled. One night I ate at the Hickory Steakhouse and I do recommend it. You have to book in advance. Last night I had a quick meal at the indoor/outdoor bar. The burger was good but not cheap. $12 is a bit much. A 20 oz bottle of Coke costs $2 at the gift shop. Standard resort overpricing. Like someone else said, the $10 resort fee does give you a bottle of water. I was there on business but did have a free afternoon. The Gaylord has a free shuttle to Disney. The entrance is about a mile down the road. The shuttle is fine but you have to pay attention to the schedule. Also it stops at all the parks so I had to wait through two stops before arriving at Epcot. It takes about an hour for the bus to make a complete loop. Last but not least is the Canyon Ranch spa. It is expensive but worth it. They also have a small but very nice gym.

<Content>We are a family of four; two children ages 10 & 12. We visited the Gaylord in December 04 and we were very pleased with the resort. It is quite large and completely enclosed so that you can shop, eat or just watch the beautiful fish in the ponds, orchids, etc. The pool was wonderful with a neat slide and waterfalls, kids loved it. It was not very crowded while we were there. The food was good and the entertainment was great. I visited the Canyon Ranch Spa and had a glorious treatment. Overall, we were very pleased with our stay and would return. Definitely recommended.

<Title>“You get better service at the airport......”
<Content>I don't usualy do this but my families stay for New Years eve weekend at this resort was so bad that it would have been wrong of me not to complain. This place calls itself a resort but its complete lack of guest relations should rank it as a motel. From the moment we arived there were problems, our room not being ready even though it was past check in time, loosing dinner reservations and then making us wait to be seated. They even have a policy that if you dont cancel your own reservations they will charge your room for the complete meal. But when they lost our reservations they didnt offer anything to us and made us wait 20 minutes for a table. I could write for hours but really the only thing to do is not to go there. Its a beautiful resort with the warmth of the airport.

<Title>“Gaylord Palms just OK.”
<Content>Stayed at the Gaylord Palms Resort and just thought it was so-so. My 4yr old son and I met my husband there after the conference he attended there was over. We stayed two more nights so we could go to Disney World. The hotel is nice but if you are going for Disney World, stay at Disney World. The buses to the parks are only once an hour. The hotel is isolated and there is nothing within walking distance. The food at the hotel is good, but very expensive. We were charged $12 for a chicken strips and fries dinner for my son at the Villa De Flora restaurant. Ouch. A bowl of cereal at the Planet Java cafe is $3 and doesn't include the milk. Dbl ouch. The bottled water and OJ in the room was nice, and our room was quiet and lovely (Emerald Bay area) but not really kid friendly. And on our last morning my husband, who had been there for almost a week, requested a 2pm late check out so we could swim in the pool and have lunch, and the best they could do was a noon check out. They didn't seem very interested in accommodating us even though the hotel did not seem to be full. So we went and had lunch elsewhere. If you are a family traveling with kids, and in town to go to the Disney parks, pick somewhere else to stay.

<Title>“The Best!”
<Content>This was simply the best hotel I have ever stayed at! My husband and I stayed from 11/14 to 11/20 in an Emerald Bay room, directly above their piano bar, Auggie's. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and will return to the Gaylord Palms, if we every find ourselves in Orlando again. Although all 1400 rooms were booked while we were there it didn't seem crowded or busy. - Service/Staff: Every employee we encountered was friendly and courteous. While at the restaurants were weren't rushed to leave and in one instance encouraged to stay and chat. - Atruim: It's a sight to behold! We spent several nights exploring it. We also watched the alligator feeding, which was quite entertaining. It can get noisy due to the acoustics of the atrium but not loud. - Restaurants: The buffet is well worth $24 for dinner. The food was fresh and well prepared. Sunset Sam's had great food and drinks but was a bit pricey (ex. $13 for one crabcake) but not overly so. The 24 hour cafe is mediocre but convenient. - Resort Fee: We thought this was a great value, since we usually end up paying $10 for internet access at other hotels anyway. At GP the fee includes shuttle service, OJ and water. Also, the parking fee is to be expected as well, and the price consistent with other hotels in the area. - Rooms: Our room and bathroom were big. Ours may have been bigger than most because it was on a corner (looked like it was designed to be wheel-chair accessible). The bed was VERY comfortable. - Pools: We used the pools and hot tubs at night so we had them to ourselves, which I haven't witnessed anywhere else. Also, pools are open 24 hours a day, when they're isn't a private function. - Location: This resort is located in a prime location...very close to Disney Parks, Sea World, Old Town, shopping and restaurants. If you're looking for cheap eats there's dozens of chain restaurants nearby. I also found it very easy to get around the resort area. - Beware: My husband and his co-worker did have a strange experience with a woman selling (one-day only) jewelry in the convention area. Turns out she was selling high priced costume jewelry and representing it as precious metals/stones.

<Title>“Great resort, little faults.”
<Content>The resort was my first choice because of its proximity to disney. It probably took about 3 minutes to get to the entrance. Atrium was lovely and the view from the balcony was great. Our room was about 7 floors up in St. augustine and faced the large screen TV which was nice to look at, even though it didnt play more that music videos and some ads. The $10 resort fee and $8 parking did not seem worthwhile, considering that we made no use of the orange juice, water, or newspaper and the parking lot was quite a distance from the section of the hotel we stayed. Would have been better for the hotel to add the resort and parking fee to the general price so that I wouldnt have to think of its value and complain. Villa de flora restaurant was a good deal with its $25 dinner buffet, having a wide variety of food. Other restaurants seemed overprice. Decent sized room with computers-Internet was not working during my visit. There wasnt a big convention or a lot of visitors during our visit so grounds and pools were not crowded. Lots of amenities from gym to daycare for those that need it. Staff was helpful-have a lot of tiping money. Will definitely go back.

<Title>“A vacation all by itself”
<Content>We were here for a meeting. We loved the fun atmosphere of Gaylord Palms, with "foggy" Everglades, live alligators, jugglers and other surprises. Our room was well maintained, with a full computer for email, hotel services and Web surfing. Food was good; Steak House was packed, so reservations are in order there. We were pleased to have a pool for people over 18 only. Staff were courteous. The $10 resort fee was a real bargain, since it included use of the computer, water and orange juice, shuttle, and use of the spa fitness center; you would pay much more for those amenities in most hotels. The Canyon Ranch Spa was very relaxing. All in all, even though we are middle-aged and not great fans of theme parks, we would want to stay at Gaylord Palms again.

<Content>This is an excellent resort! A gigantic resort covered with a clear glass dome-like roof filled with natural scenery, waterfountains, and much more. The resort also has a digital resort-wide service system where you can order room service, buy convention tickets, order attraction tickets, check information, and much more. Room availability is also rarely a problem, the resort has over 1,000 rooms each with an indoor or outdoor view. The resort also holds many seasonal exhibits for all guests and visitors, including the "ICE at Gaylord Palms" a winter exhibit featuring over 2 million pounds of spectacular ice sculptures including fun ice slides, beautifull winter scenes, and much more, warm parka's are provided in all sizes for all visitors to the exhibit. The Gaylord Palm's Resort is an excellent resort destination. I recommend this resort to all. You can find out more information on this resort at thier website

<Title>“Absolutely amazing!”
<Content>This hotel is absolutely spectacular! It is an inside paradise with waterfalls, alligators, turtles, and lush tropical landscaping. The atrium is something that you have to witness. The size of it is impressive! I have traveled the world for work, and this hotel ranks up there as one of the very best I have ever stayed at. We stayed on the second floor of the Saint Augustine section for an extra long weekend because of Hurricane Frances and I would stay here again in a hearbeat. Our room was beautifully appointed with a computer with free internet access, a b Flora Marketplace and Restaurant along with having some cocktails at Auggie's Piano Bar. All the food and drinks were absolutely wonderful. The service was top notch from everyone we encountered. Our server Matthew K. and bartender Roy at Sunset Sam's were attentive, knowledgeable, very friendly, and upbeat. Our cocktail waitress, Melissa C. at Auggie's was a delight. Now, for the people that say it is very expensive to eat and park, they are 100% correct. But, almost EVERY 4-5 star hotel will be just as expensive. I GUARANTEE IT. The maid service wasnt the best, as we had to call for them to bring toilet paper up (I was told they were very short staffed because of the hurricane). The shower curtain is rather bizarre. It is very flimsy and doesnt really cover the entire outline of the tub, so I was often nervous that I was going to flood the bathroom. You get what you pay for and this hotel is totally worth every penny. I would recommend this hotel to my business associates, colleagues, friends, and family ANYDAY and I would stay here again next time I am in Orlando.

<Title>“Fabulous hotel”
<Content>I was at the Gaylord during the July 4th holiday with my family. We were awestruck by the grandeur and very happy with the service. We have stayed at many hotels in Orlando including the Portofino, and I would recommend this hotel highly because it is self-contained, has many convieniences as well as a high level of service. Brand-name stores like Ben & Jerry's and Godiva are a great bonus when you have a late-night craving. The Disney store offered ticket sales, and even 1/2-day passes for the parks. Even with a convention, a martial arts tournament, and a wedding at the hotel during our stay, I found that the service was very good. We were always addressed by name and our needs were met in a timely manner. Though the food prices were expensive, particularly at the steak house, all our meals were very good. Even if you paid discounted convention or online rates for this upscale hotel, you have to expect to pay upscale restaurant prices for the meals. If you are looking for affordability, my recommendation is to take the shuttle (or drive) to Citywalk and get the Movie and Meal Deal for 19.95 which includes tax and gratuities. The only disappointment with Gaylord was that we initially booked an atrium view, but got a city-view instead. On the flip-side, we were allowed to check in three hours early and got a late check-out as well. I thought the resort fee of $10 was very reasonable, as my teenagers used the shuttle service to the parks on a few occasions, and they were able to stay connected with friends via the in-room laptops. My only reget is that I didn't have the opportunity to use the Canyon Ranch Spa services, but I will next time.

<Title>“AGREE WITH DO NOT STAY HERE!!”
<Content>I would not send my worst enemy to this hotel. I worked hard for 6 years to put myself through college at night. I wanted to stay at a beautiful hotel for my graduation.... NOT!! There were kids running in and out of the overpriced bars at all hours of the night. Kids screaming at 3 and 4 in the morning that echoed through the atriums to the point where you can not sleep. The help at the front desk were rude. We were not asked upon checkout how our stay was. Every single employee except for the waiter we were assigned at breakfast had an attitude and stood there and looked right by you like you did not exist. I was more informed by the other guests than the help themselves! By the way make sure you bring even more money for your overpriced stay for the parking fee that you are not notified of ahead of time. I have also visited international hotles that made this place a dive. SAVE YOUR MONEY STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!! IT IS A WAIST!!

<Title>“Beautiful Resort!”
<Content>The Gaylord Palms is a gorgeous hotel! I was a bit worried because it is not on Disney property but after our stay I think we made the right decision. We stayed in the St. Augustine section of the hotel. We had an atrium view room overlooking the Villa de Flora resteraunt. The atrium is a sight to behold! We never noticed it being too loud. We didn't have any problems with sound or loud noise coming from resteraunts as other reviews have stated. My one and only complaint would be the $10/day resort fee. This fee should be optional. It covers orange juice, water & shutlle service to the parks. Everyday we recieved orange for each person and water for each person and the shuttle service was awesome, but you should have a choice as to whether or not you want to use these amenties instead of automatically being charged for them. For those of you who are visiting Disney the shuttle runs every hour as of now. It could change in the future. No need to rent a car or pay for parking unless you are planning on doing something else besides the parks. It does run to Universal Studios and Sea World as well. Coming from Las Vegas where we have top of the line hotels and resorts everywhere, the Gaylord Palms is a top notch hotel!

<Title>“Magnificient!”
<Content>The first thing you think upon entering the 4 1/2 acre atrium is "you gotta see it - to believe it. The inside of the atrium looks like a themed section of Disney World- with Key West, St. Augustine, and the Everglades represented. Lush tropical plants, waterfalls, even a fort and a sailing ship! We booked on Priceline for $85 and were given an atrium view room- usually $219 a night on expedia. The Palms does charge a $10 a night resort fee - but- that includes a free in-room online service, workout facility, and 2 bottles of Dasani water and 2 bottles of Minute Maid orange juice every day of your stay (if you've ever had Orlando water- you'll appreciate this!) All in all - the best experience yet in an Orlando hotel- Disney included!

<Title>“Nice place, close to Disney”
<Content>The Gaylord is a very nice hotel. We were there on vacation to visit Disney World, which is very close by. The atrium is fabulous. I think we all know a great hotel when we are in it, and this is one of them. No problems with noise, staff, etc. as in other reviews. The kids pool is amazing. Great water slide. I understand that 99% of all who stay here are part of a convention, which may explain many of the high costs at the hotel to eat, incedentals, etc. All in all this hotel is agood value, we paid $80 each on price line for two rooms. Its obvious that the convention crowd subsidizes the luxuries this hotel offers for the regular folks that stay there. The $10 "resort fee" per day is an unfair charge as is the $14 per day valet parking. Parking is available for $7 per day (unfair to charge for parking) in the regular lots. Just make sure to park near your part of the hotel. They play games with your credit card, i.e. we used the valet for two days but were chraged for four on checkout. Random charges on my credit card from 'Gaylord Palms'. Make sure to deduct the $17 per day for the "resort fee" and parking from what you are willing to pay. We rented a car, and its a good thing we did as food in the hotel is priced unfairly for leisure travelers. lots of chain restaurants around the corner, at about 40% of the cost.

<Title>“Love the Gaylord!”
<Content>We stayed here from 4/7-4/11/04 for the COA dance competition. We have stayed here before so we knew what to expect. This hotel is absolutely gorgeous. It is a resort that is totally self-contained. The atrium is beautiful and the grounds are well taken care of. During this trip we were in the Key West section of the hotel, which judging by the decor, seems to be the older of the sections. The emerald tower is much nicer and if you have the choice definitely ask for an atrium view. It really makes a difference. Every room now has a computer with internet access which allows you to check on your emails and get info while you stay.We ate at the boat and the buffet and the food was very high quality with a nice choice of entrees. The boat is expensive, although the do have a childrens menu for about $7 a child. The buffet does not give a discount for children so beware, it can get pricey. The hotel charges 14.00 for valet a day and $7.00 for self-park. Once you have checked in I recommend self park. There are many exits from within the hotel to the parking areas and you wont have to wait for valet to get your car. If you are not going with a group or convention, you might want to call ahead to see if one is happening during your stay. With our dance/cheer convention there were about 3000 competitors. The staff worked so hard to keep everyone happy and really cater to the event . We will definitely be back for next year's event. It is a little on the expensive side, but you are staying at a 5 star resort.

<Title>“Agree completely with "do not stay here!"”
<Content>I could not agree more with the post "do not stay here!" I was anxious to try this hotel ever since watching it go up during previous trips to Disney.I planned for a weekend at Gaylord Palms to follow a fabulous Disney Cruise. What a horrible way to end such a great week!!! (The Cruise was incredible.)There was a BIG convention at the hotel when I was there. The adult pool was closed in the AM. There was not a chair, towel or sitting space to be found at the kids pool and no manager or help (besides waitress) to be found. Many, many guests were standing around infuriated. The fact that there were babies with dirty diapers in the pool and long human teenage trains careening down the slide on top of all of the small children was not noticed by any management because the only person that worked there was doing braids for girls!!!!The kids pool closed in the early afternoon for a convention event. It was 80 degrees and the kids had nowhere to swim at our very expensive hotel.When I asked if I could have (a slightly 1 hr) later check out, they basically said "NO! We're full for a convention!) and then when I asked if I could change my kids somewhere they said "if I paid at the Spa downstairs I could" and hung up! The prices for every drink or bite to eat are outrageous!I have stayed in the nicest hotels in the world and this place was an unbelievable ripoff.

<Title>“Best Ever”
<Content>I attended a conference at the Gaylord in early March. The service people were excellent. Everyone in all areas were helpful and accommadating at all times. The resort is beautiful and the skylight over the central court made for a bright exotic feeling. Having 2 pools, one for adults and one for children is an excellent idea for those wishing a little peace and quiet away from children. The food was excellent in every restraunt, though some were expensive the quality and presentation of the food made every penny spent worthwhile. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing a few days of luxury and a desire to be pampered. Great for children and adults. One of the few hotels I have stayed in where the staff were always pleasant, helpful and there to meet your every need. A must see if you go to Orlando.

<Title>“Theme Park-ish”
<Content>I booked this hotel last minute to join my sister for an improptu weekend getaway. I paid 30 dollars extra for the executive room, but the difference wasn't noticeable. We stayed just one night and I brought my four year old son, who thoroughly enjoyed the octopus waterslide, dining on the ship in old key west, and checking out the gators and snakes in the everglades section. We stayed over on a Saturday, and a lot of the interior sections were closed off that evening for private functions which limited our mobility somewhat. Overall, it was a pleasant experience in a very unique resort. One suggestion for improvement would have to be directed towards the slide at the Marine pool. There is no lifeguard on duty and children were "wild" using this pool and the rules and regulations regarding the slide were not enforced at all. I would suggest that at least a monitor be placed at the slide to avoid accidents.

<Title>“Nickel & Dime”
<Content>I agree with so many of the reviewers... the hotel is phenomenal and fun to walk through. However, I was getting sort of ticked about their resort fee not being dismissed when the internet service was down the entire visit (therefore, I wasn't able to surf the net as anticipated for research... my purpose for accompanying my husband on a business trip was to figure out a return family vacation). We didn't get our water & juice a couple days and when I requested it about 9pm, I had someone deliver it at 11PM (rang our doorbell!!!). The rooms were quite noisy... other doors were heard slamming & I could hear our neighbor snoring during the night. Food was expensive and entrees came without salad or soup. But it was a nice ambience and the "eye candy" exceeded my expectations. Staff were friendly and helpful. I just finished a review but forgot to tell you about the lukewarm water. I am all for scalding precautions but the water at Gaylord Palms does not even make your skin PINK. I love to lay in a warm tub & read a book. I never soaked for more than a couple minutes. Brrrrrrr.
