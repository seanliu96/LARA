<Title>“Great location”
<Content>Stayed several nights. Staff was helpful and friendly. Room was clean but the decor was a liitle dated. However they are renovating the rooms starting this Spring.They have updated the TVs since our prior visits to large flat screens. Room had a good view of the harbor and downtown toward the ballpark. It is in a great location so we didn't need a car.About a 15 to 20 minute walk to the Gaslamp and Petco. Same amount of time to walk to the ferry to Coronado and the Midway. We used cabs to get to the Zoo and Balboa Park. Our package included the full buffet for breakfast which was very good.We wouldn't have paid out of pocket for it every morning but would have been worh the splurge one time during the stay.

<Title>“Good location and hotel but not a 4 star hotel...”
<Content>I booked a grand club room at he Manchester. We were given first a king room with a very stuffy/smelly carpet and far from the club (level 22) where you have to o back to ground level, change lift and go back o level 32! After complaining on the smell, they easily changed us room but give us only a disable access one because they had nothing else...despite me reserving 5 months ! This room was fine anyway, so we stayed in this one. However we booked grand club and you have to know that the room is nothing special: just a standard room giving access to a club. Generally the club was "okay". We booked club following our experience at the hyatt grand cypress in Orlando... In San Diego the grand club standard was lower than in Orlando (no hot food served neither on breakfast nor evening). The soaps provided don't have a pleasant smell...so bring yours! The bed sheet didn't fit the king size bed, so we kept waking up on the mattress! Generally disappointing standard.

<Title>“Poor service”
<Content>We arrived quite tired around 9:00 in the evening from the east coast, and the front desk found our reservations, (We had booked two rooms.) They had not have the rooms we booked and woman at the desk had to look for rooms for us. I always find this amazing. I have never worked in the hotel industry, so I don't understand why if you have a reservation (And if you don't cancel, they will charge you!), but they don't have rooms set aside for you. The desk clerk did give us free wireless for our stay because check in took so long. In 2012 I will never give a hotel an excellent rating if they charge for wireless (even if I'm not paying for it). That's like asking if we want hot and cold running water. The clerk gave us a choice of rooms. Of course they did not have connecting rooms for our family. If you've booked two rooms under the same reservation, why would you not want the rooms to be near each other?! We took the rooms that were at least on the same floor. The first night was fine. The second night we discover our room was part of a VIP suite! The party was inches from us in the connecting room. As it did not proceed past 10:30, we did not call security. The next morning the breakfast reception in the connecting lounge area started at 5:45am! Yikes! Now we do call the front desk and security. Of course they can move us, but not until later in the day, but who wants to pack up all their things in the middle of their vacation, but we did it and they moved us. Now we're in a room where we have to take an elevator to the lobby and a different set to get to our son's room. Unacceptable, so they move us again. The front desk did comp buffet breakfasts for our party for the length of our stay. If only the woman who checked us in had explained about the VIP suite, I would have chosen the other offered room. Poor service. Oh, and I found trash in the middle of the floor of the second room. It had obviously not been vacuumed.

<Title>“Great Stay, Good location!”
<Content>Stay at the Manchester Grand Hyatt for one night on April 15th..Was my first stay in a Hyatt hotel, and I can't say that this hotel make me fall in love with the chain! At first, we were on the 27th floor with a GREAT view of downtown San Diego and the water not that far from there..Our room was really clean and we enjoy our view! As a corporate travel agent, I have a lot of client looking for hotel like this so I will suggest it without any problem!! We were happy that there was a self-parking, since a lot of hotel on this trip were valet only..and cost double the price this hotel is charging!! Great stay, ask for a high floor room if you want a really nice view..(or in the Harbor Tower) We had a great service by the staff at this hotel, even a little more when you are a travel agent and also a Gold Passeport member!! :)

<Title>“Great stay....again!”
<Content>Once again I stayed at this great hotel. The room itself was a bit dated, unlike my previous stay. What makes this place great is the staff. From check in, house keeping, restaurant staff to operators, everyone is very professional and went out of their way to make the stay wonderful. I had just stayed here last month for business and went back for a mini vacation. I will be returning again soon. My only complaint once again is the lack of free wi-fi. They should have areas of the hotel where you can get free wi-fi to check emails, etc...

<Title>“Bad price/quality ratio.”
<Content>Stayed two days in March for a corporate event. The room was OK but didn't reflect the price they charge, the halls could use a revamp as well as the carpeting on the room itself. Be careful with the tempting water bottle they leave by the big screen LCD TV, it has a nice paper tag that says "Refreshing" and you may miss the $5 price tag written in a considerably smaller type below it. On the other hand the front desk people were the most helpful i've ever seen, the halls and the lobby architecture is quite impressive. The hotel is at walking distance of Gaslamp District and USS Midway. I recommend visiting the bar at the 40th just for the awesome city views that its windows give you, be warned that drinks up there can be quite expensive...

<Title>“Much to expensive for what you get”
<Content>One could argue that the place had it's best time, but I think it is not even that old... But my subject says it all: way to expensive compared to the service you get in return. Towards the food: only interesting if you adore the American way. As a European I was not in for a treat...

<Title>“Nice but expensive”
<Content>This is a very nice hotel, but for the price, I would expect half and half in the room with my coffee-maker (Non-dairy creamer isn't drinkable) and complementary bottled water. Just seems sort of cheap on their part to charge $5 for a bottle of water when the room is already expensive. The room service is also just over the top in price. My bath tub had a slow drain so I ended up standing in water when I showered. The spa was a highlight, though. Had a great massage. The location is also terrific.

<Title>“Great location, amazing gym.”
<Content>If you like to work out when you travel, this gym will NOT dissapoint. The restaurants onsite are ok, but pricy. There are tons of little shops and restaurants just outside the back door if you want to get out and enjoy the weather. Sally's makes some of the most mind-blowing sushi I've ever experienced.

<Title>“Lovely hotel”
<Content>Stayed 6 nights while my husband was at a nearby conference. Really enjoyed it. We were on the 14th floor of the Harbor Tower overlooking the pool, views were amazing. The freight trains were noisy but it would only be for a few minutes once or twice in the night and then I'd fall asleep again. I'm sure it would be the same from all the nearby hotels. It was a standard hotel room, perhaps a little tired but the rest of the hotel made up for it. The whole experience was a positive one.

<Title>“Ruined our trip to San Diego”
<Content>We had planned on staying in San Diego for three nights and called a few places and decided that the Hyatt seemed like a good deal. We were told it was going to be $179 for each night, but we informed them that we needed something with a kitchen. They said they had something with a kitchen for $200 so we immediately decided this was a great deal and booked it. We got to the hotel late in the evening with a toddler and an infant. We valet parked the car and had the bell desk take our luggage. When my husband went to check us in, he was told that the room was actually $179 plus $200 for the kitchen. We were disappointed, but since it was late we decided to stay anyways. When we got to the room it was horrible! The room was so outdated and the kitchen was nothing more than an old refrigerator, a small sink, and some old cabinets. There were no dishes, utensils, or dish soap. Then we went into the bedroom and looked around. It seemed okay until we saw the bathroom. They had put us in a wheelchair accessible room, which meant that there was no tub in the bathroom. It also meant that safety features, such as locks, were now accessible to my toddler. We wanted to leave so badly, but since it was so late and the kids were so tired we decided to stay for at least one night. The next morning we checked out and told the person at the front desk about our experience. He was very apologetic and tried very hard to remedy the situation. He offered us a different room, but ultimately we decided to look elsewhere. We were told that they would be remodeling the hotel this week, but in my opinion they should not have let anyone stay there. I felt like it was a last ditch effort to get some money before the remodel. The experience at this hotel ruined our time in San Diego. Instead of sightseeing the next morning, we were busy looking for another hotel and waiting for their check in time. Needless to say, I will not be staying at this hotel again and I will think twice before staying at a Hyatt hotel. The one good thing about the hotel was the breakfast. It was a buffet and our server was really great.

<Title>“Very nice on all counts”
<Content>Great location, rooms are nice (no balcony which was a bummer) beautiful view, options for dining, good pool and nice staff. The only down part was that the room walls are pretty thin so sleep could be an issue. Especially if it's over a weekend with lots of people coming back from the Gaslamp late!! The amenities of this Hilton make it worth coming back to again and again. I got a great rate on hotels.com but I woudnt pay for luxury here (stay at the Del or the W for that). This is a great all around hotel if you can get a good price. And the fire pits are really cool :)

<Title>“Great stay at the Hyatt”
<Content>Loved the hotel & room. I was worried after reading some reviews that the rooms would be old - but to my family's delight they were spotless & very nice. I had a corner room which was the perfect size for a family with 2 teens. Perfect location in the middle of everything- only drawback would be the noisy trains, however, they don't pass every night. My kids LOVED this hotel!

<Title>“Nice place for business or vacation”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel for work with a family member to make a vacation out of work. Nice walking distance to Gas lamp, trolley and seaport village. Concierge was helpful and went out of his way to book us a rental car for a trip up the coast. Disappointed with the access to the pool, fire pits and hot tub. Tried to gain access every night for 5 nights. Large groups were at the fire pits preventing additional access to other guests. Limited number of hot tubs for size of hotel as well. There were not many activities in the area to do in the evening after dinner and seaport village closed which made the hot tub and fire pit situation frustrating. The rooms were small but adequate if you aren't spending a lot of time in it. Our bathroom was older and needed some TLC but again for the location not a problem in my book.

<Title>“Aesthetically nice, but very poor management and staff”
<Content>From arrival to departure I experienced some problems with the front desk. It seemed as if most of those behind the desk were in training, as they had no idea what they were doing. My check in took 1/2 hour as they did not know how to add my credit card to the bill (my roommate had already checked in). Moreover, the keys were not programed correctly which remained an issue every day that I stayed there : I had to go to the main desk and have them reprogram the key every morning and one evening (I did not have the key next to a magnet or cell phone). The check out is still a disaster as they divided the bill between me and my roommate, charging her for her half yet I have been charged the entire bill. It has been 4 days since my departure and there still is no resolution. I call the hotel and they aver that they will fix it and send my a copy of my bill via e-mail. This has yet to occur. Regarding the physical/aesthetic state of the hotel, the reception area is large and extravagent, but the rooms are simply average. We had the suite, which was very spacious, but the bathrooms were dated and I was surprised that there were no fans, whereby I had to keep the door open when showering. The amenities ranged from good to terrible: the gym is very nice, the meeting rooms are suitable, the saunas were broken, and the restaurants were average, at best (very high prices). The location of the hotel is wonderful and the view is gorgeous, but there are other hotels on the same strip that may have better service and more updates. I did not have a good experience at this hotel from start to finish and am unable to recommend it.

<Title>“So Impressed!”
<Content>We used to stay at this hotel and stopped because the service had become fair at best. We gave it a 2nd try recently after a few years of not staying there, and EVERYTHING was fantastic! The front desk clerk was overly accommodating, the room service was on time, food was very good, and the attendants were professional, the bellman was over-the-top friendly and took extra time and care to assure us our bags would be safe while being stored; on checkout day, an e-mail was sent to us with a barcode in it that allowed us to quickly check out by scanning it at a kiosk...it was so easy! No waiting in line for the front desk, just to check out! We will definitely stay there again. Someone has done a terrific job instilling "customer service" in the staff and it shows in every interaction. In addition, our suite was clean, ready, and beautiful!

<Title>“Great location and great staff.”
<Content>Just returned from a 5 night stay over spring break with my wife and 7 year old daughter. First off the hotel is in a great location near downtown and the is bayfront with access to all the great areas nearby. You can easily walk to the Midway and ferry access to Coronado. We loved Seaport Village out the back door. It has something for everyone and is a great place to people watch, shop, or grab some food. As for the hotel, the lobby is great and makes a nice first impression. Every staff member we dealt with was very helpful and friendly. The breakfast buffett was excellent but if it hadn't been included in our room rate I'm not sure we would have spent the money to eat there. It was over $50 a day for 2 adults and a child, but as I said it was excellent. It is expensive to eat almost anywhere in downtown S.D. so factor that into your stay. I would have given 5 stars if the rooms would have had 2 queens instead of doubles, but the beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. Maid service was a little slow a couple days, but we were there over Easter, so that may have had something to do with it. The water pressure in the shower was the best I have ever experienced anywhere. Hopefully when the upcoming remodel is done, they will get rid of the double beds and bring in some queens. I think the fact that they have alot of business travelers probably accounts for the doubles but it is not ideal for families. Even with the bed situation, hopefully fixed soon, I would return. We loved the location and nearby activities, and the friendly staff. As for the noise mentioned by other reviewers, it's downtown and all the other hotels have the same problem I'm sure.

What a great location & facility on the water & within easy walking distance of downtown San Diego & the gaslamp district. We were equally impressed with the staff and service at the Grand Hyatt. Downtown San Diego has lots to offer with shops and a multitude of restaurants. We also felt very safe walking everywhere and how clean and new everyting seemed. Enjoy San Diego some day!

<Title>“Good business stay”
<Content>I joined my husband here for a conference, and it was a very nice property. Nothing overly spectacular but the service was solid, and the breakfast buffet at Lael's was quite nice and had very good service. Super-close to Seaport Village and right across from Kansas City Barbeque (even though it's touristy, it's been really good every time we go), and taxis are always readily availble and not expensive. Only took 10-15 minutes from the airport, so it's very convenient. A 10-minute walk to the convention center, and it's not the closest to it, but it's San Diego -- enjoy the walk. I'd recommend the Hyatt.

<Content>Pricelined a couple of nights here so didn't pay top dollar and we enjoyed it very much, great location. Wandered into town in the day for shopping and back to the Gaslight district in the evening for dinner. Enjoyed Seaport village another evening. The hotel itself was beautiful very grand. Our room was on the 9th floor overlooking the pool and the bridge to Coronado. It had everything we needed except the internet, that was an additional fee. We also went up the the lounge on the 40th floor and enjoyed a spectatular sunset and view of the city and surrounding area. I thought it was very elegant and enjoyed all the coming and goings in the lobby. I have no complaints, location good, beds comfortable and staff friendly.

<Content>we had a wonderful time in San Diego due to the convenient location of this excellent hotel. The room was lovely with views over downtown SD and the yacht marina, the rate was a special one. Friendly staff, state-of-the-art gym, elegant outdoor pool and jacuzzi with views across the bay. But beware, prices in the hotel owned pubs and restaurants are high. So you easily spend on food and drinks what you may have saved on the room.

Rooms are large with two small double beds, extra huge tv, coffee maker and the usual you get with this level of hotel. Only down side if your not a great sleeper is the railway runs by the hotel and the trains horn can be heard every half hour or so, even from the higher floors.

<Title>“Not up to par”
<Content>Management had recently changed and hotel shops had closed. Although the hotel was decent (housekeeping was a bit off) it was not up to Hyatts standards particularly in 75% of the property's restaurants. In the three in house restaurants food choice was very limited and was standard hotel quality. The hotel did have an outstanding evening and weekend venue called 'Sally's' that I would highly recommend. We had significant issues with locating equipment we had delivered to the hotel. Management is planning a renovation & has indicated it would take our concerns into account.

<Title>“Great location!”
<Content>This hotel has an amazing location, it's right next to Seaport Village Shopping and Restaurants and a short walk to the convention center, USS Midway, the Gas Lamp Quarter, a trolly station, and Petco park. It's also about a $13 taxi ride to the zoo and museums in Balboa park as well as to the airport. The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. I cannot imagine a hotel with better harbor views than this. Be sure to go to the Top of the Hyatt bar on the 40th floor in the daytime and night, it's absolutely breathtaking. The staff at the front desk went above and beyond to help us, even sending bandaids to our room when my friend cut her finger. My one room complaint is that as we were flipping through the travel magazines in the room, my friend and I came across what appeared to be marijuana stuck on the cover of on of the magazines. But I know that not every nook and cranny can be checked after every visitor. It was just unexpected. Another is how confusing the hotel was. If you are only staying there for the room then you should have no problem but we were there for a conference and had to go from tower to tower. There are plenty of maps so that was nice but it was something that we never really figured out. Also there are 2 sets of elevators, 1 is for floors from the lobby to about the 24th floor and the other is from the 25th to the top, the second blasts past the first 24 floors, so make sure you get on the correct elevator. Also beware that you will here the trolley a bit, the coast guard flies out a lot of helicopters in the area, and the airport is not that far away either (obviously none of these can be helped but it's nice to know). Over all it is a great hotel in a great location.

<Title>“Big hotel, but never felt overwhelmed”
<Content>The Manchester Grand is one of those hotels that attendees to conventions in San Diego often find themselves. It was a nice hotel, with clean rooms that are even a bit stylish, good beds, well-functioning internet service and a convenient location. The hotel is made of two large towers, and however I did not feel overwhelmed by the hotel. It has a majestic lobby, and the rooms and hallways, while not as gorgeously appointed are nevertheless pleasing. I did not have an opportunity to use the pool, but it looked fantastic. My one complaint would be the rather limited selection of restaurants within the hotel, although immediately outside toward the water are several other restaurants.

<Title>“Great stay”
<Content>One of the nicests Hyatts I have been to. Clean, lots of services. Decent bar. It's a meeting hotel, lots of conventions this year in SD, but very nice place. Walk out the back door and You are at all of the shops.

<Title>“Great location and views”
<Content>This is an excellent place to stay for first timers to San Diego. The view of the bay is perfect and it is walking distance to the Gaslamp district and the sea view village for good food / nightlife options. The access to the trail along the water is also perfect for walks or runs. The train nearby is convenient for getting around the city, but the noise that travels up to the hotel is a bit troublesome at night. This may vary depending on where your room is. Lastly, the pool is gorgeous, but it is extremely windy in the pool area - more than when you leave the hotel, which makes swimming a bit challenging because of the chilly air. The concierge and front desk staff are very helpful.

<Title>“Solid stay”
<Content>My son and I were at the Hyatt for a convention and some sightseeing. The rooms are "older" and nothing special. We were on a lower floor but still had a view of the harbor. The outdoor pool was heated, but still somewhat cold. My son enjoyed the basketball court and the shuffleboard outside on the roof. This was definitely a bonus for him! The other nice part is the harbor village behind the Hyatt. We ate in several of the restaurants and were able to do some shopping. The other nice perk was the on-site Hertz rental counter. I had reserved a car and we were able to take an easy day trip to Legoland. The Hyatt is also convenient to the ball park and down town restaurants. Overall it was a nice stay. Again, the hotel and rooms were nothing special and the price was not a great value, even with the convention rate, but the location is quite nice.

<Title>“Nice for business travel”
<Content>Very functional place for going to a meeting - there are enough amenities and close by restaurants and shops so that you can take a quick break from time to time. The health club has well maintained machines and the restaurants and room service are good. Great shower pressure and loads of hot water in the bathroom, as well. My only issue was with housekeeping - if you're in when they stop by, they don't come back. Instead, they leave a card saying, basically, "sorry, you missed your chance." (It actually says something like "we respected your request for privacy so call us if you want your room cleaned). I did that but unfortunately it was to no avail. Small issue, I probably could have been more persistent, but I was busy. The shops in the lobby were mostly closed due to renovation (the whole hotel is undergoing one soon, according to the front desk).

<Title>“Another good Hyatt experience for the most part.......”
<Content>I have stayed in a lot of Hyatt properties and this was the third time at this hotel over the past two years. I like this hotel and its location near the waterfront. The rooms are fine and the lounge on the 40th floor has wonderful views of San Diego and the bay. This time were in an upgraded petite suite on the 27th floor with a great view of the bay. This room had to be around 750+ square feet with two bathrooms and two large flat screen TV's. It also had four telephones - like we need those in the era of smart phones. Good bed and it was on a building corner so it was very quiet. The buffet restaurant was included in our room package and it has a very good selection for breakfast. Staff was great from the front desk to the valets. BUT..... I was over charged for an additional night of valet parking and both morning buffets, which is $24 each. These charges did not show up when I did the video check out when we left and I assumed everything was fine until I got home and checked my credit card bill. I called the hotel the next day and a very nice employee provided excellent customer service and go the bill credited to bring it in line. A little frustrating, but nothing that would prevent me from returning in the future.

<Title>“Grand Lobby, Average Room”
<Content>The shiny marble lobby and pictures are huge and impressive. But was disappointed upon entering the room. The carpet was dingy, the room still smelled of strong air freshener (surprisingly, the windows can be opened), the bathroom faucet handles were chipped. The room needed updating. Every night, I had trouble with my key card and had to swipe it at least six or more times before the door would click open. Another guest passing by told me he had the same trouble with his door. The Samsung HDTV (maybe 42" or 46") was huge for the room. The beds were comfortable. The room was quiet. The view of the harbor was good. Our group enjoyed the use the firepits by the pool. We liked the location because we could walk to the Gaslamp District, Seaport Village, marina, and downtown. The bar at the top of the Hyatt has a great view.

<Content>We recently stayed here for a few days and would definitely return. The room decor was a little tired but it was obvious they were slowly making upgrades. The room was also clean. We can't say enough about the staff. Everyone we had the pleasure of coming into contact with was friendly and helpful. The location is ideal; on the bay but walking distance to the Gaslamp District.

<Title>“Really exceeded expectations! Fabulous location”
<Content>I booked this last minute, and have been so pleased with the hotel! The location is great for singles, but also families- it is close to Seaside Village. The staff is extremely pleasant, and the bar on the 40th floor is lovely with fabulous views. One little gripe, for such a nice hotel- no shower caps in the bathroom. I know this is a trend, but it is so annoying when you have to wait 15 minutes in the morning for someone to get you a shower cap? Why don't they just leave them in the bathrooms like they used to? Were so many people stealing them? But I digress, on the whole, a very nice hotel!

<Title>“Trendy”
<Content>We stayed here 4th of July weekend 2010. Nice upscale hotel. Great staff. Loved the pool area with the fire pits and movies by the pool. Great view of the bay and Navy ship They offered make your own S'mores and snacks buy and to eat while watching a movie in the pool Gaslamp district was a big meat market! Lots of teenagers and college kids. We took a pedi-cab from the hotel. Beware of price per person. Being a holiday weekend, the restaurants were full and it was hard to find something without reservations. There was a dance club outside a Friday's restaurant with girls in bikini's trying to get people to go in. Too much for the kids to see! Otherwise, it was a great get away

<Title>“If they fixed their reservation system, I'd be a regular.”
<Content>I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times on business, most recently in Feb/March 2012. Although I think the public areas are a little overdone and dark, I like the hotel overall. It is in a great location making it easy to walk to sights along the waterfront and in the gaslamp district. I also give high marks to the staff who are super-friendly and make a real effort to remember you day to day. The hotel also has a somewhat expensive but phenominally good breakfast buffet with daily specials in addition to the regular selection. The onsite restaurant, Sally's, is also exceptionally good. I didn't use the pool area but someone I was traveling with enjoyed it very much and told me there is an outdoor firepit there. My one complaint is the reservation system. This year and last, I called to receive a conference rate and was told there were none available (even though others who called after me did receive it) so I reserved at a standard (discount) rate. Before I boarded my flight to CA, I used their online system to check in to the hotel since I'd be arriving late in the evening. I received an email confirming my check in: "your room is ready." But when I arrived tired and ready to relax, I was instead told that I had been checked out of my room and there was no availability for me that night. Instead they put me up in another hotel that was nearly 30 minutes away. Granted, it was the historic Del Coronado which was very nice and they provided taxi vouchers in both directions, but I honestly just wanted to get settled in the place I was intending to stay for the duration. The next day, I was essentially left homeless until the afternoon when they could finally accommodate me. Yes, they were apologetic but I was definitely not happy. After that, I am pleased to report that my stay was entirely pleasant.

<Title>“Pretty good and pretty pricey”
<Content>We usually stay at l'Aurberge in Del Mar or the Grand Colonial in La Jolla when we visit the great city of San Diego. However, my daughter had a medical conference at the convention center so we decided to stay at the Manchester Hyatt just a long block away. The location is great if you want to be close to the downtown attractions and Coronado. Very 'urban'. $26 a day if you park yourself. $35 (I think) a day for valet parking. The room was expensive but the view was great. 1 L water $5. TV Movie $14. Internet access extra. Everything extra. So unless you are craving a city like setting or need to be downtown, check out Del Mar or La Jolla or Coronado accommodations. The beach park at Del Mar with adjacent Jake's and Poseidon restaurants is the greatest. If you decide on La Jolla, make sure you are in the village of La Jolla and stay at the the Grand Colonial or La Valencia. On a budget? The Great Western is just fine. Best breakfast or dinner in La Jolla at a decent price The Cottage that is walkable from the village.

<Title>“Stay here, eat elsewhere.”
<Content>I enjoyed my recent stay at the Manchester Grand Hyatt. My room in the Harbor Tower was spacious and clean. Everything was in working order (iron, tv, hot shower, a/c & heat). The wireless internet was fast and consistent for me - think I lost the connection once in my 5-night stay. Bed was comfy. I had a nice view of both the city and the harbor. Cons: The hair dryer was a mini travel one - wish I had brought my full size. Cobb salad from room service was pretty awful, and buffet breakfasts were overpriced (but that is expected at any large, corporate hotel). Tub faucet was coming away from the wall - I didn't complain, because it didn't affect me at all; but I'd expect better from a Grand Hyatt. It is a HUGE hotel with two towers. I came and went without anyone even noticing, there were no hellos from the doormen, etc. - but this is fine with me. Any staff I did encounter were incredibly kind and helpful. In terms of location, it is a 7-10 minute walk down West Harbor Dr. to the Convention Center, and a 10 minute walk up Market St. to Horton Plaza and all the restaurants around that area. Little Italy was a 15 minute walk up Kettner. The hotel sits directly on the harbor, where there is a great walkway for running, biking, walking, etc. Very flat and pretty views. I would definitely recommend eating away from the hotel. Go to the bar on the 40th floor for a spectacular view of the area, but then walk over to 4th or 5th or up to Little Italy for more afforable, more creative food. Also - be forewarned that there are freight trains that barrel through downtown, blaring their horns at all hours (usually between 3-6 a.m.). This is hard to avoid no matter where you stay if you are along W/E Harbor Drive, but maybe ask the front desk if you could have a harbor-facing room to help dull the sound!

<Title>“Top notch hotel experience”
<Content>I attended an international conference held at the hotel over 4 days in March. Room was excellent (although the shower was more like a high pressure hose) with a nice view of the harbour, staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the hotel was luxuriously appointed and location was excellent. - just a few minutes walk from restaurants/bars and sights. Breakfasts were of reasonable quality and prices not too bad for a hotel of this stature. There were several restaurants and bars in the hotel which provided good food and service for a reasonable price.Overall I had a very positive experience and would recommend it highly.

<Title>“not as expected”
<Content>I stayed here for a conference. While very close to the conference center, and close to the waterfront, I was disappointed in the state of my room (hair in the bathtub on my arrival, drain in the tub was clogged, broken chair), especially given the very high price. And the internet was hit-and-miss, which was very annoying. Although the staff were friendly, when I checked out they did not ask about my stay at all. Next time I'll stay further away from the conference centre as San Diego is very walkable.

<Content>Great views. Great staff. The cleaning of the rooms does not appear to be a priority (after 3 one day and after 4 on another). Be prepared to answer the same question three times to the female parking cashier, she does not appear to be in a hurry. Relatively close to convention center and situated directly next to seaport village. Workout facilities was spacious with plenty of equipnent. Too cool to use the outdoor pool, but i am not sure that i want to swim in the same pool that two ducks have taken up residence.

<Title>“Excellent Staff”
<Content>Recently attended a company sales conference at the Hyatt. The service is excellent, from the bellman and the front desk to waitstaff and housekeeping, all were professional, helpful and friendly. In this day of little to no service this was a pleasant surprise. They should be very proud of their people. Small unexpected things were even taken care of, I finished my travel mouthwash and tossed the container before the end of my trip-no big deal. The next morning there was a travel replacement set next to the sink for me. That little attention to detail was there throughout-I am impressed. My room was a smaller double but being by myself that was OK. Our rooms were assigned by event staff so I can't complain. The room was very clean, wifi worked great, refridgerator in room made it easy to go to Ralph's (local grocery) and stock up with things for a week stay. The bathroom is quite large by hotel standards with extra storage space. Overall very comfortable. The view from the 30th floor,Seaport Tower was excellent. Even though my room faced the other tower to the southwest you could see the Pacific and Coronado and to the southeast downtown and the mountains. Hotel is an easy walk to shopping, dining, museums, the USS Midway. Overall great location.

<Title>“Nothing short of remarkable”
<Content>I stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt in December 2011. I stayed over the Christmas weekend, and I didn't know what to expect around this busy time. This really wasn't a problem, as my stay was wonderful! I booked the hotel at the last minute to visit my brother over Christmas. I flew into Long Beach Airport and drove down to San Diego. I was pleasantly surprised when my standard double room was upgraded to a larger corner room on the 18th floor. The room was amazing, with a great view of the city and of the bay, and the windows even open a little bit. I did, however, make sure to keep the windows closed at night because there are train tracks a short distance away from the hotel, and I didn't want to hear the trains at night. My room was very clean and comfortable. The lobby is incredible. It's very stately and it was nicely decorated for the holidays, including a gingerbread replica of the hotel made by local elementary school students. There are several things to do, including an outdoor swimming pool on the fourth floor and tennis/basketball courts above the parking garage. It was so nice to sit by the pool and take in the beautiful San Diego skyline in the perfect 75 degree weather. The location of the hotel is ideal. Even though we rented a car, it was nice being able to walk to most places and not have to pay for parking anywhere. Seaport Village is right behind the hotel, and I highly recommend the Harbor House restaurant right in Seaport Village, if you're looking for some great seafood or steak. The hotel is also a short walk away from the Gaslamp Quarter with a plethora of restaurants and shops. Two of the mornings while I was there, we went to eat breakfast at the Broken Yolk Cafe, right in the Gaslamp Quarter, and I absolutely loved it and can't wait to someday go back! Horton Plaza is an outdoor mall close to the hotel, which is worth going to. I had a great time while there, and I have absolutely no complaints. I highly recommend the Manchester Grand Hyatt to anyone wanting to stay in an ideal location central to the many attractions San Diego offers!

I really enjoyed staying here and I have hard time to find something wrong. The gym is also really good and well equipped, the position is incredibly central, the breakfast is huge and really good, the service perfect and nice.

<Title>“Great staff and hospitality”
<Content>This is my first review, so bear with me, but I am a longtime traveller under all sorts of conditions: hostelling, camping, B&Bs, all inclusives, luxury and plain Jane hotels. I stayed several days at this hotel for a conference. What stands out most about this hotel is the staff. I have never been treated so courteously and felt so welcomed by hotel staff at all levels as here: desk clerks, bell hops, bar staff, and maids. I do not think the rooms are particularly special, but they are pleasant enough and well maintained. Full breakfast buffet was $25; cereal bar $17, as I recall. The buffet was very nice, but I think too pricey especially if you are not going to pigout at a buffet. I would like to have had the option of ordering a small breakfast from a menu (not available), but wait staff was very amenable and let me know omelets from the buffet were $8 and each side or beverage thereafter was $4, so I was able to have a nice breakfast for $12. There is a pickup sandwich/breakfast shop. Also just outside the hotel on the marina are many restaurants a short walk away. The h'ordeurves and dinner catered by the hotel for the conference were very good, especially the h'ordeurves. The location of the hotel was also very convenient to shops, the Gaslamp district, the convention center, and the aircraft carrier museum. Concierge was extremely helpful during my stay. What did I miss? There was no complimentary hotel shuttle to and from the airport, which seemed odd to me. Also not much convenient public transportation to the museums and zoo that I could see. So overall a very good experience and an outstanding experience with hotel staff.

<Title>“Booked through Hotwire and treated like an equal.”
<Content>My boyfriend and I always book through Hotwire and thought we might be treated differently at this high class hotel because of it. We were pleasantly surprised. We traveled about 7 hours to get to this hotel and we ended up arriving an hour before check in. This was no problem, we were given a room right away. We were in awe when we opened the door to the hotel. Not only did the front desk give us a room early, but they also gave us a corner room. Very large, three windows with incredible views, nice sized bathroom and a very comfortable bed. My boyfriend and I were never treated any differently, not even when we walked into the hotel with a bad full of food from home. Great hotel! Only disadvantage is the pay to park garage, but that's to be expected in a big city hotel.

<Title>“Fantastic Location But...”
<Content>I recently spent a couple of nights at this hotel as part of a conference. As noted in my title, the location is fantastic, within walking distance of many nice sites, restaurants, etc. However, considering the cost of the room, you'd think the rooms would be nicer. I understand the hotel was built in 1992, and the rooms look like they have not been updated since then (with the exception of the enormous LCD TV). Don't get me wrong , their was nothing wrong with the hotel or the room, but it fell short of a typical Hyatt property and could never be considered a value.

<Title>“Great Hotel in an Excellent Location”
<Content>I have now stayed here several times on business and find this hotel to be a great hotel to stay at for many good reasons. The hotel restaurants are great especially Sally's for outdoor dinning. The roof top bar also offers spectacular views of San Diego and the bay.The pool and hot tub are located on the 4th floor overlooking the bay area and the Coronado bridge. The hotel is closest hotel to Seaport Village for shopping and more restaurants. The hotel is also within easy walking distance to some of the best downtown restaurants on or near Gaslamp on 5th street. Refer to my San Diego restaurant reviews for some great restaurant reviews. This is a classic hotel. As an alternate I would recommend the Hilton half mile south also on the bay. I will be back!

Although the hotel is only about a block away (the Mariott is between the Hyatt and the Convention Center) this particular conference was in the hotel itself. It is a massive property comprised of two towers with a 4 story conference/meeting/activities center joining the two towers. The pool area on the the roof of the 3rd story (4th floor access) was lovely, but the temperatures were a little cool for my taste, so I never actually got in the pool. It's handy because the workout facility is also on the 4th floor (Seaport Tower) adjacent to the pool. Although I typically request a King room, settling for a double-room this time allowed me to check in at 11:00 am versus 4:00 pm. It was a very nice corner room on the 25th floor( 2585) offered views of the both the bay and the City. There was quite a bit of open floor space despite the two beds and a couch. In fact, it was more than enough to allow for my floor exercises and stretches. All of the furnishings appears to be in either "like new or new" condition, including the carpeting, and the TV was a mammoth 50 or 52" flat panel. I also had an in-room frig where I stored my waters, sodas, yogurt and fruit...yay! I also appreciated the full-sized blow dryer in the bathroom -- versus the typical, wimpy, attached-to-the-wall version. You also get tubes of Aquafresh toothpaste along with the typical shampoo, conditioner, and lotion ammenities. Nice touch. I also L-O-V-E-D that the windows opened to allow fresh air, although I was quickly reminded that all of the hotels in this area are also adjacent to the train tracks and there are very noisy freight trains that go through the intersections blowing their air horns in the wee hours of the morning. Be sure to bring your earplugs or close the windows before turning in for the night! The hotel is also immediately adjacent to Seaport Village, which provides lots of opportunity for dining and shopping. They don't currently have a "convenience/sundry" shop in the hotel. There is a sign indicating that new retail shops are "coming soon," but they were selling some sundry-type items (water, soda, snacks, personal needs items) in the little breakfast/lunch shop in the base of the Seaport Tower next to Redfield's Sports Bar. BEWARE: I drank the two sodas I bought from a CVS Pharmacy in the Gas Lamp District and had to pay $3.25 for a Diet Coke from this very same sundry area. Everything was very clean and well maintained. You can pick up a free wi-fi signal IN the meeting rooms, but otherwise, have to pay to use the hotel's wireless and wired Internet ($12+ per day). Be sure to check out the Sky Bar on the 40th floor of the Harbor Tower. The views were truly spectacular and allowed us to truly see just how much taller the Hyatt is versus the Marriott towers next door.

<Title>“High prices for the height of great views”
<Content>It's a big, chain, convention hotel. Great and friendly service from the staff. Stunning views from the high floors. Stunning prices (high!). It's just not worth it for a night's sleep. I would stay there again only if I could get a deep discount. Otherwise there is plenty of competition with equal or nearly equal views nearby. As for the convention space: they use narrow chairs locked together forcing meeting attendees to be packed in to the rooms like sardines. Uncomfortable. Cramped. I would expect better of Hyatt.

<Title>“Too many things wrong with this place (Diamond Member)”
<Content>The Grand Hyatt website tells you that (for this category of their hotel portfolio) you should "expect nothing less than spectacular" This is laughable - the Manchester Grand Hyatt is tired, cavernous and unsophisticated. The view from my room was stunning. But the furnishings and fittings were old and depressing. My club level room lacked some basic amenities befitting a hotel of this standard (robe, shower cap, complimentary water). The club lounge was small, and quite sad. The food options were basic. Not a place you would want to hang around in. The wired internet was extremely slow - I had to sit on the floor by the door to get any signal from the wireless internet. Housekeeping failed to refresh my coffee on two of the four days I was there. They also forgot to clean my room one of the days. I called them at 4pm to ask them to come while I was at the gym (I even stopped by the front desk to double check sure it would be done quickly. I returned to my room at 6 pm to find them just getting started. I had numerous problems with my room key. I had to make the long trip to the lobby three times during the course of my stay. The whole leisure area is similarly sad and tired. Feels almost institutional. The gym was spacious and well equipped but in desperate need of a face-lift. The decor in the room appears to date back to the 1980s. As one staffer told me...Mr Manchester "never spent a dime on the place" when he owned it. It's apparently under new management now and they will be renovating in April this year (three floors at a time) The location is excellent but I wished I stayed at the Hilton Bay Front (where my conference was). This was trendy, fresh, bright and contemporary. I felt sad having to leave it everyday to go back to what seemed like "grandmas house"

<Title>“Great location, average hotel”
<Content>This hotel has a great location near the harbor and can walk or catch the trolley to do many things. Great view and room was nice. Ballrooms are tired looking. Was there for a convention and the service from the staff was marginal. Always had to ask multiple times to get something done, and then it was still not done quite the way we asked for. There was a water leak one day and they had to shut down the water to one entire tower from 8 am to 8 pm in order to fix it. Many people had to go without a shower or use of their toilet. Only service recovery offered was to use the shower in the spa (there are not that many, so imagine the line and the lack of towels) and only offered a refund or partial refund to those who asked for one at the front desk. Also, all the shops inside were closing down when we were there (Jan. 2012) so they didn't have much for sundries at the hotel. We found out that this hotel had just been sold and was under new management, so this transition may be the reason for the service issues. If you are looking for a nice bed in a nice location, this is a good pick. If you are there for business, be prepared for an extra wait. Oh, and check out at the front desk and review your bill carefully. I've stayed here twice and had billing issues to clear up each time (first time was charges from the previous room occupant on my bill, second time was convention billing issue).

<Title>“Picked It Up a Notch”
<Content>I've stayed in this fine establishment a total of five times. The location is superb. Right on the Harbor and within a few minutes walk from great restaurants and shopping. Apparently, the hotel came under new management last year and the customer service has really improved. While the rooms are still in neeed of updating (scheduled for this year), the service was top drawer. Every staff member I encountered went out of their way to make me feel welcome. I had a Corner King room with a fabulous view of the San Diego Harbor and downtown San Diego. Planning another trip to San Diego soon and the Manchester Grand Hyatt will be my hotel of choice.

<Title>“Amazing venue with a fabulous location”
<Content>We were here for a convention, and I was concerned that this hotel would be located too far from the convention hall. While it is a walk, it's so worth it. The Hotel is very grand... the lobby soars and is reminicent of the old train strations back in their hey day. The ceilings have to be 60 feet... truly impressive. Check in was fast. The lady who checked us in was named Kelly and was super friendly and very helpful. In fact, we found that ALL of the staff was very well trained, professional and went out of their way to help their guests. The hotel had an observation deck on the 40th floor (my ears popped in the elevator), and a wonderful outdoor area with a pool and fire pits on the 4th floor. Our room had a great view and was very comfortable. We ate in the hotel one day, but while the buffet had a ton of options, it was spendy. However, immediately behind the hotel is the Seaport Village filled with restaurants and many fun shops. I would hope to stay at this hotel again the next time we return to San Diego.

<Title>“San Diego convention”
<Content>The room isnt fancy, but clean and comfortable. Nice to be able to open the window for fresh air. Comfy bed and pillows. Fairly quiet heat/air conditioning. Never heard any neighbors - so good much appreciated quiet nights. Pretty good lighting in the bathroom for putting on make up. Bath shows a bit of wear, but very clean. Good water pressure in the shower, always hot. Nice to have a fridge without mini bar nonsense. Full length mirror is appreciated. The staff were all friendly and helpful, especially concierge staff. Had a room on the 26th floor with an outstanding view over the Bay. Gorgeous. Hotel is good location to the Convention Center and activities on the board walk. Seaport Village right outside the door.

<Title>“A Newer "Grand Dame" on the Bay Front”
<Content>This is an absolutely beautiful hotel with very attentive staff. I was here during a conference being held at the Convention Center next door. A full service hotel, with several restuarants, coffee and gift shops, etc. I really enjoyed the parking as it was easy and I beleive a city parking deck which was connected to the building--which meant fees were very reasonable and not the usual major profit center hotels usually leverage parking to be. Views are spectacular. The location is absolutely perfect, right off the Gas Lamp district and right next to the Convention Center, as well as on the Bay Front. This is a totally first class affair that just about anyone should be pleased with.

<Title>“Disabled friendly”
<Content>Having just spent 3 nights at the Manchester Hyatt with a group of injured and wheelchair bound british servicemen who had been competing in military para-olympic trials, I can thoughly recommend the hotel. We were a group of 15, all with differing needs and the hotel could not do enough for us. The Disabled Rooms were what was required, with walk in showers and everything else required. The hotel although next to the conference area of the city catered for the traveller as well and was only a 10 min sedate walk from the gas lamp area of the City. A special thank you to the front desk staff especially Tina, who played a "blinder" in sorting all our needs out.

The room & closet were FULLY wheelchair accessible, even the window drapes had an electric push button open/close. Roll-in shower and a built in shower chair. Plenty of room in Lael’s restaurant and Sally’s Seafood restaurant for maneuvering

<Title>“I've had better”
<Content>My stay here wasnt bad, it just didn't live up to my perception of a Hyatt. The hotel is in desperate need of a renovation. Rooms: excellent Samsung TV and awesome water pressure. Those are the only positives I found. My linen was not clean (top), the bathroom (other than the shower pressure and the toothpaste) was a huge disappointment. We didn't even get a standard number of towels each day. The decor was severly outdated, especially the desk chair. And I think the worst part was there were no working outlets EXCEPT the bathroom. Really? Not one outlet on a lamp, the desk ones didn't work, nothing. Having to pull away furniture or crawl under a desk is just unacceptable now a days. Service I found inconsistent. Tina, who checked us in was very nice. Carlos who opened up a set of restrooms for my party to use late night by the fire pits was so great. The person (who works in banquets because "he definitely isn't a concierge" in the regency club was a destructive conversation to just listen to. I should not know that it's cheaper to not serve hot offerings in the off season, that you don't have a concierge working upstairs because it's cheaper to bring them on part time in the spring, and that you just work in banquets and dont care for management. All that from me sitting at one of the computers to print my boarding pass? I'm sure the guests he was speaking to were just as appalled as I was. This was in the evening on Sunday. The server in there on Friday was wonderful. Upon checking out, I attempted to store my bags at the bellstand and Arciello (I think) was curt and condescending. I actually went back to get my bags because he was so rude and I didn't feel comfortable after that. The Doormen are EXCELLENT and very knowledgable. So, to sum it up, while some parts were very nice and the location I'd great, the rooms need some TLC and updating. Some employees are amazing and others are just flat out terrible. I will choose a different hotel when I return to SD.

<Title>“Nice but expensive”
<Content>Spent four nights and five days at this hotel in mid-February. The room was nice, but not anything beyond expectations and not great compared to price. The food in the restaurants and for room service was excellent, but also very expensive--about $30 for breakfast for example. Ordered room service which showed to be less than $20 for menu price, but after taxes, delivery charge and gratuity was almost $30, too. Was there to attend a meeting and the meeting rooms were excellent, plenty of size and layout was good plus the sound systems when needed were excellent. No problem hearing anything said. The location is also very nice, but really didn't to go anywhere much. Went to the Gas Lamp District for first night's dinner and found that the prices for food there were pretty high, too. All the food we ate while there was excellent in taste and preparation, but very pricey, too. Nothing was a bargain. Had a chance to tour the Air and Space Museum and found that to be a lot more interesting than expected plus they have a 3D/4D movie presentation that you should definitely see and experience. Seats move with 3D motion and makes you feel like actually flying or riding on a roller coaster! Most incredible viewing experience I've ever had. All in all a very nice stay, but not one I will likely do again due to the cost.

<Title>“Very nice upscale hotel.”
<Content>The hotel was what you would expect from a Grand Hyatt. The service was great except for the concierge's dinner recommendation. The rooms were typical hotel rooms, nice but not special. The meeting rooms were large and well done. The food provided for the meetings was actually pretty good. Dinner in the Gas Lamp district is a five minute walk. If you are a runner don't miss the FRONT steps at the convention center. Go out the front of the hotel and go right a half mile. There is a board walk by the marina at the back of the hotel that has food and shops.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>Me and my wife join my daughter for a one day stay at this hotel. Stay was both a business stay and family trip. Check-in was fast. Room was excellent with a view of the harbor. Hotel room was above average and room service was fast with great food. I must note staff was very frendly and helpful.Hotel location is outstanding since was near the Seaport Village with its gift shops and restaurants. It also provided access to the boardwalk and a ten minute walk to the USS Midway Museum. Land transportation such as the trolley is across the street. I may mention you may hear as passing train which may effect you if you are a light sleeper so request a room so you do not hear the train going by. Future vacations plans will include a longer stay at this hotel.

<Title>“It's Grand in size with good service in good location!”
<Content>I had a chance to stay one night on business with a co worker before we moved on to Park Hyatt in Washington D.C. The main reason I chose to stay here was great pricing and good reviews I read in Tripadvisor. As we drove up to the hotel we were wowed by the size of the hotel and lobby was huge. Our check in was very smooth and we were upgraded to Premium View at no charge. Our room was decent size with very comfortable beds. I guess best part about staying at thie hotel was the view of San Diego harbor and our room had a view of aircraft carrier. Our internet was complimentary but we did not try any of the hotel establishment due to our busy schedule. Overall I can not say anything nice but this hotel and will most likely stay here again if I am ever in san Diego again. I loved the location and view of San Diego harbor.

<Content>Stayed in room 1703 from 02/20/12 - 02/24/12. There are stains on the carpet, florescent light in the bathroom buzzes, the water pressure is so high that the showerhead hurts and the toilet is very loud when it refills. The channel selection is very pour but the tv is a nice size and has a good picture on the few hd channels they have. The bed doesnt have a fitted sheet and continiously comes off. The room has not been updated since the 80's and it shows. During our confrence in their ballrooms they would put away the lunch and drinks 15-30 minutes early. If i had a choice i would stay at the sheraton marina. It cheaper, has a shuttle to the airport, the rooms are very modern and clean, they have balconies, and the staff is very nice.

<Title>“Good location, nice hotel”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel for one night while attending a conference at the Convention Center. The Hyatt is just a few minutes walk from the convention center and close to lots of bars and restaurants in the Gas Lamp area. I stayed here because I got an extremely good rate by naming my own price on Priceline. Check-in was quick and easy. The room was nice. Had two queen size bed (would have preferred one king bed as a solo traveler, but it was fine), small sitting area, and a desk. The bathroom was clean and updated. There was an updated television and the beds were very comfortable. The view from my room was nice... overlooking the harbor. The staff were very helpful with check-in, giving directions, and suggesting places to dine at. My only complaint was that at 7am I got a repeated knock on my door claiming to be a wake up call, which I had not requested. When I did not answer the door right away, the woman came into the room to wake me up. This seemed odd and was definitely not appreciated as I had not even requested a wake up call. The other negative thing about the hotel was the cost of parking. I think it is probably comparative to parking in this area, but still seemed steep. It was $27.00/day. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I were attending a convention and could get a good rate on the rooms again. I would also stay here is I were vacationing in San Diego since it is close to many attractions and a trolley station.

<Title>“Fabulous experience”
<Content>Everything about our stay exceeded our expectations. We had an upgraded room with a view of the bay. The hotel is convenient to a great number of attractions, too. We were there on the husband's business in December during a "cold snap" when the temperatures were in the mid-sixties, so we didn't make use of the pool, but thought it was gorgeous. Our room was spotless, the wi-fi worked well, the bathroom was a very nice size, the king bed was comfortable, and the towels and linens were in excellent condition. Our biggest compliment goes to the concierge for her restaurant recommendations. On one occasion we took a taxi to a restaurant, but once we got there we realized we could easily have walked. The valets were all very friendly and helpful with directions. Not surprisingly, the rooftop restaurant was a bit pricey and the food was not that special, but the cocktails were yummy and we enjoyed watching the sunset the lovely atmosphere of the lounge.

<Title>“Location and View are what make this hotel”
<Content>Stayed at the Hyatt for a convention and I must say the views and the location are great. Our room however could use a lot of improvement! It definitely needed updates. The sink and floor in the bathroom had very large cracks. The cleaning staff were very lacking in their duties. Our bed was made and sometimes shampoos etc replenished but that was about it. The counters where we laid our coffee stirs were not wiped down even one time. The room was not dusted or vacuumed during our stay. In my opinion, for the price we paid for our room ($359 per night) it should have been immaculate!

<Title>“Too Big To Be Great”
<Content>Beautiful property with lovely view of the bay. Two huge towers and easy to get turned around. Food was average at best. Drinks were outrageously expensive. Rooms were good size with easy chair and desk, but drawer space was very limited. My wife used the drawers and I had to live out of a suitcase. Supposedly five star, but I found things efficient, but impersonal. Had two incidents at the hotel and had to hunt down a manager to complain to. He apoligized but that was the only action the hotel took. (Attending a large international conference, so I was just one of many.) BUT, I would stay there again.

<Title>“Great...I think.”
<Content>Let me start by saying that this hotel is absolutely beautiful. There is not a bad view in the place, and the rooftop pool is great. However I did have a few bad experiences while staying here last september. First off, the fact that there is no free wifi in rooms in this day and age is ridiculous. The rates are high enough where that should be offered without question. Upon arrival we were given key cards that well, really didn't work. I am a pretty patient guy, and was there on vacation so I tried to make it work, but these key cards really just didnt work. We were issued new cards once, and then twice, and then after coming back to the hotel late they didn't work again. Went back down to the front office, and they sent somebody up to "fix" the door lock. The next morning it still didnt work. Talked to management and they moved our room and waived the steep $25 dollar a day parking fee. Inconvenienced yes, but they made it right. In the middle of our trip I checked my bank balance, and the hotel had sent through two random charges to my card for $96 and $154. It wasn't the room costs or a deposit, and I ,had ordered no room service etc. No one could tell me why the charges were there. Thankfully an employee at the front desk named Vincent made it right. He seemed to care, and he spent a good amount of time talking to the billing department and even called my bank to get the charges reversed. If it wasn't for his customer service this would be a one star review because I was upset at this point. Front desk guy Vincent and Front end Manager Chris should get commended for their customer service. Everyone else seemed incompetent. Im not much of a review writer but I expect that when $300 a night is spent on a hotel, it should be a flawless experience. Once again the Hotel is beautiful, Seaport Village is right next door, and I would stay here again but I would advise someone to watch there card statement very closely with online/ on phone statements.

<Title>“Beautiful Views”
<Content>This is a beautiful hotel overlooking San Diego Bay. The rooms themselves need to be updated and are not quite as impressive as the views or the public spaces, but nonetheless are very comfortable. If you can get a room overlooking the bay, watching the ships in the bay (everything from sailboats to aircraft carriers) is worth the premium you pay to stay here. The hotel is a few blocks away from the Gaslamp Quarter, and is adjacent to a small bayside shopping village with a number of small shops and restaurants. It also is within an easy walk of the USS Midway museum, and is adjacent to the San Diego trolley system.

<Title>“A very decent place to stay”
<Content>My wife and I stayed in this hotel recently when she attended a conference. All in all it was a very, very nice hotel. Along with the regular amenities that come from a finer hotel, this one has the added bonus of being directly adjacent to Seaport Villiage. This shopping district gives you an excellent place to stroll, shop, dine, or just sit and admire the view of San Diego harbor. Also within easy walking distance is the Gaslamp District, with wonderful restaurants, a couple of movie theaters, and plenty of good places for people watching. With many of the rooms you get a small refrigerator; my suggestion is to walk the five or so blocks to Ralph's Grocery and stock up on small essentials (a bottle of wine, some fruit, etc.) and spend at least one night in, watch a movie on the large televisions, and just relax after a full day of exploring. Also, there is an excellent gym, a very nice roof top pool (with two hot tubs), and don't forget to have a drink (and drink in the view) from the Top of the Hyatt bar.

<Title>“Great service”
<Content>This hotel is typical Hyatt inside the room, and better than the average in the public areas. But what really sets it apart is the level of service. As I was about to catch a taxi to the zoo, the bell captain suggested I buy my zoo tickets from the concierge to avoid the long ticket lines at the zoo. The concierge not only sold me the tickets, but gave us valuable tips about visiting the zoo. Then the taxi hailer suggested I use the hotel car (a Denali) to get to the zoo for little more than what the taxi costs. The hotel car driver was exceptionally personable and made the drive over very pleasant. He even showed us where to find a taxi back and gave me his card should I need his service again. I did use him again to get to the airport. The concierge also gave us great recommendations on restaurants in Seaport Village, only 50 feet out the back door of the hotel. The Hyatt public areas are impressive. The lobby is huge. It has a nice little coffee shop where you can also get drinks and pastries. Redfields is a nice sports bar in the lobby. I did not use the pool or fitness center but they both looked very nice. The room was very good. The beds have comfortable pillowtops. We had a mini-fridge with no overpriced minibar drinks or snacks. The window opens for fresh air, but not so far as to present a danger to children falling out. They also do a good job of keeping the room quiet but you can still hear the train horns from the track less than 100 feet out the front door. What a place for a train track. The flatscreen TV was huge, the largest I've ever seen in a hotel, although the channel selection was a bit less than I am used to. There were only four small drawers in the dresser, but the closet was good size for overflow. The bathroom had great shower pressure. The bathroom amenities were quite nice except for the toilet paper which is ridiculously thin. The only drawback was there was no chair for sitting, just a desk chair. There was room by the window for a chair, but it would have been tight. They designed the room just a bit too small. Room service is very expensive and the water bottles in the room cost $5, so be forewarned. We also took advantage of the Hertz car rental desk in the lobby. That saved us from having to park a rental car at $26/day. The hotel is in a great location, less than 100 yards from San Diego Bay. We had great views from our room. Seaport Village is a very pleasant place to stroll even if the shops are overly touristy and do not really have anything I wanted to buy. Beyond Seaport Village is a nice park to walk around, surrounded on three sides by the bay, and looking out at Coronado. Downtown and the Gaslamp District are a short walk away, and there is a trolley stop within a block. I thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and would be very tempted to stay here again the next time I'm in San Diego.

<Title>“Great stay!”
<Content>We stayed on the 24th floor room 2465 on the bay/city side and had an amazing view. The Grant Lobby, beautiful decor, absolutely friendly personnel, and incredible attention to service will WOW you! Even thou our room was very nice and clean, it could use a little upgrade. The location is great, easy access in/out of the hotel and to Seaport Village, which has fantastic shops and fabulous cafes. If you have a least an hour, walk into Candle Gallery shop and get amazed with candle making techniques :-) The top of the Hyatt bar located on the 40th floor has most stunning views of the city. Come up there at sunset for a couple of martinis and you won’t be disappointed. We were very pleased with the Manchester Hyatt overall and definitely will be back!

<Content>Stayed here for a conference. good things: fantastic location right by Seaport village; staff very friendly and helpful. not so good: seemed very expensive even at conference rate; the rooms had seen better days. there were cracks in my bathroom tiles and the tile grouting was a bit discoloured. the decor is very dated. If it had a refurbishment it would be wonderful.

<Title>“Hyatt hotel San Diego”
<Content>Went on a girls weekend to San Diego and stayed at the manchester hyatt. Hotel was beautiful. Great location. Right outside the hotel there is a walk along the bay with many restaurants and shops. There is a trolley tour also that was very worthwhile, around $30 per person and it takes you to many points off interest, the zoo, old town, Coronado island, which we loved, lots of shopping and the famous Coronado hotel, make sure you go see it and have a drink overlooking the beach. Also, only a few blocks from the convention center and the main area for restaurants and bars.

<Title>“Lovely Waterfront Hotel”
<Content>We stayed in the Manchester Grand Hyatt while attending a conference in San Diego in early Feb, 2012. We had an average King room with floor to ceiling windows. The bathroom is a bit small and needs upgrading, but the shower always had hot water and was relaxing. There are enough lights in the room that you can read easily or work at the desk. There is also a small table for room service. The coffee maker is the single cup kind but only comes with travel (cardboard) cups. The TV is a large 52” Samsung--very nice. Our room was facing east, VERY HOT from sunrise until mid afternoon & the A/C doesn’t make it better. This room was a pet friendly room and our small dog was comfortable here. It smelled fresh and clean when we checked in, and we left it that way too. We also were given a pet package when we checked in, a small plastic water bowl and some dog cookies--“a nice touch” for the $30 extra charge. The cleaning staff was excellent. A downside is that the internet is expensive (we had to book a 3-day package and then another 1 day package to cover our 4 nights and 3 days, with about 10 hrs left over after we had checked out). Considering the price of a regular room, I felt this was pretty cheap. The cost of parking is also very high. Conference-wise: the breakfasts, snacks and luncheons were excellent. In conclusion, the location couldn’t be better--and that’s what they’re selling. However, they overcharge and they need to do some serious upgrading in their rooms.

<Title>“Sub par Grand Hyatt”
<Content>Stayed at the Grand Hyatt during a recent conference also being held at the Hyatt. The conference space was nice enough, but the rooms need updating. The walls were so thin that I could hear every conversation being had by neighbors on both sides. The room rate for the conference was very inflated. With a new Hilton on the other side of the convention center, a Marriott connected to the convention center and dozens of other nice hotels within walking distance, I can recommend paying a premium rate to stay at the Hyatt, even if your event is there. San Diego is beautiful and well worth the 10-minute walk to stay at an upgraded facility. On the plus side, they did have a nice pool area and the shower in my room appeared to have been recently re-tiled so at least it was clean and fresh.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>The staff at the hotel is very friendly. The concierge is the most helpful of any hotel I have stayed at. It was also nice to not feel like everything that everybody did for me was for a tip. I never felt like a tip was expected, not even when the bellman loaded my suitcase into the taxi. Every time I met a staff member in the hallway, they smiled and asked how my day was. The breakfast buffet was exceptional and they had different specials each day so it wasn't the exact same thing from one day to the next.

<Title>“Everything very nice, but not quite "Hyatt-nice"”
<Content>I stayed here with family over the Christmas holidays and overall it was a really great choice to explore the city and surrounding beach communities. The pool deck is truly spectacular with amazing views of the harbour and downtown San Diego - go for a late night jacuzzi or hang around the fire pits if it's cold. There's also a really nice gym that also overlooks the harbour and the chilled Eucalyptus towels were a nice touch. The rooms were nice, don't get me wrong, however they didn't really meet that "Wow!" Hyatt quality I typically expect from this chain. Also, beware of everything in your room which is chargeable - there were water bottles to welcome us and the "$5 each" was printed in such small font that I didn't even realize they weren't complimentary until the next morning. The location is really good - you can easily walk to Seaport Village, the Fish Market, and all the downtown night spots. Coronado is a quick 10 minute drive. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, but it's definitely not on par with other Hyatt's I've stayed at before.

<Content>I stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt in January. We were on the 27th floor and the views of the San Diego bay were AMAZING! The hotel was very nice and clean and we loved going to the 40th floor bar and checking out the views from there also. Seaport village is right behind the hotel and the gaslamp area is very close by also. The bathroom was nothing special, but the room was nice & cozy!

<Title>“Inconsistent”
<Content>The one-word title of this review pretty much sums it up. The location is great, the lobby is beautiful, the pool area is very nice, but... our room was just OK. For a Grand Hyatt, it didn't even match our room at the Hyatt Place in Mesa AZ (the lower end of the chain). The view from the room was fantastic and walking from the hotel to the gas lamp district and to the boardwalk(?) is very convenient, but the room felt just a tad tired. The concierges (we enlisted the service of 2) were very friendly and knowledgeable, but the service at the top-floor bar was disappointing. If you looked beyond the lobby and the location, you'd probably be a little disappointed. So all-in-all, an inconsistent experience.

<Content>I really love this hotel! I have stayed 5 times in January for a conference so I cannot really comment on the room rates, but this hotel is impeccably kept and it's location close to Seaport Village is really wonderful. The pool area is nice and the service overall is very good. I would definitely stay here with my own family given the opportunity. One small drawback of this hotel is that it is close to a train and on occasion I was woken by the gate bells at the rail crossing ringing for what seemed like an eternity.

<Title>“Good Service”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel with my husband from January 11-15, 2012. I was there for a work function, hubby was traveling with me. Check in quick and easy. Got a smoking room like we requested. Spent one night in our room with two double beds and asked to moved to a room with a king bed. Staff moved our luggage for us while we out touring around town. Rooms have great view over the water. Lots of windows, they even open, great TV, coffee maker with tea and coffee, mini bar and just a fair bathroom with a miniscule bathtub. Hotel is set up with 2 towers. Elevators do floors 1-19 and 20-40 so you have to make sure you get in the right one in the correct tower. A little confusing but you get the hang of it. Breakfast buffet is great but costs $30. Sports bar ok with very limited menu. Sallys has great food. Location is fabulous. You can walk out the back door and be right on the boardwalk with a beautiful little village for shopping and eating right there. You can walk to the Gas Lamp District and the USS Midway is just down the street. Take the ferry over the Coronado Island if you have time. Fun to just sit and watch all of the action happening in the bay itself, fighter jets flying over head, lots of ships in the bay and even saw several dolphins. Would I stay there if it wasn't a work event, probably not. I would look for a smaller boutique hotel that might be a little more intimate. Overall biggest complaint was the lack of hot water. It didn't matter what time I tried to take a bath or shower it was always cold. I complained and they took the buffet breakfast off the bill for myself and my husband. Great on their part but would have preferred a hot shower at least once.

Centrally located to wonderful restaurants, shopping and sporting events. We stayed the weekend of January 28-29, 2012. This is actually our third visit to the Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego. We enjoy the amenities offered and excellent service from staff members. This place is spotless and the grounds are clean and well kept. I must admit that I am not thrilled about the price to pay to park your vehicle overnight at the facility. I congratulate the management of the Grand Hyatt for maintaining such a beautiful facility.

<Content>The hotel has everything you need.. well besides quick food service :). There are some places right outside the side doors that have great breakfasts, lunches, coffee etc.. there is even a Ben and Jerrys. The hotel is more of a "resort" type feel as it is HUGE. You can easily get lost in here. Our room wasn't very "luxurious" which was a bummer because we paid $238 for the room. The last time we paid that was at the W in downtown New York. There we had location AND luxury. Its a great hotel if you want easy access to get around and have a rental car. It was fun although I would stay here with my family.. not just my spouse.

We were pleasantly surprised - it is big but gives you a very welcoming experience. Staff at reception desk and at the front door are great, very helpful and take the time to give you recommendations. The location of the hotel is great, we were able to walk most places. Restaurants were good, service all around good. Take the elevator to the top for a drink! We would stay again and would recommend it. We enjoyed our stay in San Diego.

<Title>“Nice hotel for a good price”
<Content>I have stayed at the Hyatt a few times in SD and think its a pretty good deal for the money. My only gripe about the place is parking. It costs $27 a day to self park at the hotel, that is just ridiculous considering the rate you are already paying to stay at the hotel. When I asked the hotel about this they said its because the hotel does not own the parking concession, its owned by a private 3rd party. Either way they should do something about that. The hotel is located smack in the middle of seemingly everything. I was never more than a 5 minute drive from anything I wanted to do.

<Title>“THE hotel in San Diego”
<Content>Had a convention here for the better part of the week, and must say I was very impressed from the minute I arrived to the time of my my departure. The entire staff always greeted me with the same smile and attentiveness throughout the stay. While the lobby was having some painting done on some of the interior walls, it did not hinder the experience or take away from the beautiful architecture. The hotel itself was very majestic from the exterior with two towering structures (I was told it's the tallest hotel on the west coast). My room on the 31st floor was a decent size, with a great HDTV and view of the harbor. The location could not have been better, which was great because the transportation in San Diego is sub-par for a city of its size. My only criticism of this Hyatt was the very slow internet and elevators from the 29-40 floors.

<Title>“Convention Hotel”
<Content>My husband and 2 children and I stayed for 4 nights. I was very disappointed, especailly when the rate on my room was double what I had expected, and what they had emailed me! I do not recommend paying extra for conciege level. They comp people with privlidges up there and it is always too full and the desserts diappear within seconds of being put out. I found the staff at the front desk to be a bit rude, and the attendents on the concierge level are not concierges as they decribe in the room discription. Also the marble bathrooms in the room discriptions should be changes to, ceramic tile bathroom and marble sink! They definitely are use to dealing with people that are having there companies picking up the tap, and not questioning every little charge. I spent an hour afterwards filling out a survey with extreme detail, and noted for them to contact me and It's been 2 weeks and I have not heard a word. On the bright side, the location is great, but there are may other hotels near by to choose from. For $400 a night I would rather have stayed at Hotel Del! everything you read about the train noise here is true. Even with windows closed we were woken up evey night by the troley and then by the freight train!

<Title>“Tasteful, friendly, super breakfast buffet”
<Content>My son and I stayed for one night on Wednesday, December 21, 2011. We felt welcome from the moment we arrived until the moment we departed. The level of service was excellent - warm welcome at check-in, a replacement for a forgotten razor speedily delivered with a smile, and most gracious service during our breakfast. We were sorry we didn't have the opportunity for a longer stay. Thanks to the staff at the Manchester Grand for a very pleasant stay.

<Title>“THE ONLY PLACE TO STAY IN SAN DIEGO”
<Content>Well where do I begin. I have been staying at this outstanding hotel for the last several years. First off, the location is the best, right near the Seaport Village and near the Gaslamp district (Convention center is also nearby) and the San Diego Trolley (Metro) is 50 feet away. That being said, the hotel is outstanding. Very modern and so clean. Checking in is a breeze (if your a Platinum or Diamond member with Hyatt you have your own check in area) as I am a Diamond member. The rooms are oustanding and the views are incredible. Every room has some sort of view of the harbor and/or city. The rooms are very modern and spacious. The beds are the most comfortable ones around it is even hard to get up in the morning. The pool area is great and inviting. The service is impeccable, every one of the staff members goes out of their way to assist you and make your stay most memorable. The restaurant choices are all good too and the Top of the Hyatt bar and lounge on the 40th floor is a view to die for. You must have a drink there. When issues come up sometimes during our stays, they were fixed promptly and it was made right. Example went to the Grand Club to get a snack, but since they were extremely busy no items left in the club, so I told the front desk and presto the items I wanted were delivered to my room free of charge. It is those extra things that count. In seeing some of the other reviews, I don't know what happened during their stays, but if you are not happy speak to someone in charge to make it right. That is what Hyatt does for its guests. Enjoy your stay at this hotel, you will like it.

<Title>“Service Not As Expected ...”
<Content>Typical standard Hyatt room, which equates to nothing special. There were two issues with the room. The first was that the toilet ran constantly. They did fix this issue with just one call. The second issue was that the electric socket above the bathroom sink would not hold anything that was plugged into it securely thus the device (such as an electric razor) would work intermittently. I called several times to see if they could either fix or replace the socket (which costs less that $5 at most hardware stores). It was never fixed nor was there ever a call back or message left as to why it was not fixed. After three calls, I gave up and used my razor from another socket. This was difficult since all other sockets in the room were at a lower level on the wall and the razor has a short cord. The hotel is quite a ways from the Gaslamp Quarter and their parking garage charges $26 a day for parking. So, we parked only the first night at the hotel. We parked in an ACE parking lot nearby for $10 a day from that point forward. However we were charged $130 for parking by the hotel when we checked out which was remedied by the hotel. They should not have assumed that we would park each day when we only charged one day of parking to the room. I've stayed at the Mancherster Grand Hayatt many times over the past 10 years. I visit San Diego about twice a year. I think that I'll try a different downtown hotel next time.

<Title>“Tired, dated and full of hidden costs”
<Content>I traveled here with my family over xmas/new years. We travel to San Diego reguarly, perhaps making 3-4 trips per year and this hotel would probably be our least favorite of the ones we've visited. general observations are that due to this hotel being huge (2 huge towers) it feels impersonal, it has also changed ownership and new management is not on the ball. location- the manchester is downtown but removed from the gaslamp quarter where all the action is but still walkable. service- We found that several members of the staff were rude and not helpful. this is by no means a reflection on the entire staff as some of the club lounge servers and concierge went out of their way to be accomodating, but the few rude individuals such as the front desk clerk who checked us in left a bad first impression cleanliness- this is a very big hotel which , however we found that the overall cleanliness and attention to detail was sloppy. for example on our first day we noticed a cigarette butt in the corner of the hallway on our floor. a few hours later we returned only to find it still there. the next morning it was still there. we pushed it into the middle of the hallway to see if they would finally see it; about a day and a half later it was finally cleaned up. i have the impression that very few rounds are made by the staff due to lax management. restaurants- definently try Lael's buffet for breakfast, the selection is huge and the quality is very good except for the sushi which tasted dry. Sally's has a nice atmosphere and the sushi is very good, make sure you try their cream cheese roll. rooms- the rooms were advertised as renovated but just when they were renovated would be interesting to find out. It looks as though just the wallpaper was changed and that itself was ugly and outdated. The rooms and the hallways looked tired and dated, the carpets faded, the bathrooms old with cracked and yellowing tubs and sinks. there were never enough towels, we had to keep on calling housekeeping. None of the little toiletries like lotion or shower cap were provided, we had to call for those. The view was average; mostly of buildings with peek-a-boo water views. beds were small and lumpy. smelled musty. pets- very dog friendly (yay!) club lounge- way to small for the number of rooms it was supposed to serve, overcrowded. it was a pain to find seating in the morning. also understaffed, the poor servers were sweating trying to clear tables. value- this was the part that bothered us the most. this hotel nickel and dimes you for everything. self-parking is $26/day, if you want to have a package/parcel sent to the hotel they will charge you a $10 service fee to receive it for you. wifi is $10/day if you want it in your room, it is free in the lobby but the connection is terrible as can be seen by the people walking around the lobby with their phones and ipads in the air trying to hook onto the network. all in all there are better options: if you're looking to be in the middle of the action and want to enjoy the San Diego nightlife go to the Andaz (formerly the Ivy.) its part of the Hyatt umbrella now and is their trendy boutique line. iwifi there is free, valet-parking is $12/day, some of the mini-bar items are free and you get free access to the rooftop pool/bar which is the place to be during the weekend and hard to get into. its in the middle of the gas-lamp quarter which is where all the nightlife is. if you're traveling with family/kids and don't mind driving try the Loews on Coronado. Beautiful property overlooking the marina with the exact feel and architecture you would expect from socal. also very pet friendly.

<Title>“Tired hotel - stay elsewhere & BEWARE”
<Content>I just returned from a sales meeting at this hotel. It is a massive hotel (2 towers with 40 floors each) but unfortunately they don't have enough staff or elevators to accommodate. The first wait started with checkin - we had to get in a long line of 30+ people to wait to be checked into our room (and had to wait in line again to check out). There were several times a day where I had to wait to get on an elevator to get up to my room as there where heaps of people in front of me that would fill up one elevator after the other and I'd finally get on the 5th or 6th elevator. The rooms are tired, the food was the worst I've experienced, the spa was overpriced and the spa technician kept trying to upsell me the whole time I had my pedicure which made for a less relaxing spa experience. and here is the BEWARE. A colleague of mine reported that she returned to her room and found the maid rooting around in her pill container that had a mixture of her vitamins and Tylenol! When she reported this to the hotel they were very dismissive and said "IF this actually occurred they will deal with it" The only thing going for this hotel is the location but there are about 20 other hotels nearby. I'd pick one instead. I should also mention this is a huge sales conference hotel, as we were clearing out another one was setting up. So if you're looking for a place to go for a personal vacation and don't want to be overrun by 3000 conferencees, this is not the place for you.

<Content>This is the second time that we've stayed at the Manchester Hyatt... it is a gorgeous hotel, with incredible views in an unbeatable location! The lobby is absolutely breathtaking, and the rooms are beautiful. My only word of caution is just to be aware of the extra fees... $26/night for parking and $11 (?)/24 hours for internet...

<Title>“Great”
<Content>I stayed here on New Year's eve 2011. The Hyatt has a beautiful wide-open lobby and it's a short walk from your car (if you don't valet) to check in. The staff was friendly and hotel atmosphere was very welcoming. This is also a very easy hotel to get in and out of traffic-wise, which not true for some of the other hotels in the area. The parking fee was pretty steep, around $25, but that's pretty standard for the downtown San Diego area. As far as our room, we had a great view of the ocean. The room was very clean and comfotable. The beds were really soft! Overall, the service and accomodations are everything you'd expect from a Hyatt, and this one certainly doesn't disappoint. I didn't personally eat here, but the restaurant looked first rate. I did try the on-site coffee shop, they can make a mean mocha! The best attribute of this particular hotel is the location. Seaport Village is literally on the doorstep of the hotel, and the USS Midway, the convention center, Petco Park, and all of the Gaslamp district are within very easy walking distance. The only downside I experienced here was that the walls seemed pretty thin. I could hear people in the adjacent rooms, and could clearly hear an entire conversation when I was in the bathroom. I didn't take away much from my stay here, but I could see it being an issue if the neighbors next door are loud. Overall, I would still absolutely recommend this place to families, vacationers, weekenders, and for business travel. There's something for everyone in the downtown San Diego area.

<Title>“Wonderful Location”
<Content>My husband attended medical conference (ASH) in San Diego . We spent close to a week at the Manchestar Hyatt. Overall , we were very impressed. The location is fanastic....right on the harbor. The quaint Seaport Village , which loads of restaurants and cute shops, was a hop away. The famous Gaslamp area was within walking distance , as well as a nice shopping mall (Horton). We had a beautiful view from our room. The room itself wasn´t spectacular...the decor was a bit dated ( forest green theme) and the bathroom could certainly use a makeover.But the beds were very comfortable and the service was great. Another highlight was the delicious breakfast buffet at Lael´s.....the best waffles I´ve ever had. I really enjoyed our stay and would return again.

<Title>“Good, but not Grand”
<Content>I always like to give a quick bit of background info and disclaimers to put the review in perspective, so here goes. After working for Hyatt Hotels for 15 years I am a bit of a hotel "snob" so take some of my pickiness with a grain of salt. In addition, this was a buisness trip that didn't allow me to use, explore or appreciate all of the facitities at the hotel so my reivew will reflect that perspective. Checked in arond 1pm to a well staffed front desk in a beautiful lobby. The desk clerk was efficient and helpful and gave me all the information that I needed and I was on my way. There are two towers in the hotel, Harbor Tower (older tower) and the Sea[something] tower (newer tower). From comments that I heard from fellow meeting goers, the Sea[something] tower rooms were a bit nicer and more up-to-date. The room itself was very spacious with nice dark wood funiture that included a big desk (w/outlet) end tables, dresser and a chair ottoman combo. The dresser contained a room safe, fridge (no mini bar) and three drawers on the smaller side, two phones, iHome clock radio, wired and wireless internet connections. Both we complimentary for me but that could have been a meeting perk. Big 42" flat screen with usable computer monitor and HDMI connections. Hair dryer and magnifying mirror in the bathroom. The carpet looked relatively new. No balcony rooms from what I can see. My room had a decent view of the opposite tower, with downtown to my left and the harbor to my right. The bed was decent but not the most confortable I've ever been in. The pillows did not appear to be feather but seemed to stuffed with some kind of chunky synthetic filling. The conforter was a bit thin as well. The bed was well worn on one side but quite firm and more comfortable on the other side. General hotel bed tip - if you like a firmer mattress, always sleep on the side of the bed opposite the alarm clock. Most people will sleep on the alarm clock side and it will wear down quicker. The bathroom was simple but clean and in good shape. OK counter space. The tub/shower was a bit on the small side and did not have a bowed shower curtain as I've seen in other hotels. The shower pressure itself would make Karen Silkwood proud. Shower pressure is a real hot button of mine but I can say this is the first hotel where I would have liked to turn it down a bit. I did feel better though knowing I started each day here radiation free. :-) Location, location, location. The hotel couldn't be better situated. About a 5-10 minute walk from the Gaslamp Quarter and Petco Park (Baseball/Padres). Tons of shopping and a restaurant for any type of food you can imagine. Nice place to just walk around as well. In addition, there is the Seaport Village directly behind the hotel. More shopping and restaurants that is literally two minutes from the building. The train tracks are near by and you can hear the train whistle on a fairly regular basis from both the light rail and Amtrack style trains. It didn't bother me much but I could see how some folks could get a little bonkers from it although they do seem to stop running by 11pm or midnight. I didn't swim but the pool looked well kept but small. The do run three good sized fire pits at night in the pool area. That's about all can speak to. Overall it was a very nice stay but did not live up to the image I had in my mine when I heard it was a Grand Hyatt (a title Hyatt usually reserves for their more spectacular hotels). I would stay here again for business without hesitation but would at least investigate other options if I was bringing the family back for a vacation. Happy Travels, Sulu

<Content>This is a huge hotel. The lobby is grand and beautiful. Checkin and checkout lines can be long. Service is good for a large convention type hotel. Rooms are modern, clean and typically Hyatt. (in other words, comfortable but with no atmosphere or imagination). The location is excellent. It's right next to Seaport Village, the convention center, walking distance to the Gaslamp district, and you can walk forever along the waterfront of the bay. Ate at the sports bar and it was quite good, fun and reasonable. Also had late night cocktails in the lobby bar. Quite good also.

<Title>“Nice Hotel. Convenient location.”
<Content>My stay was in late December 2011. It's slow period for this property so I got a very reasonable rate and a free upgrade to a higher-floor room. The view from my 28th floor room in the south tower was one of the best I've ever had in any hotel I've stayed at. I could view the harbor, downtown, and even view airplanes landing at the airport. The room itself was clean, modern and spacious. The bathroom was very clean, although maybe slightly dated by today's standards, but nothing that bothered me. It didn't bother me much, but travelers that get distracted by noise may be bothered by commuter rail sounds (San Diego Trolley, Coaster, Amtrak and crossing gate noises). The trains are constant from before the sun rises to very late in the evening. If you're bothered by this, try to ask for a higher room facing the ocean, and not facing Shoreline Drive. The location is very convenient. You can walk to the Gaslamp District, Downtown and many tourist spots along the harbor. The trolley across the street can take you to other places (Old Town, Tijuana, etc.). If you plan on visiting Balboa Park/San Diego Zoo, you'll need to inquire about transportation to get there if you don't have a car. The only gripes I have (which has been mentioned in other posts) is the high cost for parking ($26 a day) and internet (about $13 a day). They say they have special packages for these services, but they don't save much. But in all, there's nothing wrong with this hotel. Staying here is a very good choice for first time visitors, or visitors already familiar with the area.

<Title>“Typical Convention Hotel - but they try hard”
<Content>Upon arrival, I was supposedly booked in a king room - but got two doubles. Ok, not a big deal. I had a lovely view but with the view, I also got the train horn and fog horn - again, obviously not the hotel's fault - but if you are a light sleeper - I'd suggest staying inland a bit. Even just a few streets make a difference. Gaslamp Marriott, Kimpton or Westin don't have the noise levels that I experienced here. I am looking forward to the updates in 2012 as the rooms/suites and conference rooms are clearly out of date. (The tv's are huge now - but wireless is HORRIBLE!) I did make a complaint to housekeeping as the double bed linens don't actually fit the beds - which results in 1/3 of the bed being without sheets covering the mattress pad. They immediately responded and were incredibly customer service focused (kudos!) The folks at Redfields (one of the bars) are terrific - food is good and service is great. All in all, a very good convention hotel. I wouldn't stay here if I wasn't at a convention. Too many other great options in the area.

<Content>Beautiful, if not over-the-top, hotel with awesome views in a prime San Diego location. Very quiet even though in the busy part of town -- we had a nice room towards the end of the hall on one of the top floors of the south tower with a magnificent, sweeping view of the bay. The room was amply sized and very comfortable. We got a great rate on the park and surf package which included self-parking and Internet -- and there was a room ready for us early in the day! Now that the hotel is owned and managed by Host Marriott, we would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Title>“Pleasant stay”
<Content>The lobby area is fabulous! Checked in by a very pleasant girl (Kenia?) who answered all of our questions about the area and gave us a nice corner room on the 29th floor with a lovely view of both the city and the bay.The room was spacious and comfortable and we were not bothered in the least by train noises as mentioned by other reviewers. The gym, pool and hot tubs were also top notch. My only complaints would be that we needed 2 beds and they only had rooms with 2 doubles (very tight for 2 people!). I also found that the bathroom wasn't very well ventilated thus stinking up the whole room when used, not pleasant, lol! My major gripe however with the Hyatt chain, has more to do with internet and their business center. They charge internet by the device not the room so my husband, son and I would each have to pay a fee of $10.95/24 hrs. Ridiculous! They also do not have a free business center thus a credit card is required for everything. If internet and business services are important, the Hyatt is not for you (unless of course you belong to their platinum Passport program).

<Title>“Why do you charge someone for an early checkin?”
<Content>I have such high expectations from Hyatt brand hotels and seems this one fell short. It seems they are not taking care of the hotel. I am a gold passport member and they actually wanted to charge me for a early checkin and a view. Why are they nickling and diming us to death. That used to be a standard option for frequent travelers if available. So off I went to complain only to be told that they changed the program and that it is not an offering anylonger and that I had "clicked" a button that said I agreed to the charge. Well ok... I am out hyatt.... its not necessary and Marriott is upgrading most of their facilities... I'm on to the next one! Ciao!

<Title>“Wonderful Hotel for holiday stay”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights between Christmas & NY. We got a great rate from the hotel website that included the buffet breakfast at Lael's restaurant. The food there was excellent & the choices were many. We had large room in the newer tower where we were able to see part of downtown & part of the bay. The rooms were comfortable & clean. There may have been an issue with 3G service in the area as my phone battery discharged faster than at home. But, that is not the hotel's problem. There is a train that goes by but it was not a problem in the evening. The hotel is convenient to the Gaslamp Area & Seaport Village. There are many wonderful restaurants in that area. There is also a trolley across the street that will take visitors to many other areas of the city.

<Title>“4 Star Lobby with 3 Star Rooms”
<Content>This hotel from the driveup to the lobby is very very nice, the rooms and hallways are lacking. The hotel lobby, restaurant, and general amenities are very nice and don't leave much to be desired. The rooms however are extremely lacking. Once you exit the elevator the hotel drops a few notches on the cleanliness chain. The room really lacks any true amenities above what you would expect from any hotel. The room linens and decorations are old and were probably breathtaking in 1992 but not anymore. The art is old, the furniture has seen better days, and the showers are standard chain motel tubs. The hotel lobby and Redfields Restaurant are awesome and really make the place worth the stay. The staff was also super friendly and professional. The location is a bit of a walk from the Gaslamp and in a more secluded spot near the harbor. The hotel is nice don't get me wrong but there are much newer and better located options in SD now. The center of the action has shifted over the years and is no longer focused in Seaport Village area. If you want a downtown San Diego walk out of your lobby and be in the action I would choose the following. The Solomar, Omni, Marriot on K are all in the same price ranges and blow this hotel out of the water as far as service, amenities, location, and general perks.

<Title>“Nice location. Closer to Shopping and Restaurants”
<Content>This is our second stay at the hotel. The reason we chose the hotel was the service and location. The service has been outstanding so far and the location was close to a shopping village and restaurants. The self parking as usually around the downtown is not free and not cheap either. We stayed at Hilton before a few blocks a way and the parking rate was pretty much the same. So, expect to spend this $$$. We were given a room at 23rd floor. The room was clean and nice. The only thing we have to call the front desk for was the sink was draining very slow. I have to call front desk twice before the problem was fixed. The room was quiet except you do hear freight train passing by around mid night and sounded the honk. It is a common issue for hotels around the area (Hyatt, Marriott, Hilton). We got the view to the sound side of the town. So, there is nothing much to see. One thing to watch for is the door. You could accidentally slam the door since there is no tensioner to slow down the door when you close it. We have heard this from other rooms as well and it could become annoying if you start hearing this too many times. Hope Hyatt could address this issue. We did not have a chance to use the pool as it was fairly cold at night during Christmas. We had breakfast at the hotel and it was buffet style. The breakfast opens from 6am to 11am. I would suggest to show up before 9am or there will quite a line waiting to be seated. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and we would go back again.

<Title>“Amazing Spot!”
<Content>This hotel has it all - two pools, a phenomenal fitness center, fantastic location, and a staff that is superb. The hotel itself is gorgeous and offers phenomenal views of the bay. Stay in the business section if you can, then you have access to the 32 nd floor lounge that always has goodies on hand to enjoy. Its busy, but that could be reflective of the fact that it is a great hotel.

<Title>“Save your money”
<Content>Upon arriving check in was quick. When we arrived at our room we noticed an unpleasant odor in the hallway and once again in our room. This odor was confirmed by others in our group that stayed in different rooms on the same floor. The room was not great but nice. Our bathroom had no toilet paper so I called down to the front desk and asked for some and also complained about the odor in our room. The operator said she would send engineering up. Twenty minutes later we received our toilet paper and never heard anything again about the outcome of the smell we dealt with the rest of the trip. We emptied our fragrance bottles during the trip to make the room smell pleasant. Our fault for not complaining again I guess. The view from the room was beautiful but it is not worth it considering the trolley bells and the freight train horn that goes through at 3 am. Unless you’re a heavy heavy sleeper you can’t have your window open. I was even awaken by the aforementioned sounds with the window closed. The common areas of the hotel are very nice and the location to the gas lamp and seaport village is convenient. The prices at the Hyatt for a beer ($8+) and a Mai Tai ($10+) are a bit of gouging in my opinion but I expected that and did most of our leisure activities outside the Hyatt. On a side note we stayed in the older tower so I cannot review the new tower. I have said this more than once, you just don’t get what you pay for these days.

<Title>“Nice "staycation"”
<Content>We found a good deal online for the club level for Christmas night so we decided to book a room last minute. When we arrived they had run out of rooms on the club level so they upgraded us to a room with a better view and still gave us access to the club level and lounge. The view was amazing and the room was comfortable. We loved the pillows and are considering contacting the hotel to see if we can purchase a few of them for home. The bathrooms could use some updating and showed the most wear and tear. We enjoyed a drink at the Top of the Hyatt bar late Christmas night and the service was great and the view spectacular. The only disappointment was that they had stopped serving most food and had run out of many desserts and things such as whipped cream which was supposed to top the martini I ordered. Our waitress was very attentive and even brought us a complimentary dessert since they were out of so many things. We enjoyed a nice breakfast at the buffet and were impressed with the service and quality of food. Overall we think the hotel could use a little TLC but would not hesitate to recommend it! One small negative-parking is $36 for valet and $26 for self parking. Unfortunately it is pretty much standard in San Diego that you will pay for parking so we have learned to expect it.

The hotel is huge and super nice, has tons to do pool etc. Pet friendly I mean ever person seemed to have their dog with them. The bar is small but nice and great service, and good drinks. The rooms left a little to be desired! The bed's pillows out of this world cozy, mattress not so much, The room smelled a little of smoke and seemed a little outdated for such a lovely hotel. Water pressure out of this world good in the shower! Now the A/C didn't work AT ALL! Thank goodness it wasn't summer or we wouldn't have slept at all!

<Title>“Getaway well worth the price”
<Content>Staff are professional, helpful, and friendly. The breakfast buffet is really nice and well worth the price (especially when using the AAA discount) This is a close to home getaway for my husband and I. It's location is ideal for anyone wanting to be close to the waterfront, downtown SD, and even Balboa Park (most of which you can walk to, even the park if your adventurous). The Top of The Hyatt Bar is an ideal place to watch the sunset or end an evening (only an elevator ride away to your room) This is not a cheap hotel, but once more, it is well worth the price. We love the Manchester Hyatt!

<Content>Located near the gas lamp district, easy walking distance. The propery is beautiful from the outside but the rooms could use a make-over. What sold this and makes it a "must go back to" spot is the level of service. The service was so strong it keep the rating at excellent even with the rooms less than perfect. Recommend staying on a top floor, the view is incredible.

We walked to the Gaslight Quarter which has many restaurants of many varieties of cuisine. The trolley can also be taken to Old Town and other locations such as Qualcomm Stadium. Old town has many shops and Mexican restaurants plus historical buildings of early San Diego.

<Content>The Manchester Grand is a beautiful hotel overlooking downtown San Diego & the bay. The hotel is "Grand" in every sense. Massive, beautiful lobby. Beautiful views of the Pacific & the city. There are 2 towers. When we checked in they gave us a room on the 38th floor in the old tower. Great views, but the room was very old and dingey. Old bathroom fixtures and smelled musty. we asked to change rooms and they upgraded us to a parlor suite in the new tower. What a difference! Everything was nicer. The checkin process was a breeze. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Valet is great. You are within walking distance to the Gaslamp district and amazing restaurants. Overall, a great place to stay.

<Content>I love this hotel situated in downtown San Diego. They treat you right from the moment you walk in the door until the moment you leave. The lobby is very grand with tall, tall ceilings. Since we stayed there the week before Christmas, the lobby was beautifully decorated and they had their annual display of gingerbread houses made by students of nearby schools. This was our 3rd time staying there and we've never been disappointed. The rooms are large and nicely furnished. We've always requested a high floor with a good view and they have always delivered. The breakfast buffet is excellent. They have an omelet station, fresh waffles, amazing pastries, fruit and all the normal breakfast fare.

<Title>“Awesome”
<Content>The lobby, the main areas and the rooms were all very big. The 46" flatscreens were awesome too. I stayed in the 10th floor, with a view to the Coronado bridge, downtown, and the bay. It was great. About the train that passes close to many hotels (not only the Hyatt), it does make a lot of noise with its whistle (much less when you are inside your room). I heard it a couple of hours before going to sleep, but after that neither my wife or I heard it, so it was no problem. Definitely will stay again when we go back to San Diego. Oh, and we stayed with our 15 lb dog, just in case someone is wondering, no weird smells or pet-friendly "smells" or stains.

<Title>“Spectacular View of the Coronado Bridge and Bay & Great Location”
<Content>We stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San Diego November 11th - 17th. The hotel is slightly dated and while we were there the air conditioning went out for a day but we discovered that you can open the window to your room for fresh air. The staff is very friendly and accommodating and the hotel is in a great location. You are in walking distance of the Seaport Village & Shops, San Diego Repertory Theater, Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, The Midway Aircraft Carrier Museum, Navy Pier, Westfield Horton Plaza, San Diego Convention Center, Maritime Museum of San Diego, Petco Park, and the Gaslamp District. Your really don't need to rent a car if you're going to be staying here unless you're traveling out further than the trolley will take you. We made use of the Grand Club for Breakfast, Snacks, Cocktails, and desserts and we were very pleased. We did not dine at the hotel, we found restaurants behind the hotel in the Seaport Village that offered a great variety and pleasant atmosphere. While in San Diego you must hit the Tin Fish Gaslamp for lunch and cocktails next to the Omni Hotel which is a great hotel to stay at also. For entertainment the Shout House in the Gaslamp District is a must.

<Title>“NOT a good hotel for business”
<Content>I stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt for a convention as it was close to the convention center and the MArriott where the rest of the meetings were held. The lobby and the public spaces, inclduing meeting rooms and ballrooms were very impressive. The sleeping rooms were very comfortable, but peole should be aware that they should NOT conduct any business or use the phone while in the rooms - every word can be heard by rooms on either side either through the connecting doors, or even in the room next door without the connecting door. I could hear every sound, every cough, every conversation, and every physical activity (ahem!) as if the person or people were in my room. For a hotel that hosts a lot of business travellers, this is unacceptable. Also be aware that food service is extremely limited for a hotel with 1600+ rooms. Lael's is small and extremely crowded for breakfast. In spite of the cost, use room service for breakfast if you really need something to eat in the morning. It also has extremely limited hours. I arived at 7 PM looking for dinner and it was alerady closed. The menu at the "sports bar" leaves a lot to be desired. Finally, be aware that the gift shop is closing - there is no place to buy sundries in the hotel.

<Title>“Nice location, but some things need a refresh”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt in mid-November. We had reserved a king-bed room, but when we arrived, we were initially told that there were no more king rooms, and nothing could be done. We told the desk clerk that a reservation is a reservation, and as we had reserved a king room, there was no reason that they should have given that room away. The clerk went into the back offices, and came back a few minutes later, telling us that she had "found" a king room by moving other reservations around. The location is great--right next to the Seaport Village shops, and just a short walk to the U.S.S. Midway aircraft carrier museum, and the Gaslamp Quarter. It is also very convenient to the San Diego Convention Center. The hotel lobby is magnificent with lots of marble and high ceilings. There are two towers, with different shops and restaurants in each. Overnight parking (self-service) was $26 per night. But this was offset by the fact that we had a full breakfast buffet (normally $25 per person) included in the room rate, which was reasonable. We had a king-sized room with a view overlooking the pool, and beyond, San Diego Bay. Room was comfortable, with a big screen HDTV and a mini-fridge. I had a few problems with the bathroom. There was some paint chipping off the bathroom door, and the bathroom itself could have used a bit of an update. We had some problems with the wi-fi connection (which costs $9.95 per 24-hours) but when we complained to the hotel desk, they waived the charge for our entire stay. The desk staff seemed very committed to making things right whenever possible. Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much. I'd recommend this hotel if you need to be near the Convention Center, the seaport, or the Gaslamp Quarter.

<Title>“Standard, with some pros and cons”
<Content>If you've stayed at one of the nicer upscale brand (think Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott) mega-sized conference hotels, then you know what to expect from the Manchester Grand. I'll just sort my thoughts into pros and cons. Pros: - Location. It's two doors down from the convention center, and you can walk to all the Gaslamp District restaurants and bars. - Service. The staff were all very nice, from check-in to check-out. I'm Gold Passport Platinum, and I got an upgrade certificate in the mail the day before I left. While they couldn't accommodate me in a Grand Club room, they gave me a great room on the 22nd floor of the new tower and Grand Club privileges. - The Grand Club lounge was nice, and I grabbed a snack and a drink a couple of times. Very standard, nothing particularly nice or bad here. - The lobby is quite impressive. - They gave me a 1 PM late checkout, even though they were full. - The health club was nice, though full, and the hot tub was a great way to relax after a workout. - The beds are very nice, whatever Hyatt's version of the Westin "Heavenly Bed" is. I slept quite well, though these are available at any Hyatt property. - The view is great, from a high floor. Views of the harbor and downtown. - Amenities were standard -- LCD TV with a decent selection of channels, strong but not-so-fast internet, fridge, etc. - Self-parking, which is preferable to valet parking IMHO. There is a valet option, but I hate waiting for a car. Cons: - When the hotel was full, as it was during my stay, it seems really crowded. The elevators take several minutes to go down, the health club gets overcrowded, the pool area is full, etc. It makes the place feel like a bit of a factory. - The room, even a king bed room, was relatively small. - The walls are thin. I was using the bathroom and thought I heard the phone ring, but it was actually the phone in the room next door. I had no noise problems, but noisy neighbors would have been heard here. - The decor and furniture were somewhat dated, honestly. They say they'll be renovating, and I hope it looks much nicer when they are done. - The bathtub was small and the shower not quite tall enough. Do they not get enough 6'2 business travelers to warrant raising the shower head? - I checked in with my boyfriend and got the cock-eyed look and question, "Is one king bed OK?" Well, I'm entitled to a confirmed bed upon reservation (thanks GP Platinum), and I reserved a king-sized bed. Why wouldn't it be OK? I don't take it as anti-gay or whatever, I just know I wouldn't have been asked that question had we been a straight couple.

<Content>I am amazed by the Manchester Grand Hyatt - I was immediately wow'ed by the high ceilings of the lobby and general huge size of the hotel. The rooms were great - maybe a little bit dated for my taste but that is hyatt for you. Huge LCD tv, mini fridge, telephone and internet facilities, coffee maker, basic amenities provided in bathroom. Very comfortable beds - I slept well with no noise disruption. Location wise couldn't be better, room views over looking the harbor. Short walking distance to most must see attractions. Staff will provide a map if you need it and are happy to give you directions.

<Content>Stayed here for a weekend getaway and attended a swim worshop as well. Over all experience at this hotel is average, but wish we were able to stay longer in SD and experience more of the city. Below is my input regarding this hotel: Accommodation - Comfortable beds, nice large 45 LCD TV and every angle of your hotel room will have a nice view. Bathroom - For a high end hotel, I must say that the bathroom is old and outdated. Nothing special about it just the fact that everything works and comes with a blow dryer. Staff - Everyone is very helpful and friendly. We requested for a late check out to be extended til 2:00PM and they were able to accommodate us with no problem. Location - Great place to stay. Walking distance to the bay and shopping village. Few blocks away from a large mall and Gas Lamp District.

<Title>“Nice Hotel - not enough staff”
<Content>Stayed here for a conference. Location can't be beat for easy convention center access. Nice path along the harbor right out the back door as well as several good relatively inexpensive restaurants for a quick lunch. Arrived late - staff friendly at check-in. They didn't have a King bed as I requested and my room looked directly into a cement wall. When I called down to see if I could change rooms, they said they could give me a complementary upgrade to a room with a water view if I'd wait until the next day. New room had nice view, clean - pretty average, but nice. Bags took two hours to arrive from old room because the front desk forgot to communicate with Bell stand. When I called to inquire, staff was very sorry and bags arrived shortly thereafter. Rest of stay was uneventful. Needed to print something and the business office charged ~$5.50 for a 13 page document (computer rental fee and cost per page). Seemed a little steep, but I don't usually use hotel business centers. In-room internet cost $10/day.

<Content>Staying at the Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego is like staying at a motel six. Rooms are old, walls are thin, beds are very uncomfortable. Reserved a king, ended up with 2 doubles. The last time we tried to stay here we were put up at another hotel because they over booked. Now I see it was a blessing. Over priced. Location is good but won't do it again.

Our room on the 30th floor overlooking San Diego Bay was nicely appointed with an electronic console for business/office needs. The tv was huge, maybe 52", very large for the room. The staff were all gracious and helpful. The hotel also had an excellent fitness facility and a beautiful view of sunsets from the the 40th floor lounge. There were many choices for meals off property only a few minutes walk to Seaport Village. A 10-minute walk will get you to the Gas Lamp district with many more options for meals and shopping.

<Content>Stayed one night here in June. Check-in was fast and efficient -- Hyatt standards for the staff. Zoomed up to my room on a high floor, had a nice view of the city and partial view of the bay. Room could stand some updating -- was surprised by the "creakiness" of the furniture, especially the -- table stand is the only way I can describe it -- in the bathroom. Didn't serve a purpose that I could see, and was all banged up. Tacky! Bed was very comfortable, and soundproof. Lots of pillows. Proximity to Seaport Village and the Convention Center is a plus, of course. Parking charge no fun -- $25 a night -- but not much can be done about that. Would stay there again for the view and location.

Excellent location, near the convention center and the Gaslamp Quarter.The walking from the hotel to the bay was great.

<Title>“Great hotel, beautiful view”
<Content>We went to San Diego for our anniversary weekend during Thanksgiving weekend for two nights. We had a great time at the Manchester Grand Hyatt which is very close to the downtown Gaslamp area. The staff were very courteous and helpful and always greeting the guests and offering to help them with luggage, doors etc. We were impressed with the cleaning staff because we left something in our room but the staff picked it and kept it in the lost and found and when we called to enquire, the lost article was kept aside for us :) Overall its a beautiful hotel in a perfect location which is walking distance to the shops and restaurants and other hotels and buildings. The two towers of the hotel are joined by one long lobby with many hotel staff to serve so that guests are not waiting in long line ups. We had a gorgeous view of the bay which looked beautiful during the day, and a view of the hotels and downtown city area at night. The room and washroom was clean and very spacious. The only downfall is that parking is $26 per night and since it is close to a downtown location it is hard to find other reasonable parking. But the upside was that once we parked in the hotel, we walked everywhere in the downtown area as the car was not needed because if you need to park in downtown then you need to buy meter parking, and plus its hard to find parking in downtown even at breakfast time.

<Title>“Weekend getaway”
<Content>My wife and I went to the Manchester Grand Hyatt for a weekend getaway to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was a super stay. All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The associate at reception placed us in a special room and sent up a personal note along with a bottle of wine and cheese tray. The location is excellent and the facility is special.

<Title>“high curb-appeal with good prox to convention ctr”
<Content>There are better boutique hotels in the area for similar prices, but this location (near convention ctr) was good and the views were fantastic. They put all their design skills into overdecorating the lobby. The rooms were quite clean when we arrived, but nothing special in decor. There's tiny card in the corner of the bathroom that suggests calling the front desk if new linens and room cleaning are needed during your stay. Empty room refrigerators are a plus with a grocery store nearby. Good coffee available by 6am, but the food/service was overrated and overpriced. Good concierge service if you get the right lady. I'd recommend walking into town for meals.

<Title>“Excellent Hyatt Hotel”
<Content>We stayed here for the second time over the Thanksgiving holiday for four nights. Check-in was a breeze with a very nice professional young women assisting us. Our room was on the club level 37th floor with a spectacular view of San Diego Bay. The room was clean and everything worked except one of the lights in the bathroom. Called housekeeping and in ten minutes that light was replaced. No other issues with the room. The Club Room was not available for the first three days due to remodeling on the 32nd floor, so the hotel comped us breakfast in the buffet breakfast restaurant - normally $24 per person. They also gave us $20 credit per day that we could use for anything we choose with respect to food and drinks. Fair compensation and the Club Room opened again on Friday night. I found all the employees I interacted with to be very friendly and professional, especially in the buffet restaurant and the valet service. When I needed my rental car it appeared in just a few minutes from the garage. Yesterday I called the valet to request the car at 10 AM and it was ready and waiting for me. Is is worth $36 dollars a day, no probably not, but with a bum hip that will need replacement soon it was worth it to me. This is a very nice Grand Hyatt in a great location and we would have no reservation staying here again in the future.

<Content>Stayed here for 3 days, the hotel is very nice, the staff were helpful. The rooms were nice and the view was amazing! The location is right next to the ocean and the walkway, it's but a short walk to the Midway aircraft carrier museum, a very affordable tour and highly recommended. All in all I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>A sweeping property with prime location in San Diego, including beautiful views of the bay, an enormous gym and plenty of eating options throughout the property. Their service was exceptional from reservation to departure, making me feel like a valued customer at every brand touch point. And, the beds in this hotel are extremely comfortable rivaling Westin's heavenly beds.

<Title>“Convention hotel with a little more.”
<Content>This is an enormous hotel in an excellent location near significant tourist and entertainment opportunities. We stayed several days recently for a seminar and had several opportunities for using hotel services and restaurants and bars. First, a special shout to hotel concierge Phillip, who was never in a hurry, always happy to help, and a great resource dining and interesting things to do. What a difference friendly staff make. And I must say, all the staff we interacted with were cheery and helpful. Even the lobby sports bar provides good atmosphere and excellent service and food. Our room was fine, though this well used hotel is in need of some updating in the guest rooms and floors. In short, I wouldn't hesitate to book at this hotel directly or through any booking service.

<Content>Tagged along to watch our two year old while the misses did work stuff at a convention. Great location, lots to do, prices pretty high within the hotel, but we don't travel much and spent a few bucks, such as the buffet. Good, not the greatest. Friendly wait staff though. I'd stay here again, but I'd probably stay somewhere else as well---just a lot of places, competition.

<Title>“Ringing in the New Year”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hyatt on New Years Eve 2011. We had stayed once before and we absolutely loved it, so we decided to ring in the New Year there. We found out that the hotel has a New Year's Bash on their top floor for around $100 a person. We hadn't reserved our tickets so we missed out on the party but we found out the hotel's downstairs lounge has one as well. And it was free. They played great music. They also serve dinner or appetizers if you arrive early enough to score a table. We ended up there and we had a wonderful time. We ended up getting engaged that night! It was a great night! We love it so much that we'll be ringing in 2012 at the Hyatt again this year :) The hotel staff is wonderful, and the hotel lobby is very nice. Check in and check out was hassle free. The view from our room was amazing. They have a very nice pool which we haven't been able to use because we always stay in January. They have a fire pit which you can enjoy a nice bottle of wine at. The hotel is walking distance to the downtown bars and shops. We love the Manchester Hyatt! It's one of our favorite places to stay in the gas-lamp district.

<Title>“Would not overpay to stay”
<Content>The hotel from appearance looks high end but do not be fooled. Even though located in a relatively ideal location between the harbor and gaslamp district, the hotel is less than desirable. The walls are paper thin and you can literally hear the conversation next door, same applies to the walls in the bathrooms. The staff is less than lukewarm but are somewhat accommodative and “professional”. Everything when it comes to beverages and room service for food is way overpriced and do not offer good selection. I would avoid staying here if comparable rates are available elsewhere otherwise bring your earplugs and your own food. One positive is great views of the harbor is able to get that room

<Title>“Pleasant stay, great location.”
<Content>I was blown away when I first walked into the hotel. It's quite an amazing common area.. The front desk was very friendly and helpful. The check-in process was hassle-free and quick. I had a single-king room in the Harbor Tower. It was a good sized room with a nice view of the harbor. The accommodations were nice & comfortable, albeit slightly tired/dated. The bed & pillows were comfortable enough for me to fall asleep within minutes of putting my head to the pillow. As previously mentioned, the bathroom was pretty average. Other: Fitness facility is great. Probably the best I've ever seen at a hotel. Plenty of common area to hang out at. Ann Marie's coffee house (detached) is a nice amenity and I loved sitting by the harbor in the morning. Breakfast buffet at Lael's was delicious and the service was excellent.

The staff were all very hospitable, the location excellent for walking to shops/restaurants at Seaport Village and all around the Gaslamp Quarter. The bar at the Top of the Hyatt (40th floor) had amazing views and a nice atmosphere. The breakfast buffet at the hotel was excellent, too!

<Content>Stayed here only one night for my US trip. First time in San Diego from too many hours on the plane and a short drive from LA. Hotel was ok for Grand Hyatt but not superb, with a nice location. It's very closed to Gaslamp. The lobby was pretty with lots of people. The parking is pretty steep. Didn't eat here or use any amenities so couldn't comment on that. Had a nice stay but nothing memorable.

<Content>Attended the Digital Pathology Association - Pathology Visions annual meeting in San Diego 10/30/11 - 11/2/11. The Manchester Grand was a superb place to stay, great place to atten a meeting and right in the heart of downtown San Diego. Short walks to dining, entertainment and shopping. Best of all was the service provided and the ATTITUDE of the hotel employees. Everyone I interacted with was more than helpful and always friendly. The Hotel itself was gorgeous with very nice standard rooms. The 40th floor bar was a great place to end the day and the Kobe beef hotdog in the sportsbar was really good. I will not hesitate to stay at this location again. 5 stars for overal experience.

<Title>“Perfect long weekend vacation!”
<Content>With our daughter attending SDSU we usually stay in Mission Valley when we visit but my wife got a great price on the Hyatt and thought we would give it a try. When we arrived on Oct. 27th we were given a 28 floor room with a great view of the Seaport area. Couldn't have asked for anything better! The room itself was pretty average but didn't feel like it was out of date like many people have posted. The location is the biggest plus, the Seaport area is great and your within walking distance to everything including many shops and restaurants. It's also a great place for a long walk with your morning coffee. Self parking is $26. a day but you expect that in any downtown city hotel. We plan to stay here again on our next visit, it makes for a great long weekend getaway.

<Title>“Superb location, dated rooms”
<Content>We live in San Diego and often decide to get away for a night in the city. This place is walking distance to all the Gaslamp attractions but features dull, dated rooms not worth going back for. The check-in process was super-easy and the rep at the front desk was more than pleasant. We went to the room and had to request a room change because the bathroom was not pleasant. The front desk immediately sent someone up to escort us to another room. Very much appreciated! We then went to the restaurant at the top of the hotel. Someone seated us but no one bothered to check on us to see what we wanted to drink or eat. The place was not crowded and there was staff running around, but we must have been invisible. We just left and went to the lobby bar and had great service. Choose your bar wisely. Overall, great access to the convention center and Gaslamp, but the accommodations are old for a place with 'Grand' in the name.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>I love this hotel, location wise you cant beat it. Located near downtown san diego or better known as the "gaslamp district", walking distance to the convention center and Petco park. Trolley is there and the its bay front great place for 4th of july to watch fireworks. Top of the Hyatt is their roof top bar (top floor and yes its enclosed). Great place to grab a glass a wine or two with a excellent nighttime view of San Diego. check in was a breeze. staff is ready to help and have never had any problem with them. Rooms are great I would say almost all rooms have views of downtown or the bay or even the Coronado bridge. The pool is on the smaller size considering how big this twin tower beast of a hotel is. The hotel is next to "seaport village" a bayside shopping village of shops and eateries from here your close to the floating museum USS Midway and other maritime ships. Again love the location I cant see how anyone would walk away from this place unhappy.

<Content>We stayed two nights at the Manchester Grand October 28 and 29. This is a huge convention hotel with 1600 rooms. The staff was great and check in was easy. I had Pricelined this room and asked for a water view and a king bed instead of a city view and two beds. They happily did that and I had a great view of Coronado Bay. The location is excellent. Beds are fine though nothing exceptional. Bar was good on the first floor. I would stay here again. Valet parking was ridiculous at $36 per day.

<Title>“Top of the Hyatt!”
<Content>This beautiful hotel is located along San Diego bay adjacent to the bustling Gaslamp Quarter and a 1/4 mile form the convention center. The hotel is surprisingly inexpensive (less than $200/nite) compared with the Mariott next door! The hotel is beautiful and very popular with visitors and locals alike. The location can't be beat for the gaslamp nightlife and alot of well dressed younger people will stay here and venture out. The hotel also has a nice spa for your better half to enjoy and 2 outdoor pools and jacuzzi's with a view of the bay. The Top of the Hyatt cocktail lounge located on the 40th floor in one of the two twin towers should not be missed for the view and socializing.

<Title>“Glad to hear you are remodeling!”
<Content>This is the third time I have stayed here and all three times was only because I was working a convention for our company. This is the second time I found SO MUCH haid (from the previous guest) on the bathroom floor and in the bathtub. How gross is that? I guess sweeping bathroom floors isn't on the checklist for housekeeping. My friend said she could hear the guy in the room next door going go the bathroom. Housekeeping was in the room next to mine one night around 10 pm and she was making so much noise that I could hear through the walls.so I hope when they remodel, they add some type of insulation in the walls. Food prices in restaurants are ridiculous! I saw one review that said he got a AAA discount on the buffet breakfast. Wish I had known that. If that's true, they should note that on the menu. I wouldn't stay here unless someone else(as in my company) were footing the bill.

<Title>“Perfect location, great stay, in the heart of it all”
<Content>My sister and I came for a getaway and stayed at this beautiful hotel. So convenient. Staff was courteous and we were treated very well during out stay. We used the spa and had a great experience there, I highly recommend it! Our room faced Coronado and Seaport Village and was just a gorgeous view, especially at night. The room was a bit on the small side but probably average for a hotel room in the city, very well appointed, and I always appreciate decent water pressure when you're on the 31st floor! We stayed 5 nights and received complimentary wi-fi which was sincerely appreciated. The big bonus of this hotel is location. We wanted to see as much as we could during our stay. Within walking distance is the heart of the Gaslamp District, USS Midway, Broadway Pier, Seaport Village, the trolley tour, bus stop, convention center, Petco Park. It was great to walk along the paths close to the hotel and have so many attractions close by. Hint: if you're going to La Jolla - skip the $100 taxi cab roundtrip and take the city bus for $5 during the weekend. Bus is lightly traveled and the route seemed to be very safe. At the Hyatt, we had appetizers at Redfield's which was okay. Was as expected. We also ate at Sally's and while it was not outstanding, it had a great vibe, staff was attentive and had a nice menu. The business center came in handy several times to print out trolley tickets, bus routes, etc. Extended hours would also be helpful. The kiosks were also nice in other locations of the hotel to print out boarding passes. And another perk, considering the number of rooms at the hotel and being on one of the top floors, we hardly had to wait at all for an elevator and they were very fast. Kudos to the hotel for the that! Also the frig in the room was an added bonus, especially for an extended stay. Next time I come back to San Diego I would definitely stay here. Our rate was comparable to similar hotels but I would say the location and the amenities and vibe give the Hyatt the edge. Thanks for a great stay!

<Content>I was utterly impressed with this hotel overall and highly recommend it for any traveler. FYI for business travelers, they have hard to find rates, especially for downtown San Diego. That was its first bonus point for me. I could not find rates like this at the Marriott, Hilton, or any other downtown hotel. I was told these rates are guaranteed at ANY Hyatt. Good to know. Secondly, the rooms are sparkling clean, the beds are comfortable, the view was spectacular, I had no problems with the bathroom (everything worked fine for me), and I slept like a baby. Although I did not manage to get to the pools, there are two, and there are also two hot tubs - both with amazing views of the bay. There's also a fire pit on level four, between the hot tubs, which is nice to sit at in the evening. The gym looked amazing and had numerous treadmills, stairmasters, ellipticals, free weights, and machines. I was very impressed with the staff, all of whom were friendly and accomodating. Upon arrival in my room (after a long day of travel), I found that it smelled like smoke. When I called the front desk, I was immediately given another room with no problem. The second room was much better, and the staff called me to double check it was okay. Check out was painless and quick. The location cannot be beat. The Manchester Grand Hyatt is seated at the bottom of downtown right next to Seaport Village. In fact, if you go out the back door of the hotel, you can immediately enter Seaport Village. You can easily walk to a number of popular areas in downtown. The hotel is only four blocks from the Gaslamp district and the USS Midway and 10 blocks from Little Italy and Petco Park. Because of this proximity, you have easy access to numerous restaurants, bars, and attractions. There is an attached parking garage, which is also useful. It's very easy to get in and out of the garage, and the entrance to Interstate 5 is only 5-7 minutes away, depending on traffic. I did take the opportunity to dine at both Sally's on the Water and the sports bar downstairs (Redfield's). The food was wonderful, but FYI, the prices are a little steep. Most of the time, my colleagues and I went out to eat. As there are many options in the immediate area, this was not a problem. I will definitely be coming back to this hotel in the future!

<Title>“I beg of you...don't stay at this hotel.”
<Content>As a long time leisure and business traveler, this was by far one of the most disappointing experiences I've ever had at a hotel. I will never, ever stay here again. After moving rooms the first night (because my first room was considered new in 1970 and even had a 1970 smell to go with it), I forgot my jewelry pouch in the first room. Less than 3 hours later, my pouch was returned by security with my (fake) diamond necklace and gold earrings missing. I reported it to 5 different staff members, had to repeat my story 5 times; at one point, a manager accused me of making up this story, "am I sure I packed these items?" Yes, I do remember what I pack, and as a 7+ year business traveler, you got me--I love to lie about stolen jewelry--not. They said they would do an 'internal investigation,' whatever that means. Everything is overpriced. Valet parking=$36.00/day. Room service has a limited menu and expensive: 21% service charge and $3.50 delivery charge. Breakfast buffet; if it were not for our AAA rate, it would have been $30.00/per person. Minus a few professional members of the staff, most here are unprofessional, insincere, and just don't really care about your experience. One night we ordered room service, and the staff member told us as he left our room to "call down as soon as we were done because they were low on tables." Um, what? We have to rush through our meal because this hotel does not have an adequate supply of service tables? Unfortunately, this hotel takes advantage of conferences that are held here and the attendees of them. Please consider another hotel near the area; there are many options within walking distance, and you won't feel violated at the end of the day.

<Title>“Great location, needs a remodel!”
<Content>Downtown San Diego is a great place to vacation. And if you like to be able to walk around but still like to see the water, the Manchester Grand is a fabulous location! The hotel is just a few blocks from bustling downtown and you can walk less than a block and be at the water. The Manchester Grand is an enormous hotel with a couple of towers so it loses any sense of intimacy. But the most disappointing part was the rooms themselves. They were definitely in need of a massive makeover. The bathrooms looked like something out of the 70's and in fact the bathroom floods a bit when the shower is on. However, the rooms tend to be fairly inexpensive (compared to other hotels in the Gaslamp) so, if you don't plan to spend much time inside, it's not a bad option.

<Title>“Great services, elfish beds”
<Content>wow, talk about this place being the anti family hotel. When you book a double bed room you get yes, two double beds... two FULL size beds. You know the ones that you buy for your eight year old that he/she outgrows by high school. Needless to say, if mom and dad want to sleep in the same bed, good luck sleeping. We ended up sleeping for about 4 hours that night squarely because we could not get in a comfortable position without having to reach for the floor. I can't complain about the rest of the hotel, it is an amazing hotel, and even though some of the rooms decor seems dated, its still clean and well kept. To me, the one issue that the hotel should never have is a bed that will give you a hard time to fall asleep. So if you are getting two double beds and there are more than two people in your party. Good luck!

<Title>“Really has turned into a convention hotel!”
<Content>Outside of the concierge experience, Philip Kaufman is a wonder, I must say that I felt a bit disappointed by the experience. I had trouble getting the accommodations we were promised and there was a great deal of confusion, at the front desk, during the first 24 hours of our stay. While the management did endeavor to make things right and gave us some lovely amenities, I felt that their focus on convention guests far outweighed their concern with this "lifetime Diamond" member.

<Title>“Excellent hotel and convention location”
<Content>Stayed here for an annual convention, and my experience was outstanding. Check in was very prompt with a courteous staff. Room was ready and we went directly there. Room decor is outstanding and well appointed. View over the water - breath-taking. Bathroom was well stocked and with plenty of room. Elevators move quickly going and coming. Housekeeping did a great job and never messed with my stuff. HVAC system worked well and kept the room very comfortable. Bed was very comfortable. Work area within the room was well organized and plenty of AC outlets. Have to pay for internet, which I think stinks, so I just tether from my cell phoen and save the money. Convention space is large and well labeled. Several restaurants on-site, and lots of places withing walking distance. Hotel was a little pricey, but the facility is beautiful, you have great views, close to the water, and the hotel staff are excellent. Would stay here again no question.

<Title>“Great Hotel for Convention”
<Content>I attended a convention at this Hotel and I wish the annual convention was here every year rather switching to different Hotels. The service at the Hotel is great. It is easy to get to to Hotel from airport. If you want to go offsite to any restaurants or bars they are in easy walking distance in Gaslamp District. The room I was in had a great view of the Harbor. The food at all the convention functions was very good. The staff knew how to handle a large convention.

<Title>“The view is worth your time”
<Content>The rooms themselves, at least the doubles, are not much to write home about. Go in expecting the standard hotel room. What you are really paying for is the fantastic view, the location, and the outstanding service. The view from our room, 1351, was amazing. My family and friend and I just stood in front of the floor to ceiling window looking at the bay. Also the hotel is right across the street from the trolley and there are taxis waiting down by the entryway. One tip about the trolley service- don’t buy the all day ticket if you are just going a stop or two from the hotel. We made that mistake only to find out that the conductors never check them. The Hyatt is also walking distance from the marina, Seaport Village, and the Gaslamp Quarter. We were also able to rent a car for a day trip to Los Angeles. We originally made reservations with another rental company in town but fortunately found out when we got to the hotel that they have a Hertz onsite. It was a quick and easy transaction. We were even able to give our keys to the hotel concierge desk late that night instead of having to get up early and give it to Hertz. The staff is friendly and extremely helpful. They gave great recommendations (try Richard Walker's Pancake House and Cafe 222!) and even mailed our postcards for us. The lobby has a cool old Hollywood feel and the outside is gorgeous. I definitely recommend this hotel.

In Feb we tried another high end chain hotel and this Sept we immediately went back to the Hyatt after being so disappointed in the other hotel. track the prices and you can get a great deal.

<Title>“Disappointing and sub-par”
<Content>Stayed here for a wedding weekend and was very disappointed with the disconnect between the quality of the public spaces and the guest rooms. The lobby and conference/wedding facilities were beautiful. The pool area was fun (though insanely overpriced). The only good thing about the room was the view (and it was stellar). All of the furniture was outdated and in real need of replacement; much of it was also banged up. The tube TV was small and had to be a decade old. The rug had stains. The linens reminded me of the quality you'd expect at a Days Inn. The bathroom was small and dark. It's a massive hotel and I'm sure it takes years to renovate the rooms & get new furniture in, but ultimately a hotel is a place to sleep and it ought to keep up.

<Title>“Very large, nice urban hotel in good downtown location.”
<Content>We stayed here for my spouse's business conference. Arrived early in the day (prior to official check in time) and were given a corner room with a great view. Double room was quite spacious and comfortable. Service was very attentive - when I couldn't get hot water in our bathroom, they sent someone within 10 minutes and fixed the problem immediately. Didn't eat any meals at hotel so can't say much; however, convenience store/bakery in lobby had some yummy breakfast treats and good coffee (Starbucks). Hotel is a 15 minute ride by taxi to airport (about $15). Also right at light rail station. Easy walk to Gas Lamp District, Horton Plaza, waterfront and ferry to Coronado.

<Title>“Theft of service, dignity and all my future business”
<Content>DO NOT STAY HERE! If you do - check, re-check, then check your bill again. They stole an extra night's room stay by overcharging our account. AND THEY HAVE DRAGGED THEIR HEELS IN PROVIDING REIMBURSEMENT. Nearly three months later, this has still not been resolved. We were allocated the Hyatt through the ComicCon hotel allocation through Travel Planners. In this transaction, TP charged one night's stay (in May '11) When we checked in, the check-in desk representative found the reservation and assured us that all was well. When we checked out, we found our bill was several hundred dollars higher than expected. We questioned this with the first desk representative found no record of the first night as having been paid. When we pressed, a manager was called in. She also found no record. I then provided my paid receipt from Travel Planners. She said that that was not proof - I would need to provide a copy of my bank transaction to prove that it had been paid. WTF??? Without that said proof, the Hyatt would not refund. Returning home, we immediately contacted Travel Planners and started the appeal process. Several emails and phone calls ensued. TP provided all the required financial transactions, showing that we had indeed paid for our hotel stay. Come to find out, there were likely hundreds of Comic Con customers who had been overcharged by the Hyatt due to their inept bookkeeping. All the funds had been sent from Travel Planners but somehow, they had gone missing on the Hyatt's end. No apologies offered from the Hyatt. None whatsoever. What abysmal customer service. The Hyatt came up with an absolutely idiotic solution - they would provide reimbursement to Travel Planners and told Travel Planners that it would then be their responsibility to provide our reimbursement. Again... WTF??? So, it's now October and no $$$ have been returned. I am giving it until the end of this week before starting THEFT litigation. As for the facility, the only good thing is the location - central to a lot of attractions. For a high quality hotel, the cleanliness was sorely lacking. Room service trays we had dodge upon leaving our room in the morning were still there (and reeking) when we returned in the evening. Bed coverings had some pretty funky smells. DO NOT STAY HERE!

<Title>“Grand Indeed”
<Content>We stayed here quite a few times on business, and I must say that I was quite impressed with this hotel. From the front entrance to the hotel to the spacious ultra high ceilings in the lobby, everything here says grand. The surrounding property is filled with world class eateries, and the lobby has a small mall like shopping area. A mile or two in any direction provides a great place to take a morning run or an evening stroll. The BBQ joint across the street is the place where they filmed "Top Gun". There is also a fire pit area near the pool which is really cool, and the gym/fitness area is like a mini Gold's Gym. We always are given rooms on the middle to upper floors, and the views are always awesome. Although I have only stayed here on business trips, I would definitely bring my family to this great hotel.

<Title>“Great stay, but I had higher expectations”
<Content>I thought for a hotel which cost >$200/night it had to have extreme luxury all around. I didn't feel like i was in that hotel all the time. There was not free internet service to my knowledge, but service hook ups were in the room. i also didn't get a free breakfast with my stay. The service at night is not nearly what it is in the morning. The best part of the stay was the view of the Seaport Village and San Diego Bay. The property is not crowded and the club "Top of the Hyatt" is a real classy place. The pool deck and spa areas are tops for the city. The worst part of my stay was when I walked 10 blocks to get my car because i was too buzzed to drive home and I came back to valet my car. I was told that i needed to pay $25 for the 3 hours it was parked there.

<Content>Yes, it's a very big hotel and full of business travelers but the pros outweighed the cons. The pools are great especially the adult one on the 3 rd floor. The 4th floor main pool gets a little cool due to the breeze. Great views from both. Check out the Top of the Hyatt... great bar and fantastic views of the harbor. So many places to eat nearby and the it's worth walking into town to get away from the hotel restaurants which were expensive and busy. Rooms were clean but dated and walls are a little thin. Great views from the higher floors over the bay. Keep the window closed if you don't want to be woken up by the train!

<Content>We recently spent 5 days at the Manchester Hyatt on a family vacation. This hotel is very nice and the rooms are clean & pretty typical of what you would expect in an hotel room. The only problem we had was water from neighbors backing up in bathroom sink--notified staff upon check out. The location is great and you and walk to so many eating & shopping locations. Old Town Trolley picks up at Seaport Village which is just beside the hotel. I would recommend the extra $$ for a bay view--it was amazing. This hotel helped make our San Diego vacation amazing! We also paid the extra $25 for early check in and was able to check in just after 10am.

<Content>In the short week I spent in Downtown San Diego was a unique experience I definitely would have to go again, maybe even with my own money. It started at the hotel we stayed at, The Grand Hyatt. The rooms were okay. But the meeting places and surrounding locations were excellent. Plenty to do from night life to watching the boats along the harbor. The hyatt also has a 40th floor restaurant that overlooks the whole place. Spectacular view! Plus San Diego is great anyway so I dunno..

<Content>The hotel is located near the convention center and right across the street from Sea Port Village and close to the gas lamp district. The hotel room itself was nice, rooms were large, clean and comfortable. One thing I did not like about the room is the vanity is in the bathroom which when you are traveling with others makes it difficult to get ready. My room had a beautiful view of the ocean and the USS Midway. Many wonderful restaurants within walking distance and a complementary fitness center which was large and clean. The only negative was at check in my room wasn't ready until around 5 p.m. I had wanted to freshen up before my meeting but didn't really have time.

The location is perfect, walking distance to the gas lamp district and sea port village, lots to see and do and eat! The rooms need updating for the price. It's a $12-14 cab ride to the airport. Room service was quick and tasty, as with check in, checking out was also quick and easy. The public washrooms were smelly even though freshly cleaned?

<Title>“Excellence in Customer Service - Outstanding for Accomodations”
<Content>Let me start out by saying thank you to everyone at Grand Hyatt Manchester in San Diego! I was there for the ASBDC Conference the first week in September. This is an annual conference, and I have attended every one for the last several years. In addition I attend several other conferences during each year. It was my first visit to San Diego. By far and hands down, Grand Hyatt Manchester in San Diego was the best conference location I have ever been to. The best hotel I have ever stayed out too. You Rock! YOu will not find a better view in San Diego. RIght on the harbor, so close to everything. I had so much fun watching the ships come in and out. This lovely Midway aircraft carrier, Vincent and Regan ships were visible from my room. Fantastic. Just a hoip, skip and jump to the harbor and marina. Two pools, one strictly for adults. So nice to lay by the pool where it is quiet and read. What made it so great, the fantastic staff? From the day we made our first phone call to the reservation desk, to the day I received our invoice. I was treated with utmost care. You really know what customer service is. You could be a national example of best practices in the hotel industry. A special personal thanks go out to the staff, you truly know what customer service excellence really is. Please extend my thanks to your entire team. I hope to return again someday. There is nothing I would change. Heck, I didn't want to leave, and I love your city! I was so spoiled, and I love it....

<Title>“Great location BUT...”
<Content>We stayed here for 4 nights because we had some Hyatt certificates to use. I definitely wouldn't pay what they charge for this place. And the $26/day for parking is outrageous. My initial impression was "Wow! This place is so nice!" The lobby is very grand and the location is awesome, walking distance to the Gaslamp, downtown, Petco Park. The room itself was fine. We stayed on the 29th floor and had a nice view of the water and Seaport Village. We had a fridge and a safe. They brought us a pack n play for our daughter to sleep in because we forgot to bring ours. Well, come 9 pm when we put the little one to bed and we hear the trains. Even on the 29th floor they are LOUD and ANNOYING. Luckily the little one slept through it but it was pretty ridiculous. Also, the bed wasn't that comfortable. It was a bit saggy and not great on the back.

<Title>“Good Location”
<Content>As many of you have already said, this hotel is in a great location. The entrance and lobby are beautiful and you step out the back door right into Seaport Village with shops, restaurants, etc. We booked a Corner King Suite and were given Room 1152 in the Seaport Tower. Our views in the evening were great - we loved them. I will agree with others that these rooms are not "Hyatt" quality. They definitely need updating. I have stayed at other Hyatt hotels and their room furnishings are much nicer and more up to date. Our check-in and check-out were very quick and easy. They have special kiosks to print your boarding pass free of charge, but we were a bit disappointed that you had to pay to use their computers for internet purposes. With the price paid, I think that should be complimentary. The other disappointment was that there were two afternoons, they required you left the 4th floor pool in order for them to accommodate a private party. A guest really doesn't want to hear that after paying what we did. However, I will say they directed you to the 3rd floor pool in the other tower. They do however have comfortable lounge chairs and plenty of towels at both pools. Again, great location, we had a great time in San Diego; however when we return we will probably try the Marriott Marina.

<Content>After reading the previous reviews, I was hesitant to book the Hyatt Manchester over neighboring convention center hotels. I found that the Hyatt Manchester was much better than I expected, and a standard Hyatt experience. The service was very good, especially at the restaurant and the bars. Room was average size with updated furnishings and was clean. Nice views from the rooms near the top of the hotel (I was on the 21st floor). It is worth checking out the 40th floor bar for the amazing views, and I was able to find a AAA discount that gave me free breakfasts. Breakfast is normally $25 and is a high quality buffet with some variation in choices. As mentioned, restaurant service is well above average. Parking is expensive, especially short-term (got charged $21 for 2 hours, but is normally $26 per day). Rooms with a connecting door can be noisy, so avoid if possible. Otherwise I was very satisfied. The hotel is located in a harbor area that is nice for an evening walk, but a bit of a tourist trap. For a day excursion rent a car at the hotel Hertz for a day (about $60 on the weekend) and head out to La Jolla cove to hang out at the beach, shop in La Jolla, and rent a Kayak.

<Title>“Reserve at your own Peril”
<Content>I am Hyatt platinum passport member, twice i have had confirmed reservations at his hotel only to be turned away because the hotel was sold out. I have never had this happen at any of the other Hyatt properties i have stayed world wide. Specially disappointing has been the customers service manager's attitude towards the situation, it can be summed up as "i don't care, screw you". Regular staff have way more sensitivity toward customer service than their managers. The customer service manager attitude is a disservice to the effort of the rest of the Hyatt team worldwide. Whenever i stay at another Hyatt property and something does not goes as planned , the manager cares, not here. When i have been able to get a room i have found them outdated and not congruent with the sumptuous lobby and the steep price tag. You would be well off trying other option when in downtown San Diego.

<Title>“Great Location and excellent staff”
<Content>My wife and I booked this hotel for a weekend getaway. It was our first time at this property and the location was perfect. The hotel sits adjacent to Seaport Village, is a short walk from the Gas Lamp, and down the shore from the USS Midway. As we entered the lobby, the marble floors and massive, ornate ceilings were impressive. What impressed us even more, however was the friendliness of the staff. We were greeted promptly, and given a complimentary room upgrade with a harbor view. We were allowed an early check-in as well. The room was spacious and modern with a comfortable bed and huge flat-screen tv. The view was incredible and atmosphere was very relaxing. We would definitely come back to this hotel again.

<Title>“Good location to Gas Lamp Quarter”
<Content>This hotel is located a walk away from the Gas Lamp, great restaurants, and many attractions. The hotel decor could use some updating. We wanted to recognize Philip at the concierge desk. He was extremely helpful and courteous. All his recommendations were terrific. We had a great view of Coronado and the US Naval Base.....We have stayed at many Hyatt hotels and this one could use some updating.

<Title>“Good location to many attraction”
<Content>This hotel is great in proximity to downtown location and attraction. The best is Seaport Village where you can spend the entire day to visit each stores and dine there. Best bay view restaurant is Harbor Restaurant, so don't miss it. They also have kids menu. Attraction can't be missed is the Waterfront cruise from Seal , see photo #1. Hotel itself are pretty old but renovated in guest room. You can tell but is acceptable. If u visit during summer, I would not recommend to rent a car since many attractions could be within walking distance and taxi is cheap. Parking is $28/day at hotel. Didn't try out the food in the hotel but definitely, make good use of the fridge to save cost. There is a supermarket called Ralph about 10 mins walking distance that you can buy roast chicken, hot food as take-out. Buy some milks and cereal as breakfast for kids for the morning. The guest room is not much different than the other one, however, the best part is to view the bay. You must like it... Whether is day or night, you should visit the top 40th floor from Manchester Tower I think (the newer one). It is free which save some money especially for family of 4, it would be easily $60....The floor is open to public after 3pm daily but requires to be 18 after 8pm...See photos. Staffs are not excited & not that friendly, no smile, perhaps it is due to the wage, or too busy, etc....

<Title>“Great job under adverse conditions!”
<Content>While attending national conference at this hotel, the region was suddenly without electricity. In San Diego this power outage lasted eight hours. The hotel management did a wonderful job keeping guests informed as to the nature of the problem, its size and probable length. They kept elevators running, lights on in the hallways and bars and restaurants well-stocked (most important because the blackout was from 4 pm to midnight.) Staff were very helpful. What could have been a major pain for many guests ended up as more of a minor blip, mainly because the hotel was prepared and management was on top of everything! Nice job!

<Content>While the rooms aren't as beautiful as the lobby (and when did lobbies stop providing places to sit down while your party registers and checks out?), this is a nice hotel in a great location. Walking distance to the harbor boat tours, Gaslamp District. Next to Seaport Village, with shopping, food and entertainment. We were there in a blackout and the hotel staff were awesome! Five stars for Philip, one of the concierges. He found us great deals, great dinners, a great time.

<Content>Hyatt hotels are overall fantastic, and this property is no exception. But if you are a light or early sleeper, this may not be the right location for you. Freight trains seem to come by every night around midnight. Trolleys, trains and noise from the street can be heard even at higher floors.

Located right near all the downtown San Diego attractions and The Gas Lamp district.. San Diego Convention Center next door, Petco Park a short walk away and did I mention The Gas Lamp District a few steps away? Complete access to restaurants, museums and San Diego's nightlife..

<Title>“Fantastic place to stay in a perfect location!!!”
<Content>First time in San Diego and this hotel was great. On the harbour front, near to the Fish Market restaurant, and within walking distance of the Gas Lamp district where there is a wide choice of restaurants and bars, as well as shops. We were on the 30th floor with an awesome view of the harbour and with the baseball ground Petco park in the distance. The trolley (tram system) ran from just over the road which was convenient for getting to Sea World and Fashion Valley (not my choice of venues but I'm a good bag carrier). The hotel room was spacious, big bed, very comfy, all clean, and the 40th floor 'Top of the Hyatt' was a good place to kick the night off, or retire to mid afternoon to escape the heat. The restaurant in the hotel is nice, as are the bars, but I would recommend getting out to the local restaurants, as there are some great fish places to eat, and the steak at the Marble Room in the Gas Lamp was fantastic. We will definitely return to San Diego and this hotel soon! ...and a quick word on San Diego, it is right up there with our favourite place New York, as the people are very friendly and we loved it!!!.

<Title>“THE BEST OF EVERYTHING”
<Content>At our recent stay at the Manchester Hyatt we found the quality of service unsurpassed, starting with the concierge, specifically Philip and Mercedes, always doing their best to make our stay enjoyable. Cathy, and Benazon went out of their way, along with Ben our bellman to help us find a certain type of medicine for my wife and myself, even personally driving us there. Basel was also one of the most helpful managers we have met. We are frequent travelers to San Diego, and we never consider any other hotel than the Manchester Hyatt. The staff are more friendly and welcoming than anywhere we've ever been; we always feel like we're home when we arrive.

<Title>“Beautiful hotel, great location!”
<Content>We are from San Diego and have always loved downtown! The Manchester is in a great location right on the bay, next to Seaport Village and very close to restaurants and fun things to do downtown. We enjoyed our stay very much. The staff is very accommodating, hotel lobby is beautiful, gym is very nice, pool overlooks the water. We stayed in the older tower, and the room, while clean and comfortable, was in need of some updates. Mainly the bathroom. This hotel could be very close to 5 stars (most of it is) except for the updating needed in the rooms. This did not affect our stay at all, but I know some people who read these reviews want to know all the details. :-) My husband and I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.

<Title>“A room with a view”
<Content>The rooms in this hotel (at least the doubles) are nothing special. Except that the view from our window was amazing. We could see the city, the water, and the pool. It was gorgeous. That said, the room itself was rather bland. It was clean though, and equipped with a refrigerator and a safe. The bathroom was a nice size, but again, nothing special. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful (though the cleaning staff once forgot to give us any towels- they remedied it once we called to complain, but it happened), they were always ready with maps, restaurant suggestions and coupons, which made our stay very pleasant. The lobby was grand and almost as pretty as the view. The hotel doesn't offer a complementary breakfast, but there are two wonderful breakfast restaurant in an easy walk so that wasn't much trouble. I highly recommend Richard Walker's Pancake House and Cafe 222 (the hotel staff will give you directions). The hotel is very centrally located. It's in easy walking distance to Seaside Village, the Gaslamp Quarter, and the trolley. That was one of the best aspects of the hotel. We also rented a car through the hotel (Hertz) and it was a very simple and quick transaction.

<Title>“Great location, nice view.”
<Content>Stayed for four nights - nice hotel, awesome location - right on the water, beside San Diego's Seaport Village. However - the room is just a room. The view was beautiful - we paid extra for a "premium view" room, and it was nice - but not sure we would do that again. There are no balconies, so you cannot fully enjoy the seaside experience anyway. I would definitely request a room overlooking the Coronado Bridge side next time - our room faced the other side, 24th floor. "Wireless" internet service is spotty - so if it is important to you to have a good reliable connection, request a room close to the "antenna" (I cannot stress this enough if you need a connection) - we had to move after the first night, as the signal in our room (about halfway down the hall) was very poor. Internet service is not free (which is ridiculous - the more expensive the hotel, the less services they provide cost-free!!) - but if you sign up for a Hyatt Gold Passport, which IS free, you get complimentary internet - so sign up on check-in and your internet will cost you nothing (thanks to the front desk clerk who told me about that!). Room was clean, but nothing special. Bed was very comfortable and we slept well. Desk chair was worn out in the first room - actually time for re-upholstery or the dumpster, in my opinion! Once again - it is JUST a room. Nothing special. You are paying for the location - EASY walking distance to Gaslamp quarter (5-10 minutes) and Petco Park (10-15 minutes for Padres game), and the view - that's it. Coffee maker and fridge in room. Breakfast buffett in Lael's is awesome, but expensive - $24 per person, including coffee and juice - and they will offer you coffee to go as well when you leave. Service is incredible, so if you rise late and this is your breakfast AND lunch it is likely worth the price. There are good deals with respect to rates on the internet - make sure you look at all the options when booking on the hotel's own site. Hotel is pet friendly. Lots of dogs around! Watch your invoice on check-out - there were charges on ours' that should not have been there. Front desk clerk was very accommodating with correcting the errors. All staff we encountered were excelllent - very helpful and accommodating. Also important to note - excellent elevator service - despite being a highrise hotel, there are lots of elevators and they are assigned to certain floors - unusually fast.

<Title>“great location”
<Content>My husband and I had just moved from Northern to the Southern California region. Usually we go away on a tropical vacation for our anniversary, but because we had just moved and I had not gotton a job yet; it was not possible. At the last minute I booked a trip to San Diego...which is about 1 1/2 hours from where we stay. The Manchester Grand Hyatt had a great sale on rooms and after reading some of the reviews on trip advisor and YELP we decided to give it a try. The check in process was effortless. After the front desk clerk learned that it was our 10th anniversary, they upgraded us to a higher floor, corner room with a great view of the harbor. The room was a little dated , but nice. The bathtub was chipped and after sharing with the manager at the end of our stay, they discounted our rooom. The bed was very comfortable and hard to get out of in the morning. The next time we come, we will ask to stay in the newer tower. The front desk person also provided us with complimentary breakfast buffet for our entire stay and sent up a bottle of wine and chocolate truffles. The breakfast was good, but repetitious. Every morning they had the same selections with the exception of one entree. The wait staff was very attentive and personable. The hotel is centrally located. We walked to the gas lamp district. It took us 10 minutes to drive to the zoo. The ferry over to Coronado Island is right next to the hotel and so is Shoreline Village. Because is was our anniversary we booked a couples massage in the spa. The massage was good, but not excellent and way over priced! What we did like is that right next to the spa they had an adults only area with a pool and jacuzzi. We ordered food and drinks and spent the rest of that day , as the kids would say...chillaxin. All in all we had a great time and will definitely be back.

<Content>We came to this hotel because of a conference. It is a gorgeous place, very high end and conveniently located in the centre of downtown San Diego. But it is an expensive hotel with no extras. At a cheaper hotel, you could get two nights for the price of one at this place AND rent a car! There is a fridge (barely) but no microwave. Wi-fi which is free all over the city is NOT free here. The room we stayed in did have a great view but it was as small as any other hotel room and a little less clean. No breakfast in the mornings. It's cold and kind of impersonal here...brrrr. Won't do this again.

<Title>“Definitely Would Return!”
<Content>This is a "grand" hotel with a massive lobby, very beautiful. The rooms are nice, but in San Diego you don't want to spend much time in your room. They have a great pool area and my favorite is the fire pits.... our group did a Smores roast and gain 10 lbs! The staff was good. Food at the hotel is pricey, so we walked a couple of blocks to the Ralphs market and they had an amazing selection of hot and cold foods. The room had a frig so I took yogurt for breakfast, but the breakfast buffet is famous so one morning I splurged and added another 10 lbs! Parking is costly, but it makes sense to have a car even tho' most things you can walk to or take the public transportation.

The next morning more bites for both of us, we need alcohol to stop the itching. We check out and inform them of our concern and they inform of the experts they are bring in to check the room. Of course their expert finds nothing. Get home and the next morning more bites,did the mosquitos follow us home. You tell me what you think it is. My wife is going to see the doc today. One thing for sure we didn't have this problem until we spent the night at this place. What's next.

<Title>“Good business hotel - a little too big for its own good”
<Content>I have stayed at the MGH in San Diego many times on business before, and luckily, I tend to stay there in August as there is an annual convention on in the hotel. After a long transatlantic flight via LAX, I arrived early evening and check-in was swift. Within 5 minutes of pulling up to the hotel in a cab, I was in my room on the 34th floor unpacking my case while taking in the sumptuous views over the harbour and the Coronado bridge. The room was your standard Hyatt-style room complete with king size bed, bathroom and work area. The room was clean, the bed comfy, the TV perfect and the free coffee delicious. The bathroom was of a good size if not a little spartan but I am such a fan of their white ginger shampoo and conditioner that I can forgive them the little things. I stayed four nights in total and had breakfast delivered to my room every morning as I could not face the buffet breakfast that is served in Lael's on the ground floor. Years ago Lael's used to be an a la carte breakfast type place but the powers that be changed it into a buffet one and personally the sight of mounds of pre-cooked bacon, sausage links as well as fruit puts me right off first thing in the morning. Room service was swift but I take exception to the canny way in which a $18 omelette can suddenly morph into a $30 check once service charge, tray charge, gratuities and taxes are loaded onto the bill. And then the server expects you to add a further tip. So here's a tip from me, just be careful when ordering your breakfast on the phone as the agent will upsell you like crazy - or at least try to. There are tons of rooms at this hotel, so now and again it can feel a little impersonal. The gym was in the other tower (the seaport one - I stayed in the harbour tower), so every morning I went for a my little walk down my corridor to the elevator, down to the 4th floor and then across from one tower to the other passing the hotel pool. The gym is very good and most of the cardio machines look out over the harbour towards the navy base. I saw two massive navy ships come in and leave port over the course of the 4 days I was there. The hotel bar is in the harbour tower to the left of the front desk area and again, because of the sheer size of the hotel, it does feel a little impersonal. I had some of my business meetings there both in the daytime and in the evening and the atmosphere lacked a little. It often felt like you were sitting at a bar in a shopping mall with the sheer amount of folks passing by. There is a bar on the top floor of the harbour tower but I gave that a miss this time. All in all, I do enjoy the MGH, and for business trips it certainly ticks all the boxes. However, if you are looking for a little atmosphere and a little more intimacy from a hotel, then go elsewhere in sunny San Diego.

<Title>“I would not recommend this hotel unless your primary reason for staying here is to be walking distance to seaport village.”
<Content>The location is perfect. It's walking distance to seaport village. It's very close to gas lamp quarter. However there are many down sides! It's a rooftop pool and the two buildings creat a wind tunnel. Even in august it was really windy. We didn't get to enjoy the pool. The room is decent but not great. It definitely wad not worth the price. I would not recommend staying here. The grand buffet breakfast was excellent. We had paid for it while booking the room. We still got charged for it everymorning! Had we not noticed it on our bill when we checked out, we would have paid double for breakfast. They don't have many activities for kids. They had movie night on Saturday night but it was so cold that the kids weren't able to stay and watch. And the seats were the pool chairs that had been used all day by hotel guests and so they were wet. They had s'mores but you had to purchase them. We have stayed at many hotels that offer this for free. it's not the cost but the principle of it. After we complained about the room View, which was supposed to be a full harbor view, they gave us $30 credit per night which was like getting parking for free. We were there gor four days and I could say that this was not how we wanted to end our summer vacation. Don't stay here. There are so many beautiful hotels in sam Diego area.

<Title>“good for business or pleasure”
<Content>my boyfriend was there on business.. i met him for a long wknd. the hotel is large, updated and clean. the pool is small and was not crowded at all during our stay in july. the comic-con convention was going on so the lobby and hotel bars were crowded but service was fine. the breakfast buffet in the morning is stocked and has an omelet bar.. tasty. the wait service at the buffet appears to expect standard tipping, which i dont think is necessary for delivering one glass of OJ. the hotel staff at the restaurant and front desk was friendly and the cleaning staff provided plenty of extra towels and shampoos when we requested. the hotel is located near the downtown area.. few blocks walk or there are those bike/taxis that are always nearby too. the gaslamp district is nearby .. la puerta mexican restaurant/bar was delicious.. and there is a shishkebab place on one of the numbered streets that is also good and highly rated by yelp. we took one of the ferries to the nearby mini "island" .. the ferry was a 15 min walk from hotel.. it was a nice quick ride and there are a couple more restaurants on the island.. cant remember the name of it but it was a cute little trip for an afternoon all in all i would stay here again for business or pleasure.

<Title>“I want to go back NOW!”
<Content>Just got back after spending a wonderful week here. Although this was my first visit to San Diego, there could not possibly be a better or more conveniently located hotel in the city. The lobby is absolutely awesome, and I found my room very clean and comfortable. At first I was disappointed that I was given a room on the 4th floor, but then I was pleasantly surprised that the amazing pool deck and super-equipped fitness center are located on this same level. So both were a short walk from my room, and that was perfect for me because I used both every day. Besides, if you want a spectacular view, go up to the lounge on the top floor of the hotel for a drink, you won't want to leave! I got a good deal on my room because I took advantage of the "prepaid" option when I booked it. Although it is nonrefundable, if you are reasonably certain you won't cancel, you can save a lot of money! Horton Plaza, with its myriad of shops and restaurants, as well as the Gaslight District are both within easy walking distance, and Seaport Village is right behind the hotel just steps away. By the way, you can pick up the San Diego Trolley tour there, and I HIGHLY recommend it. The tour is only $34 for the day ($30 if you purchase online) and goes to the best places in San Diego. You can get on and off as many times as you please. Don't miss Coronado Island! The Trolley stops there, as well as Balboa Park, Little Italy, Old Towne, and other great places. If you rent a car, make sure you drive out to Point Loma, which is about 20 minutes away. The views of the San Diego skyline on one side, and the Pacific on the other, are asolutely breathtaking! A couple of things to keep in mind: parking is quite expensive at this hotel, so if you are not going to use your car every day, I suggest you rent it for just the days you plan to use it. Also, I don't understand why in this day and age, so many hotels continue to charge for internet service. It's like charging for tap water. Oh well, that is one of my pet peeves. But when I return to San Diego, I will definitely stay here again and I highly recommend it!

<Title>“Slightly Above Average Hotel - Rooms Need a Facelift”
<Content>I stay at this hotel every August for about 5 days for my national sales conference. I've been doing so since 2006, so I've had a real opportunity to see how it changes from year to year. The location is awesome: steps from the downtown/gaslamp district and only a 5-10 minute drive to the airport. The hotel is also bordering the seaport village area which is real nice and peaceful to walk around and chill. The good parts of the hotel are the 2 pools (if you're over 21 go to the spa pool--its much nicer) the restaurants (Sally's on the water was quite nice) and the lobby bar which is a nice place to meet up with people and have a drink. The views are also very pleasant from the 5th floor and up... right over the water. The only real downside is that the rooms just feel so 1990. The shower is kinda small and average, actually the whole bathroom feels that way and the sink pressure was really weird. The bed was pretty comfortable but the carpeting covering the room was just old looking and not up to snuff with other newer hotels. I stayed in the Harbor Tower, so maybe that was my error but i visited a buddy of mine in the Seaport tower and frankly, it wasn't all that different. Overall a decent place-- I'd stay there if you can get it under $175/night but I wouldn't go much deeper than that.

<Title>“This is Hyatt luxury”
<Content>stayed for ESRI convention, so my pleasure was suplimented by my job paying the bill. But I have stayed here before and it is as good and reliable as it gets. Get south facing Harbor tower. Two pools, one AREA near the spa is adults only with one jacuzi. the family one is large pool two jacuzi and 3 fire pits for the late night marshmellow burning. Movie outside saturdays. Near evrything at this place staff friendly and attentive, and it's worth paying extra for the Grand Club. Open all day reguarless of what the sign says, 6am to 9pm.

<Title>“Superb breakfast buffet, great waterfront location at Seaport Village.”
<Content>We have stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt at least a dozen times in the last few years and have enjoyed every stay. The location of the Hyatt is in the heart of Seaport Village, a fun place to walk right outside the backdoor of the hotel with small shops and tasty treats. The views of the bay from the hotel are panoramic and interesting. Looking south toward the city, Coronado bridge and Mexico; or north toward the military base, the aircraft carrier and cruise ships, and Point Loma. Depending on the time of the year that you visit, the area activities can vary and do impact the experience. The weekend of a game at Petco Stadium can be a crowded time, but also holidays and certain conferences. This is a popular conference hotel with large meeting facilities and adjacency to the San Diego Convention Center a few yards down the path. Events vary so ask the hotel staff what is going on when you are booking your trip. We have stayed during several conferences including a bridge tournament, a financial advisors meeting and a religious youth conference: all very different. Ask about hotel and local events before you book. The hotel is also walking distance to the parks around the boat harbor. On this trip, there was a concert at the park with fireworks afterwards. On the same night, there was a game at Petco stadium that ended with fireworks. We saw two fireworks shows from our room in the same night (think: LOUD, but fun). Also loud are the trains that run in front of the hotel, including the alarm clanging at the crossings when the trollies pass. Fortunately, the trains and alarms do not run all night, but they would prevent you from taking an afternoon nap if you were a light sleeper. If you are looking for a quiet getaway, it would be difficult to find in downtown San Diego with its big city sounds. Try the Hotel Del Coronado for a beachfront experience. The main pool is on a very large deck with outdoor areas for families with children. There is also an adult pool, Kin Oasis, for guests who are 21 years or older. The adult pool is next to the spa. The spa is a great place for a massage, hair or nail service, but you may want to ask about any booked events at the Kin Oasis pool if you want a quiet spa experience. The adult pool is no longer part of the spa and operates as a bar with food service. There are two cabanas available for rent as sitting areas for cocktails, not for typical relaxing by the pool in a chaise lounge chair. The lack of sun protection options for the adult pool is a disappointment. The family pool on the main deck has several cabanas for relaxing by the pool. We book a AAA package to include full breakfast at Lael's, a significant value. The buffet is large and includes fruits, nuts, pastries, traditional hot breakfast items, waffles and an omelet station. Eat all you want and then go for a walk along the water to work off the calories. One major change was the sale of the property in March, 2011. The Manchester family sold the hotel to a group of investors. We observed no significant differences during our stay. There was live jazz in the hotel's lounge area on Friday night. We had never seen this before and may be something new (but not sure). The hotel does sell out and does overbook rooms. If you are the victim of overbooking, we were told that the Hyatt pays for your accommodations at another hotel. This has never happened to us, but we usually arrive early in the afternoon. The hotel has two large towers and we have stayed in both. No significant differences except maybe the content of the views. The newer tower has end rooms with windows facing Coronado island. We stayed in one of these rooms one weekend and it was a nice feature, but not a necessity. The hotel is also walking distance to the Gaslamp district with great restaurant and night life choices. Ask the concierge for recommendations and bring good walking shoes. There are also pedi-cabs that will offer you a ride. The pedal pumpers charge about $12-15 for a distance that you could walk in about 10-15 minutes. We rode one once because it was warmer than walking on a cold night. The night temps do cool down in San Diego, even in the summer, so bring a light jacket or sweater for evenings. Our room was a bit musty on this stay, but the air conditioning worked well and we opened the room's window for some fresh air. The Hyatt now offers a room category for people who have allergies: hypoallergenic bedding and an air filtration system. We stay at the Hyatt for a getaway from work, so we have never used internet services.

<Title>“Stayed during Comic Con...happy stay!”
<Content>A lot of the reviews I read were not happy with hotel service and quality. We had a great experience. The room could be updated, but it was clean, quiet, and had an amazing view. The location could not have been better, in the Gas Lamp right next to Sea Port Village. The hotel is huge, but somehow the staff knew who we were and treated us amazingly. The front desk staff was very kind and organized. Comic Con is the busiest weekend in San Diego all year with 300,000 extra visitors in the city. The hotel handled all of the extra stress with class. At one point when I had to wait 5 minutes for a cab they apologized and offered me a ride in their private SUV...which was great! The pool and outdoor areas were very nice, and the fires at night were perfect. I would stay here again.

<Title>“Very Enjoyable Stay”
<Content>Stayed here for a week for a business conference. My original reservation was split into two requiring me to switch rooms in the middle because of a lack of availability. When I checked in, the front desk lady just shook her head, made a comment about "why do they do this?" and combined everything keeping me in the same room for the whole stay. Ended up with a two double bed room facing the pool. I would agree with other posters that the rooms are somewhat dated decor wise but it was very well kept. That's all I really care about. Beds were comfortable with a 32" LCD TV that actually had HD channels. I used the pool facilities whenever I could and thought they were excellent. Usually not a problem to find a recliner and the double hottubs were terrific. There is a smaller adults only pool attached to the spa which I never used but heard from co-workers that though quiet, was quite cramped. The fitness area was very impressive. Most of my meals were provided via my conference. We did have evening drinks in one of the many bars on premises - very, very pricey. As is the bar menu for average food. So many good restaurants around the area on the boardwalk - you have no need to eat here. Service was excellent all-round from the front desk to the very helpful concierge. This hotel is massive but the staff treated me very well. Easy walking distance to everything. My only real complaint is something that has nothing to do with the hotel but more the location - the trolley line is across the street. There must be some San Diego bylaw that states all trolleys must honk their horn a zillion times when going through intersections regardless of the time of day. Constant honking of horns up to 1-2am (whenever they stopped). Very annoying - and something you'll get at any hotel in the area. And another note - other posters have commented that this hotel overbooks on a regular basis. My stay would seem to confirm this as during my stay, we received letters asking us if we would be willing to relocate to a different hotel in exchange for Hyatt Pts, credit, and other bonuses. I wonder what would've happened if nobody said 'yes'? .

<Title>“Have Customer Service Wired”
<Content>We stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego for 9 nights that we booked via Priceline.com. The king room was a decent size, exceptionally clean and well maintained while we were there. The only thing was both the bathroom faucet and shower/bath faucet dripped. However this did not disturb us nor take away from our wonderful experience there in any way. The entire staff was exceptional at customer service. I mean they have it wired. The exceptionally high level of service, friendliness, smiles and polite manners made our time in San Diego the best vacation we have had there. I would venture to say the Hyatt Management probably treats their employees with respect and the same type of politeness they displayed with us. Both Kudos and THANKS to the entire Staff at the Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego. Bob and Darelle Wood.

<Title>“Best Location in San Diego for first time visitor”
<Content>Stayed here for 6 days 2 weeks ago... beautful hotel, fantastic location. Stayed in Superior King room on 24th floor with breathtaking view of San Diego bay, the carrier Midway and Coronado. Room was nice enough; clean with huge flat screen TV and comfy bed. Didn't use the pool area, but it seemed to be crowded with kids; there are cabanas for rent and a tiki bar... at night, there are sitting areas with firepits and telescopes to take in the views. There is also a spa and fitness center I didn't use, but looked nicely equipped. The lobby bar is unbelievably classy and beautiful with great huge art pieces; but is outdone by the views afforded by the lounge on the 40th floor, which surrounds you with floor to ceiling windows; again, real classy and top rate in every way. To the rear of the hotel is "Seaport Village" with numerous little shops, resturants and snack bars... music is often played by different types of musicians who are trying to sell/promote their CD's; they were all very good. Continue to walk along the seawall and you will find more restaurants (mostly seafood), and a bit further, the Carrier Midway, which is now a museum... a bit further is the ferry to Coronado which is docked near the Maritime museum. For further excursions, the Trolley is right across the street. From their you can ge to many of the destinations in San Diego, including Old Town and the heart of the Gas Lamp district's restaurant row (4th, 5th 6th Avenue). All in all a great hotel and trip. Got a great deal from Expedia, but booked early.

<Title>“Grand Time! Nice Hotel!”
<Content>This hotel was very nice, staff was helpful and friendly. Check-in went smoothly and they even upgraded us to a Suite, no extra charge! One this hotel has been around for a while and although it's true it needs updating overall it was still an impressive hotel, beautiful on the inside and out. Pools, seems there are two, one Family and one Adults only near the Spa. Both very nice although the Family one is quite larger, both also have Hot Tubs but close around 10 PM. the hotel offers S'mores kits to enjoy at the various fire pits around the pool area. Hotel and Grounds were well maintained and kept clean. Our Room (777) was large and open with a spectacular view of both the city and the bay, big kitchenette with a full sized refrigerator, sink, microwave, large dining table w/ chairs, separate sitting area with flat panel TV and comfortable couches. The furniture is a little worn and dated but not too bad, no holes! Room was quiet, away from elevators, air conditioned. There is a lounge located on the top floor which offers great appetizers and cocktails, not too pricey, we went by the lounge located on one end of the Lobby but for some reason it was Party night, we couldn't even elbow our way in! They also have a more relaxed lounge at the other end of the Lobby that also offers snacks, drinks and even mini bottles of alcohol that you can take to your room, however the snack bar doesn't stay open very late at all, good for a quick breakfast! We stayed during the Comic Con Event and were quite pleased with the hospitality, and not that far of a walk. I usually went out the back of the hotel near the harbor ( nice relaxing walk) and strolled over to the Marriott next door and out to the front of the Concention Center, far less crowded than the sidewalks. Plus I was able to pick-up some items to snack on during the day at the Marriotts Comic Con snack bar set up in their Lobby. The city is pretty maneuverable without a taxi for the most part, if you enjoy walking; but the taxis are pretty decent price wise and try to get you to your destination as quickly as they can. DO NOT take a ride in those bike carts or they will take YOU for a "ride"! Would stay here again! By the by, I had heard through the staff that this hotel was soon going to be undergoing a major renovation. !!! Oh and a word of CAUTION* to those that pay for the Wi-Fi, we were charged and then later told that the $12.95 fee is applied towards every computer used, not just for the day. THIS was something that seemed very dishonest; other hotels only charge for the day period, no matter hoe many computers in the room are using the Wi-Fi !!!

<Title>“Great Location - mediocre everything else”
<Content>We're San Diego locals and stayed over the weekend for a second honeymoon. This is a huge Super Walmart of a hotel...Made the reservations online and requested a room with a king bed with the option of upgrading to a suite at check-in time. Did the kiosk check-in, got upgraded and everything appeared to go smoothly. Walked into our "suite" and found it to be more like a conference room - with a small murphy bed - WTH? After several phone calls to the front desk, somebody finally came up with keys to an adjoining room...two twin beds. Of course, nothing else was available. The hotel is badly in need of remodeling and a deep cleaning. Our rooms had many, many stains in the carpet and almost all the furniture was stained and dingy. The breakfast buffet was OK, nothing you couldn't find at and Embassy Suites or Comfort Inn. The top of the Hyatt lounge has excellent views of the city and the bay from the 40th floor . Great desserts too. Worth a quick stop even if you don't stay at the Hyatt.

<Content>The hotel is located in the middle of everything!!! We love to go there and walk down to Sea Port Village and go to all the little shops. This time we walked to Petco Park to watch a game.The bell staff, concierge, housekeeping staff were all very friendly and helpful. The only bad part was that we did have to wait at least an hour to check in because our room was not ready yet. We also were suprised that the adult pool closed so early while the regular pool and jaccuzzi stayed open late but there were always filled with kids.

<Content>Quick check-in, helpful bellman, good food for buffet lunch at conference. The rooms are very quiet, clean but not immaculate, and a little dated. The furniture and carpets are showing some wear (lowering the overall score to 4 stars). The shampoos and soaps supplied in the bathroom are very nice and the terrycloth robe was soft and cushy. The carpets corners and baseboard areas are collecting dust. The staff are all friendly and helpful. Overall the location is great, near the water, the Gas Lamp District and 15 minutes from the airport. If you are not a Hyatt member you pay $28/24-hour of internet--which is the most expensive internet I have ever encountered!

<Content>We visited San Diego last Thanksgiving with some friends. We stayed in 3 different rooms and got the great views: the bay view with the yachts and Seaport Village, the city view, also the pool view. The hotel is located in Downtown, also near by the Seaport Village. (+) The room was clean and cozy, with the tea/coffee maker, refrigerator, and big flat screen TV. You can ask to get 1 king bed size or 2 full bed size, maybe they didn't have queen bed size. (-) There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom. And the garage parking was quite expensive, it's about $25-26 per night

<Title>“Serviced by great staff”
<Content>I visited the Manchester Hyatt for a conference in December for my company. Let me start out by mentioning that there are several different towers, so you might want to note this when booking and also reading reviews. I stayed in the seaport tower, which has really nice views of the Seaport and the hustle and bustle of the city below. Nice room with a good sized bathroom-PLENTY of room for my train case packed with makeup, hair products, and every other cosmetic product under the sun. Let's talk about the service here, because that is really what shined at this hotel. I had the pleasure of having a few after-hours cocktails at the Top of the Hyatt Lounge after my conference. I forgot my credit card at the bar and only realized this just minutes before I had to checkout and head to the airport. The hospitality manager went out of his way to make sure that I received my credit card-personally hand delivering it to my room. This type of exceptional customer service experience makes me want to stay here any time I'm in San Diego for business. I only gave the hotel 3 out of 5 only because it was quite exhausting walking back and forth through this huge hotel to navigate from my room, to meetings, and then the restaurant. Other than that, I'd give it a 4.

Everything, seriously everything is within walking distance... everything except Balboa Park/Zoo and that is only around $12 cab fare adn well worth it!. The hotel staff were very focused and sincere about ensuring we had everything we needed, it si teh staff that that made our week long long get away memorable and relaxing and fun.

<Title>“adequate; avoid club level”
<Content>Checked in very late (about 1am) and was met by a rather surly agent who had little interest in helping me, even though I was the only person in the enormous lobby. Had a king room on club level. Decor is surprisingly old fashioned and appears quite dated. Even on this high level, the sound of the passing trains was surprisingly disruptive. The club room breakfast is a bit of a joke, and one of the worst examples of a club lounge I've ever come across. They only serve breakfast there during limited hours, and the breakfast is very basic. The room itself is small and has no atmosphere. Nobody would pick up the phone there when I called. Service staff disappeared (the coffee ran out and the server indicated he'd have to go all the way down to the basement to get a new carafe - amazing!) The tables weren't cleared. Just a disappointing mess. Meeting rooms are quite poorly signposted. Overall a pretty poor experience. Not recommended.

<Content>The rooms were just ok. But..the location if you want to be in downtown SD was perfect. We stayed in a special allergy friendly room (to be by another fam member) and had the ozonator going which was very helpful when sleeping because the train can be a little loud. Room was a little dusty and I would not suggest 2 people in a double bed. I would have never gotten to sleep if I had to share. But besides that, the hotel is beautiful and you can't beat the 4th floor pool overlooking the city and ocean. The views for the rooms were awesome as well. They have a samores fire pit out by the pool at night. I would stay here again and ask to upgrade the room. Great hotel for the price.

<Title>“Good”
<Content>My teenage children and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt in July 2011. Before I made reservations, I read alot of the blogs and took alot of advice from there. Yes, I did by my own water down the street at Ralphs along with snacks because the hotel water is $4.50 and paid $3.99 for a pack of 24. Also the rooms were a little dated. The down comforters kept blowing out feathers and I had to have housekeeping replace the ones upon arrival because there were some type of red stains on it and I wasn't sure if it was blood or nail polish but didn't want to take the chance. However, the view was absolutely beautiful. We slept with the curtains open the entire time we were there. The work out room was also awesome. What could be better than working out and looking out at the marina? AWESOME. We walked down to the gaslamp district to eat which is just a couple of blocks. Overall 1 out 10 (10 being the highest) I would rate our stay about an 8. Oh, one more thing the parking is quite expensive $26 a day. Enjoy and I would return next year because the advised me that they will be doing renovations early 2012. Love, love San Diego :-)!!!!

<Content>It was our wedding anniversary so we chose beautiful San Diego! As usual, the weather was perfect. And, we were pleased with our stay in the Grand Hyatt. We were told this was the largest hotel in the West, and we believe it. It is huge and quite impressive. The lobby is like a work of art. It is beautiful! The staff at the front desk and the concierge were all very kind and friendly and everyone we met went out of their way to provide great service. The location of the hotel can't be beat. You're waterside, and you are steps away from the Sea Port Village, a darling little tourist area of shops and eating establishments. You're also within walking distance to the Gas Lamp district for wonderful night life. The hotel is in an idea location to see all that San Diego has to offer. ACCOMMODATIONS: Our room was a standard King and we got a very good rate ($110) through Priceline. Getting such a beautiful room at such a good deal helped us overlook a few of the problems we might have otherwise complained about. We were placed up on the 27th floor, and the room came with a spectacular view of the bay. I loved the fact that the window opened slightly to let in the sea breezes. But what an awesome view!!! Do try to get a room on one of the higher floors with a view if you can. The bed was wonderful and we slept quite well in it. The bedding was high-quality and the black-out draperies allowed us to sleep in as long as our bodies required. It was an excellent sleeping room - quiet and comfortable. No complaints there! IN-ROOM AMENITIES: I had some trouble when I first arrived as I could not find the coffee pot. I was quite disappointed, until I found it neatly tucked away inside the T.V. Cabinet. I was, however, disappointed to find that the room lacked a microwave and a refrigerator. Actually, this surprised me, as I always thought they were standard. We did have a little unit inside the TV cabinet, which we thought was a malfunctioning refrigerator, but when we spoke to the hotel engineer, we found it was not a refrigerator but a cooler. TIP: If you want a refrigerator and/or microwave, you need to make sure you are put into a roof with those features,. Perhaps they will provide them to you if you call the desk - I don't know. Just be sure in advance though, as we had some perishable food and it did not keep well in the 'cooler'. INTERNET: I always bring my laptop and the Hyatt did provide internet high speed access in-room. There is a fee of about $10.00 per day to use the service in the room. It may be free downstairs in the lobby area or other hot spots in the hotel, you would have to check on that, but expect to pay if you use it in your room. PARKING: Parking is available in a covered garage adjacent to the hotel. It's easy access and exit. There is a daily charge for parking. However, I can't remember right now how much I paid. You can self-park or use the valet. You can go in and out as many times as you want without extra charges. But be prepared to pay parking. There's no way around it. T.V. DISAPPOINTMENT: It was a lovely flat screen T.V. with a large sized screen, but for the life of me, I could never find a 'free' movie channel while there. Perhaps it was just 'me', but I couldn't even find an HBO showing free movies, and I didn't want to pay to watch one. FOOD: San Diego tourist areas are just plan expensive, particularly anywhere there on the bay side. It is hard to get around it. The hotel had some lovely restaurants, but on the pricey side. Sea Port Village, just steps away from the Hotel, is also pricey. We went off-site and away from the immediate area to eat. We found our healthy food place (Panera Bread) by Horton Plaza and had breakfast one morning. We walked to the Karl Straus Brewery for lunch for good Pub Food and a beer. For another lunch we ate at our favorite "The Fish Market Seafood Restaurant" which is right on the bay and within a short walking distance from the hotel (Expect tourist prices there, though you can buy some wonderful smoked albacore tuna or ceviche from the fresh fish counter inside the restaurant and take it back to the hotel).. Of course there is Anthony's Seafood Grotto, a major tourist seafood place, but it can be very, very busy at times.. TIP: If you want to save yourself a lot of money (particularly if you have kids with you) - be prepared. Either bring with you, or go find a grocery store, and stock up on bottled water, drinks, snacks and fruit for your room. OLD TOWN TROLLEY: First time we've done one of the Trolly Tours and we loved it! Tickets about $30.00 each for my husband and I. We bought them from the concierge desk at the hotel but you can also get them at the "Old Town Trolley" ticket kiosk nearby at the Sea Port Village. It's a low stress way to tour around San Diego: You can hop on and off and stay as long as you want at any of it's pre-chosen stops. You don't have to stress with finding expensive parking and fighting with the extensive tourist traffic if you take the Trolley. And, it is fun as the drivers give you some background 'tour driver' type information and attempt to be funny (some are really good!). We've been to San Diego many, many times and never taken this little Trolley, and I'm so glad we finally did! The hotel does seem to be very well prepared for families with children. It is a resort type atmosphere. There is a fire pit by the pool where the kids can cook marshmallows in the evening. Everyone seemed to be having lots of fun as I looked down from my room window 27 stories up! Through my open window, I enjoyed the beautiful sounds of children laughing and having fun. It was heart warming. So, it did seem to be a good place for parents to bring their children. I've probably forgotten something that I'll regret not saying later on, but that's the way it goes. I hope this helps someone. I'll attach a couple photos to give you an idea of the views we had from our room. Be sure to ask them for the type of accommodation that you want. It's your vacation and you want to be happy with where you are. I've learned it's always best to ask. Blessings, Southern California Couple

<Title>“Can't decide what it wants to be”
<Content>This hotel is an interesting study in trying to be all things to all people, and in the family travelling department, it falls a little short. Very impressive public areas, which are fun to explore, and a large shallow pool, which is also nice. The rooms are fine, but not nearly as special as the other hotel areas would suggest they might be. The main problem is the cost of everything and the discouragement to bring your own supplies, food, etc. There was a tiny fridge in the room which was ok, though not big enough to hold more than a few cans of soda. Outside food or drinks are not allowed in the pool area, and a bottle of water in the room is $4.50. The room service is WAY expensive, $8 for a bowl of oatmeal for instance; the "breakfast buffet" ranged from $12.50 for cold cereal to $24 for hot food as well. They have a place to make s'mores at night, very cool idea...until you see the steep price tag for a "s'more kit". Luckily another family at the fire offered to share their s'more stuff (brought in from the "outside") so my niece and I got to participate for free. There are lots of business people around, and I think this is where they make most of their money. But when you can't charge everything to a business expense account, the bill adds up quickly. The location by the docks and a little tourist place called seaport village is a plus. I have no huge complaints, but I think I'd try somewhere else next time.

<Title>“Outstanding wedding reception”
<Content>We could not have been more pleased with our reception venue; everything was beautiful and top quality, from the food to the outstanding service. I will start with our amazing catering manager, Reshma Singh, who made the experience very pleasant with her professionalism, efficiency and great care; she made us feel as if our wedding was the only and most special one; she was always prompt in her response and provided us with solutions. We were also very pleased with the food (as foodies this was one of our priorities) not only we truly enjoyed the tasting to create the wedding menu, but we were pleasantly surprise that they were able to maintain the quality for 60 people the day of the wedding. Our reception room was on the 32nd floor, beautiful, completely private for us and our guest, and with the most beautiful views. And as a special treat they upgraded us to the penthouse suite on the 42nd floor, it was wonderful!

<Title>“Great Hotel!!”
<Content>One of my family members just got married this past weekend at the Hyatt and we all received such great service by Corey and his staff. Most importantly was our first encounter with one of the front office agents JOSEPH MITCHELL!! He went above and beyond to help us out when we first checked into the hotel. Leaving us all with a great first impression of what we were to experience for the rest of the weekend. He was very kind and knowledgeable and provided us with exceptional service. We look forward to a future “stay-cation” in our beautiful home town of San Diego.

<Title>“$200.00/night and NO microwave or internet included!!!”
<Content>THE PLUSES: beautiful view over the harbor; wonderful fresh air breeze in room; enjoyed the gym & spa; quiet room. No bedbugs. Staff was very helpful and friendly. THE DISAPPOINTMENTS: no microwave, no housekeeping/bathroom tidying our second night and had to call and ask for fresh towels. I had left our old towels on the bathroom floor in a pile for ease of pick up and they were not picked up. Trash was not dumped, we were out of toilet paper. No internet service unless you pay $10.00/day extra. Parking is $26/day, which I went into knowing but still is expensive. One more reason that Hyatt should be providing basics like microwave and housekeeping. Breakfast brunch @Lael's was WAY overpriced: $17.50 for cereal, fruit, yogurt, muffins,coffee, juice, cheese. THE BOTTOM LINE: We've had more complete accomodations a much lesser named hotels (microwave, internet, proper cleaning, etc.) for much less money. We very surprised and disappointed that Hyatt did not provide these extra services at the price we paid for our room.

<Title>“Staff Unprofessional and IMMATURE”
<Content>I had the usual problems - Reservation was wrong upon checking in, Rooms outdated and not very comfortable, Staff there just to put in time for a paycheck etc. But I travel so much, and see these things so often that it’s almost become a standard. But this occurrence was so absurd I had to send a review. Business Trip - Booked 2 rooms, 6 nights. Upon checking out, my colleague informed me that the internet charges were removed complimentary so I would not have any extra charges for their room on my Credit Card. Great since paying for internet seemed ridiculous anyway. Upon checking out of my own room I inquired about any extra charges and thanked them for crediting the internet charges. Upon hearing this, the clerk asked many additional questions and left to make further inquiries. I assumed perhaps they were going to credit my internet as well. Wrong...When she returned she informed very rudely that the internet would be recharged because the credit was supposed to be a secret and my colleague wasn’t supposed to tell anyone. ??? Anyway if the hotel needs the $40 that badly, they can have it but will not get any of my business anymore.

<Title>“Beautiful hotel in great location”
<Content>We stayed in a tower room with a fabulous view over the harbor and the Coronado bridge. Beds were very comfortable. There was no venting fan in the bathroom which made it very steamy and hot after showering. Fortunately we could open the bedroom windows. We were on the concierge floor and the breakfast, afternoon snacks, and late night desserts were delicious.

<Title>“Loved it! Great Views! Large Resort-Like Hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here over a weekend and we were surprised at how large this hotel was. It's a large resort style hotel located near downtown San Diego. There are public transportation trams located right in front of the hotel so it's easy to get around if you need to. We took the train down from Los Angeles to San Diego and the train station is within walking distance of the hotel (about a good 15-20 minutes walk). That might seem pretty far for people living in Los Angeles but it really isn't too bad. The rooms and bathrooms are large and everything looks pretty nice and new. The rooms were extremely comfortable. There are two large towers to the hotel with large windows so you can see the amazing view of San Diego or the marina in front of you.

<Title>“We enjoyed it!”
<Content>The Manchester Grand Hyatt is a lovely, service oriented hotel, which does its best to make its guests feel comfortable and welcome. Our room was a bit dissapointing when we checked in, as the cleaning person who readied the room could have cleaned the bathroom a bit better. That was our only complaint. The location is wonderful, the view from our room was lovely, and there was more than enough room for the conference we attended.

<Title>“Great Hotel for the price”
<Content>We stayed here one night in July. We booked through priceline and got a great deal! The location of the hotel is very convenient if you are in San Diego for a conference as it is very close the convention center. The gaslamp is walkable (if you are not wearing heels!) or is a short $8 cab ride. The view from our room was spectacular, overlooking the habor and the pool (which is nice). You are right next door to Seaport Village and across the street from kansas city BBQ (hole in the wall with great bbq, known for having some Top Gun scenes filmed there). I like that you are close enough to the gaslamp to party if you choose too, but the hotel is far enough away to remain family friendly and not cater to the booze hound crew that over takes some of the other hotels directly in the gaslamp. We got a 2 queen room, it had a little sitting area and was comfortable. The hotel is not outdated but not modern (again like other gaslamp hotels). It was very clean and I didn't feel like it was old. The parking is $36 for the night - which is lame but in the range of most hotel in downtown area. I would definitely stay here again, great location. We will be back!

<Title>“SDCC and so much more!”
<Content>Each year Comic Con brings thousands of people to San Diego and with it, loads of competition for accommodations. We were fortunate enough to book 4 rooms over the course of the week, all at the Manchester Grand Hyatt! Upon check in on Tuesday, the concierge was good enough to go over our entire rooming list, and make sure the appropriate names were on the correct room. We were also able to arrange parking and get extra keys. They also sent up two refrigerators, which were put to very good use. The fitness centre was fully equipped, very clean, and it was an absolutely fantastic to work out in! The pool deck was large and well kept, and made for a terrific place to recover and refresh during the day, and after a long day at the convention. The only caution I would give to visitors is to make sure you pull your door tightly shut when leaving the room, as they do not close fully without prompting. Luckily his quirk was noticed on our first day, and we were careful to pull them firmly closed all week. Over the past few years we have stayed at several hotels in and around the convention centre. The Hyatt was by far the most convenient and pleasant to stay in. Our service was terrific from start to finish, and each night was comfortable, and enjoyable. We will definitely look to visit the Manchester Grand Hyatt again next year!!

<Title>“Not what I would have expected from a Grand Hyatt”
<Content>I stayed here for a couple of nights attending a conference. While the location on the waterfront and close to downtown area is excellent, the hotel itself was a bit of a disappointment for me. I changed rooms during my stay because my first room on the 29th floor in the Harbor Tower was directly above the set of elevators that serve floors 1 to 28 and therefore was quite noisy. My request was handled professionally, no questions asked. I found the rooms and bathrooms to be quite dated and the service (aside from the front desk) quite sloppy. A couple of examples: in one room the “wired” internet connection wasn’t physically connected to anything, while it the other room it was. The “free” wired/wireless internet service is pretty much useless. When I arrived in the first room one of the water bottles available for purchase for $4.50 was open and half-empty (I wasn’t charged for it though). There were used dishes from a previous guest outside the door of my second room, and were not cleared away until late evening. This is not what I expect of a Grand Hyatt hotel. My recent stay at the Bayfront Hilton "next door" was a much better experience and I would not stay at this Grand Hyatt again.

<Title>“Looking at the lobby one gets excited about the rooms, BIG DISAPPOINTMENT worst Hyatt rooms ever 2 STARS”
<Content>I'm a hyatt platinum member, also a gold hyatt member, my family and I decided to stay at this hyatt on our 7 night vacation because of the location and the pictures on their web site. We arrived and checked in with a member of their friendly staff, went up to the room only to realize that the place smelt like an "ash tray", with 2 kids 2yrs & 5yrs we headed back down to the platinum checkin desk. We then payed more to upgrade our room which was on the opposite tower on the 24th floor. Got to our 2 room apartment, to my discuss the once cream carpet was brown or maybe green, the bathroom tiles was cracked on the floor and the grout was mouldy and black, in the dresser cabinet there was holes to the side, I guess it was missing equipment, the phone on the desk was DEAD, the IPod doc did not work, the beds and sheets seems as old as my mother. The only updated thing was the TV. We arrived about 14:00 on a Monday afternoon, the kids immediately wanted to go to the pool, we changed and headed straight over there, it was a good chance for us to get the kids out of this ROOM. After 10 min at the pool, my wife and I taught we will have a couple cocktails, only to find out there is no bar or restaurant at the pool side on Monday's ( we went back on thursday at 16:00 after the zoo and the said their temporary bar set up had closed) so I had to go 4 levels down a log back up 5 drinks + peanuts + chips. On a better note service at the hotel and the dinner we had at Sally's was great also was the buffet breakfast in the hotel the next few mornings. Room service on the other hand ..... After holding on the phone for over 8 mins the food was awful. If you don't mind a 2 STAR hotel check it out, if you want better stay far away. The only updated thins wast the flat screen TV

<Content>This beautiful hotel is a must stay. Super convenient to just about everything. Basically it's a walk across the street to the "Gas Lamp" district, Seacoast Village, Petco Park, and the beautiful waterfront. The rooms were nice and clean. Great views from most of them too. The only draw back would be the parking fee or else I would have given it 5 stars!

<Title>“Fantastic upscale hotel”
<Content>I stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt for four days as part of a business conference. The hotel is definitely opulent and in front of Seaport Village. A friend stayed with me - our hotel room was nothing terribly exciting - clean, airy with in-room safe and fridge. No microwave and no air fan in the bathroom. Our hotel room overlooked the spacious pool - which we didn't get a chance to try out. As a hotel guest, I did try out the 24 hour fitness centre. It is one of the better fitness centres that I've seen with full circuit weight machines, rows of ellipticals, bikes and treadmills, and a small mirrored wall area with cables, yoga mats, Bosu, and medicine balls. Fresh eucalpytus scented towels and water are included in the fitness centre, so you need to only bring down yourself. I'm not a big fan of working out while on business or vacation, but this fitness centre made it really hard to resist. I didn't get to experience any of the restaurants on-site, with the exception of two. The lobby area serves as a lounge and you can order drinks and a full meal. The service is not very good between 9 pm - 11 pm. I wouldn't wait there for a meal, but perhaps to take in a drink or two (tip: sit at the bar so you get faster service). The other thing to denote for caffeine lovers - there is no Starbucks on site. The nearest one is across the street located at another hotel. There is a small coffee shop on-site that serves Starbucks coffee, but it's quite expensive, the food selection is not great and the line-ups are very long. They get a lot of business, undoubtedly from conference delegates who are caffeine-deprived, but the food and drink is really not very good for such a grand hotel. The hotel is within walking distance to downtown San Diego and it felt quite safe walking there during the day and night. If you don't want to go that far, you can always explore the restaurants and trinkets in Seaport Village, although it becomes quite deserted at night (not recommeded if you travel solo at night). Great coffee and eats await you in Seaport and there is a very lovely bookstore/cafe there that is absolutely charming and doesn't smell at all like Indigo or Barnes & Nobles. Seaport Village has a great seawall that you walk around for about 30 minutes in length - both ways. A great walk, especially if you have a dog. If you're looking to get out of the area and venture into outlet shopping, you can take the trolley bus to the Las Americas Outlet, just outside the Mexican border. I went to this outlet about five years ago and scored big, but this time came back empty-handed. It's a pretty far trip by trolley and I recommend going during daylight hours. You may spend up to 6 hours there if you're a hard core shopper, less if you're only going to specific stores. The trolley bus system in general is a bit confusing. Pay attention to the directions and to the bus signs. It is, however, the cheapest way to get around town so a little bit of inconvenience allows you to save your $$ for eats and shopping. San Diego is a really beautiful city any time of the year. The only other lasting impression I have is that it's a very dog-friendly city. We saw dogs everywhere from hotels to malls and all along Seaport Village (be sure to visit the doggie store in the Village for pampered pooch treats). I don't know if the Hyatt is a dog-friendly hotel, but we did see a few in the lobby so it's worth mentioning. This hotel is probably the biggest Hyatt that I've ever stayed in. Were it not for the fact that my employer paid for this conference, I probably wouldn't be able to afford to stay at this place for vacation. Even with the minor hiccups (e.g. bad coffee on-site, boring but clean room), it is undoubtedly a 5-star hotel. The concierge desk also deserves mention as they were unfailing helpful with three requests: 1. getting my fridge up and running; 2. getting immediate drycleaning for my ketchup spill all over my white jacket; and 3. mapping out our transportation routes to get to where we needed to go. My conclusion: if you are staying here for your conference - lucky you! Make time to enjoy the scenery outside the hotel and its on-site facilities. If you are debating on whether to book this hotel for your next San Diego vacation, try finding a price break on Hotwire or Priceline. You won't regret it once you pull up to the hotel.

<Title>“Me and My Husband's getaway trip”
<Content>The staff was nice and very informative. $600 for 3 nights, not bad. I had a room with a nice view. But everything else in the hotel was a bit pricey. After spending 3 nights there, the buffet was $24.00 so we ate at Dennys. No wi-fi for the internet. Have to pay extra. $36.00 a day for valet. So they hold $150.00 up front. Got charged for valet for 3 days even though we only used it for one day. Then also got charged the $27.00 per day for the other 2 days we parked our own car. They charge for every little thing. Even bottled water, so bring your own. The walls are thin so you here everything in the next room. If you don't mind the doors slamming even during the week it gets to be bothersome. Liked separate pool with no kids. We did have a frig. Top of the Hyatt drinks are a bit pricey.

<Title>“Decent stay for a business trip”
<Content>I stayed at the Hyatt Manchester Grand 7/10/11 – 7/15/11 for a conference. Three of my coworkers stayed next door at the Marriott. I had a standard king room in the harbor tower: - Room was spacious and clean. Yes, the furnishings are a little older and do show some wear but nothing was stained or shabby. Considering the current focus on going green isn’t it better to use perfectly good things longer anyway? - All of the staff that I interacted with were polite, friendly and helpful. - Check-in: I arrived early and parked in the garage, then used an automated kiosk in the lobby to see if my room was ready. It wasn’t, but the kiosk gave me the option of receiving a text message when my room was ready. I entered my cell phone # and decided to visit my parents (I’m originally from San Diego). I expected to have to pay since I did park; however, I was in the hotel less than 30 minutes and the parking attendant did not charge a fee. I received a text message later in the day letting me know my room was ready. - My room was larger than my coworker’s standard room at the Marriott and had a refrigerator – hers did not. Although the water pressure at the sink could be better, the shower was great. - There is a great bar on top of the harbor tower with fantastic views. My conference ended early one day so I headed up with my ebook. Although the premium margarita I ordered was $14, I spent an hour relaxing, enjoying the view and reading … and it was a darn good marg. All in all, worth the $14. - Had crab cakes at Sally’s one evening and they were fantastic (much better than the ones I got at a famous restaurant in Baltimore). - Walking distance: Marriot next door, Seaport Village (it still has some cute shops and restaurants), Midway aircraft carrier museum (worth touring if you have time!), Ralph’s grocery store, CVS, gaslamp district, trolley station, convention center, Star of India, Anthony’s (don’t bother – it’s gone way downhill and no longer deserves the reputation it earned 30 years ago), and the Fish Market. Pet Peeves: - The maids did not replace dirty water glasses … in fact one day the dirty glass was turned back over and set on the coaster again. - I had to ask for more coffee packs on one occasion (but they were replaced daily after that) - Hyatt stocks the WORST complimentary toiletries in the industry. It’s some sort of musty, musky stinky floral sent that they call “white ginger.” I love the smell of ginger, but their fragrance bears no resemblance to the natural scent. I try to travel light and didn’t bring my own shampoo, conditioner and lotion. Fortunately my coworkers who stayed at the Marriott had mercy on me and shared theirs (Marriott uses great smelling Bath and Bodyworks products). - Bottom sheets: Hyatt doesn’t purchase fitted sheets, therefore the maids have to make do with top sheets that are inadequate to fully cover the bottom and tuck in securely. I’m an RN with a black belt in bed making. If I can’t get the bottom sheet to stay smooth and secure, nobody can. The bottom sheets come loose and creep up, then the bed pad underneath bunches up, and it’s generally uncomfortable. WTF are they thinking??? - Parking is outrageous at $26/day (with in/out privileges). Standard for the area though. - Wi-Fi was nearly $13 per day. It makes me nuts that I can get free Wi-Fi at Starbucks, McDonalds, Village Inn, etc. where I’m spending less than $10. It’s downright insulting to be charged for Wi-Fi when I’m already paying $1403.90 for my room + parking.

<Title>“Comic Con 2011”
<Content>My sister and I stayed at the Hyatt for Comic Con in July of 2011. With all of the people, chaos, events, goings on, etc, I would call it a true test of a hotel's nature, customer service, and accommodations...to which Hyatt and its staff performed brilliantly! Everyone was so nice! Things were relatively clean and quiet; the only noise resulted from the nearby trains and airport (and that is great considering the thousands and thousands in town for CC). The front desk staff were fabulous and the room service food was fantastic! The lobby was gorgeous as was the view from our room. Only a few things of note - the employees in the gift shop were a bit rude and they could use a better variety of supplies. Oh, and the people in the little shops behind the hotel were unfriendly and the food quality was rather poor. Save up your money and order pizza and the brownie sundae via room service! It is within walking distance of the Convention Center, but a longer walk than they estimate. It is also farther from the Gaslamp Quarter than they say, but still walkable. We will definitely stay here again!

<Title>“Great hotel!”
<Content>I read many of the trip advisor reviews before we went. As a result I asked for a corner room in the North tower. It was perfect! It had the extra room for the pack n play, very spacious. The staff was great, all room service meals were delivered in less than 30 minutes during Comicon. My daughter enjoyed the pool and play area.

<Title>“Great Location for Convention Center, Seaport Village & Downtown”
<Content>We obtained a great rate on the Hyatt website using our AAA membership. After booking Hyatt offers the option to upgrade your room at a discounted price. We were lucky and were upgraded to a conference suite for $109 more a night. Well worth it! The views were great and the suite had a full living room, dining room and kitchenette. The hotel is close to the convention center, downtown attractions and Seaport Village is next door. We also had breakfast buffets included with our room - great food at Lael's. Definitely will return again - the whole family loved it.

<Title>“A must stay...great location and staff”
<Content>You could not ask for a better location.... Close to airport($11) and walking distance to Convention center, Petco park, Gaslamp restaurants (go to Nobu!) and sights...USS Midway only 2 blocks. Hotel is connected to Seaport village. It has numerous shops, sights(if you have a child be sure to take them to! balloon guy-only $3, and extremely cute), and great and inexpensive lunch spots Hotel itself is beautiful. Two towers as mentioned, so even though they are usually busy, it never seems crowded. Front desk very nice. We asked for a great view and got one, no extra fees, etc. The rooms are very nice- nice towels and linens, and robes. There is a small refrig in rooms which is especially nice for families. There is a grocery(Ralphs) a few blocks away if you need waters, wine, or milk. Staff from the front desk, housekeeping, gift shop and recreation were outstanding. Our son attended Camp Hyatt twice and the staff was welcoming. However it is the staff at the Grand Club that keeps us coming back. We have never received such hospitality, and we are from the South!! Bill Easter, Derek, Freddy, Jeff, and Jose are worth their weight In GOLD!! The evening snacks are light and delicious, desserts(cheesecake, choc-covered strawberries), breakfast, and the all day water, soft drinks and coffee machine make this perk worth the $. Top of the Hyatt is also a must. beautiful view, and a complimentary champagne toast at sunset. Children were welcomed throughout the hotel. Workout room had many machines, treadmills, etc. Pool, 2 hot tubs, fire pits Please stay here, you will not be sorry.

<Title>“Great place to stay and really great price from Priceline”
<Content>My husband and I decided to take a last minute trip to San Diego for a long weekend and Priceline offered a 4 star hotel near the Gas Lamp District for $87/night (taxes excluded). We arrived on a busy Saturday afternoon since the hotel holds a lot of conventions and we got a room on the Marina side. We had a beautiful view of the Marina and our room was not on the upgraded side, but nontheless beautiful. We were there for 3 nights and 2 of the nights they closed the main pool early because of private events but they still kept the other pool near the spa open. The gym is well-equipped and even has cold face towels soaked in either some type of aromatherapy oil like rosemary for post work-outs. The concierge was helpful in making dinner and trolley reservations. We really enjoyed our stay here being a 10 minute walk from the Gas Lamp District though cab rides were easiest. The bell hop area was nice in recommending dinner places too for the night. We would definitely stay at Manchester again. The only thing I'd request of the Marriott is to require a key to get into the elevator at night. The hotel is so large and the elevators are right by a side door where literally anybody could come in. No one did thank goodness, but security measures like that for such a large hotel are necessary for the safety of the guests. I understand they hold a lot of conventions but even if they just did after hours, like 9pm on and needing a room key to get in would be best.

Rooms are nice and clean, conference rooms are nice (though pretty typcial) and the hotel is large with several dining and shopping options. The hotel also has a large pool, and is connected across the street to the Seaport shopping area. Hotel staff was very helpful, especially when I needed help with several large boxes for the meeting I was attending. Overall, it was a great stay, and I hope to return for a personal vacation one day.

Every member of staff that we spoke to was exceedingly helpful and polite. It's the kind of place where you don't really have to worry about anything, just focus on having a great time. If there was any improvement it would be to have a bigger and more interesting pool and outdoor area but great views all around anyways Can't wait to come back to this place

We had a great view of the USS Midway, Coronodo Island, the bridge etc. The service and all of the people were great. Great shopping and resturants right next door. Catch the trolley across the street. S'mors at the firepit by the pool were the awesome. Be sure to buy your s'more kits from the deli downstairs...cheaper than roomservice. There is also a "backyard" area with football, ping pong, yard checkers, etc. GREAT PLACE FOR A FAMILY TO STAY. Great price!

<Title>“Great Location, but too expensive”
<Content>The location is the best feature here. Very convenient to all the downtown attractions; Petco, gaslamp, harbor, etc. The hotel is lovely but so expensive (parking fees, extra charges for everything) and the service is civil but not really friendly. Huge groups & conventions daily, so there is always a big crowd, long lines for check-in/out. The rooms have full beds, not queens, so for our party of three (my husband & I, our adult daughter) the bed was cramped for two. Asked about king w/ rollaway, but they charge $20 for the rollaway, which is out of line, because they do not offer any real options for three adults in one room. View spectacular, but AC in rooms weak, very hot @ night. We got a really good deal on 4 nights thru Southwest Vacations, but I would choose another hotel if paying full price.

<Title>“Hotel and Staff Fantastic”
<Content>This was a good news, not so good news visit. Check in was relatively simple. We arrived early so they "put us in the queue". They texted us when the room was ready. The only negative of check in was the bell hops lost our bags while they were waiting for our room to become available. That was a little scary but after about 10 minutes, they found them. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are clean. Food at the breakfast buffet is pretty good. The selection is great and they do an omelet station as well. The areas are clearly marked and the elevators are fast. Strangely enough, there is not any elevator music. :-) The only negative I have was housekeeping. We were out of the apartment from 8-1 and housekeeping never came. Then at 2:30 they knocked on the door and offered me towels. The next day we were gone until 3. Then took a nap and they dropped us a note informing us they did not clean the room b/c we had the do not disturb sign on. The next day, we were gone all day. When we returned to the room the bed had been made and the towels replace, but the ice bucket was not cleaned, the detailing (extra cushions), bedspread, etc. were not replaced in the room. I expect a place as high dollar as the Hyatt to make the room look "as good as new" each day and before 2 or 3 PM. That was extremely surprising to me. The concierges were always polite and informative! They even printed out our boarding passes for us. The view from room 2009 was amazing!

<Title>“Our new favorite hotel.”
<Content>For our anniversary we sprung for a high floor corner king view room. WOW, it is the best room on the property. The views were breathtaking. The room was very clean and the cleaning staff were great to us. Once we arrived, during check-in we mentioned that no we weren't there specifically for the fourth of July, that it was our 30th wedding anniversary. After check-in and while we were out to dinner, the hotel manager sent up a complementary bottle of champagne along with chocolates and chocolate covered strawberries. Amazing, this has never happened to us before and was appreciated it very much. We also got to watch the fourth of July fireworks right from our room. Yes, this is our new favorite place to stay in San Diego. The trolley stops right in front of the hotel making getting around easy and fun. The breakfast buffet is the best hotel breakfast buffet we've had. Very good and lots of selections to choose from. It also includes an omelet bar.

<Title>“Overbooking is the norm here”
<Content>Unless you have to stay here I would warn you to stay away. This hotel routinely overbooks their rooms as part of their business model. I came here as it was the location for an industry conference i was attending. They were way overbooked and sent me and many other guests to another hotel over 15 minutes away. After discussions with various hotel employees it was clear this is a common happening. Even though my room was comped I resent the huge inconvenience and being deliberately taken advantage of so the Hyatt can insure 100% occupancy. The staff was generally helpful but the property is worn and needs refurbishment. Meeting planners beware!

<Title>“Great hotel - can't wait to visit again.”
<Content>My boyfriend and I spent the weekend at the Manchester Grand Hyatt for our anniversary. I love this hotel. Our room was perfect with an amazing view of the harbor. Parking is a bit on the high side ($26/day for hotel guests) and the drinks at the bar are also over priced but it was ok to splurge once in awhile. The room was clean and simply decorated. As with any hotel, we could hear road noise (even 20 floors up) but not enough to keep us up at night. The lobby is impressive and their ballrooms are massive. Wifi was included (for platinum members) but we didn't have a need for it as we have our phones. Seaport Village is right behind the hotel and it was great to just walk around at night and enjoy what San Diego has to offer. We spent the day in Coronado and the evenings in SD. Top Of The Hyatt is a definite must see. The service could have been better though - it took forever for the bartender to take our order and he wasn't even busy. The bartenders at the lobby-level bars are much friendlier. They had live entertainment in the evenings which was nice to listen to while we enjoyed our drinks. We didn't have an opportunity to visit the firepit near the pool area but I was told they have smores for guests. We will definitely be back again for another weekend getaway. It's like going on vacation without leaving the city!

<Title>“Terrible service. Wedding hiccups and erroneous charges.”
<Content>My sister got married here in April with a ton of hiccups by the event staff. The on-site event planner showed 20 min late to the ceremony because she forgot to set-up the sand ceremony. She was supposed to escort the bride and bridal party to the lawn where the ceremony was going to be held, so we ended up heading to the lawn ourselves when we hadn't heard from her and she hadn't returned any of our calls. The reception also did not go smoothly. The event planner was nowhere to be found at the start of the reception when we needed assistance with missing tables/chairs. Extreme lack of management. After all that, I noticed several incorrect charges on my credit card from the hotel. I checked into one room that evening but was charged for two other rooms (one of my sister's and one of my brother in-laws) for one night before the wedding and one night after, which I was not present at check-in nor did I ever leave my card for. When I called the hotel about these incorrect and unauthorized charges, they couldn't explain why they took the authority to charge the two additional rooms to my credit card and said that they would transfer the charges over to the correct cards. That was in April. It's now July and they still have not done so. When my sister called them to straighten this out, they said our case had been closed. They closed the case with out resolving it or transferring the charges. The employee apologized to my sister and said she would fix it with in the week, so that I would not be incorrectly charged. That was weeks ago and the charges still remain on my card. I am extremely dissatisfied with the level of service and the staff's inability to correct their mistakes, especially when my sister spent thousands of dollars here for her wedding. I would NEVER stay here again or recommend this place to anyone.

<Title>“Needs refurbishment and new staff!”
<Content>As a Hyatt Gold Passport member I was hugely disappointed with our family's stay at this property. Outside of hotel and lobby gives you the feel of hotel majesty, then you speak with a staff member or (gulp) walk into your room and release you've been duped! Staff is indifferent at best, consistently incompetent, and confrontational if you complain. Valet guys have no idea about things in their city like "How far is the San Diego Zoo? Can we walk? Cab? Or do we nee to drive?" A quick poll of 3 valet guys and you are searching your iPhone for Google to find out what is going on! Rooms are in dire need of an update from worn colors everywhere, huge stains on carpets, and cracked and broken bathrooms (tiles, counters, walls). The breakfast is terrible quality and has a meager selection of hot foods. Good thing it was included in my room rate, otherwise I might have been arrested after I got the bill! Don't ask for an omelet it will be burnt I guarantee! The pool is way too small for the amount of people at the hotel and your experience will be an uncomfortable stress rather than relaxing fun.

<Content>My daughter, mother-in-law, and I flew to San Diego to enjoy a few days taking in the tourist attractions. Unfortunately my daughter got very sick soon after our arrival. The front desk was amazing in arranging taxis to and from the hospital. When we returned to our room later the next day, there was a beautiful fruit basket and a get well card waiting for us - all compliments of the front desk staff. I was blown away by their caring attitude. Although we didn't get to see much of San Diego this time, I would without a doubt stay at the Manchester Grand Hyatt the next time we visit. I also want to mention the delicious breakfast buffet and friendly concierge. Definitely a 5-star hotel in my opinon!

<Content>We(2 adults, one 8 year old child) have been to San Diego numerous times and typically stay north of downtown in La Jolla or Del Mar. However this year we really wanted to enjoy the water on and around the city in San Diego Bay. We could not have picked a better hotel. The location is perfect for exploring all the downtown attractions as well as the water activities. Along with the cute Seaport Village, there is a beautiful marina and oceanfront sidewalk directly out the back doors of the hotel. We were on the 23rd floor and the views were amazing. The room was good sized and furnished very well with a huge flat screen TV. Be sure to ride the elevator up to the 40 floor and check out the view from there... see picture. The pool and deck is really nice, a bit crowded but it was the 4th of July weekend. Perhaps adding a lazy river or water-slide for the kids would be nice addition to the hotel. They do have an adults only pool, but did not venture over there on this trip. We did not eat at the hotel so cannot comment on that or the spa. The only issue we had was that the self parking was kind of expensive at $27 per night but typical for an urban hotel I suppose. Also, the self parking was full on two of the three nights we stayed, but they valet parked us for no additional charge. Overall we felt this was a great luxury hotel. Enjoy!

<Title>“Not as "grand" as it thinks it is”
<Content>All the grandeur in this hotel is in the lobby. I attended a three-day conference and stayed on for three more days of family vacation. At a conference for 2000+ people, they set out a continental breakfast buffet and provided no place to sit except on the steps leading to the conference rooms. Traveling with our grand-daughter, we needed two beds, so reserved the "premium view double." Okay, the view was wonderful, but the two beds were tiny, and we had to move furniture around to be able to get in and out of one of them climbing over a chair. As noted previously, NOTHING is included at this hotel: we had to beg on a daily basis for sufficient towels and washcloths, water is $4.50 for a small bottle of nothing special, Internet is $10 and up per day, parking is $26 a day, and should you go to the pool and want a bit of shade, there are no umbrellas, but they will be glad to reserve a cabana for you at $75 for a HALF day! This is a great location - but with hotels on every corner for as far as the eye can see, there have to be better choices!

<Title>“not a great value at all”
<Content>This is a very nice, large Hyatt property down on the waterfront in San Diego. Like many Hyatts, the price is quite high for what you get. I had stayed the previous 2 days at Loews in Coronado which provided a great comparison. The Hyatt room was about the same price, but smaller, noisier and had a less comfortable bed. Room service was slow and expensive, as was the high speed internet. The staff was very helpful and comp'd drinks to make up for the noisy room. Overall, this is not the best venue in the area, but not a bad hotel at all.

<Content>We stayed here for a night and couldn't be happier with the location. Staff was very nice and helpful. Lots of activities for the kids. The weather was a little chilly so we put the hot tubs that overlook the bay to good use. The kids enjoyed the game area as well. We took advantage to the firepits by bringing everything needed to make smores. The kids loved it! Public transportation is accessible and there are a lot of options nearby. Would definately stay here again!

<Content>This is a fantastic hotel with easy access to the gaslamp quarter and adjoining seaport village. I have stayed here in 2010 as well when we were here for a conference. Depending on the tower you can get really nice views of the harbor or the coronado bridge. The service is wonderful as well as the amenities including the health club.

<Content>Really enjoy this hotel. Friendly front desk staff, fast elevators, free internet (b/c of platinum status), pretty view of the harbor from my room, walking distance to the convention center and the Gas Lamp district. Only a few drawbacks but I can get over them - the guest room hallway areas (carpet and wallpaper) seems tired and could use a refresh; Lael's breakfast is a bit on the expensive side; Harbor lobby bar area serves food but no desserts :(

<Title>“Not living up to its potential”
<Content>This hotel is in a great location right on the bay near the Gaslamp District. However, it does not live up to its potential or price tag. The decor is out-dated. They don't give you bathrobes unless you call the front desk and ask for them. They charge over $10 a day for internet. Laels restaurant charges $18 for a continental breakfest. Self-parking is $25 per night. A small bottle of water in the room is over $4. Room service is slow. Our toilet had a leak and made noise all night. The people in the next room partied until 2:30 am. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived so the check in clerk promised to text us when it was ready -- he never did. The Manchester Grand Hyatt could be so much better, especially for the premium price they charge. But they nickle and dime you. So after 4 nights and $1,300, we left feeling we didn't get good value for what we paid. I've never been a big fan of Hyatt, and this experience has done little to change. that.

<Title>“Wonderful Location”
<Content>I spent four days attending a professional convention. I found the hotel very functional. It is situated within walking distance to the convention center and downtown (about two miles). The rooms were clean. We had a beautiful view of the harbour. We were upgraded to Club level and had a daily good buffet breakfast with fresh fruit, delicious pastries, juices, fruits and lox and bagels. The two receptions by the pool were lavish, despite the cold weather, of course not the fault of the hotel .. In sum this is great hotel, well kept with good service and excellent food..

Our rooms had a fabulous view of the bay, and the champagne and snacks in the bar at the top of the hotel were really reasonably priced and worth it for the view. A hotel of this calibre and cost shoulld have free wifi though!

<Content>I am sorry but, I am going on brake, To print that will cost you $3.00 that two bottles of Beer will only be $30.00 delivered to your room. I travel for business a lot. My employer wants me to be focused on the task at hand not worried about being nicked and dimed. My room was clean, but every day just before 8am house keeping knocked on the door, I don’t know why as they do not give you new towels unless you ask for them. The views from the hotel were great, but the staff just trashed my 5 day trip. My company books over 1200 room night a year, I will drive the extra miles not to stay at a Hyatt, This seems to be a corporate culture I would also recommend not having your conference at that location they can not handle it.

<Title>“Big hotel; Good service.”
<Content>I stayed here for the San Diego Rock & Roll Marathon. At check in, I was really happy to hear the hotel was offering a shuttle bus ($10) to the start line since I hadn't yet figured out how I was going to get there! Great location---about a 10 minute walk to the Gaslamp & the Convention Center. I walked back to the hotel several nights from the Gaslamp and always felt safe. My room was in the Seaport Tower. The room was clean, standard Hyatt with mini-fridges, so you can stock up on drinks and snacks at Ralph's near by. Not sure what the rooms in the other tower look like. The pool at the Seaport Tower is family-friendly. If you don't want to be around kids, there is an adults-only pool in the other tower. Only issue for me was wifi isn't free.

<Title>“Corner King Rooms, Amazing View!”
<Content>Get the corner king room. Windows from floor to ceiling times 3. The windows all open to allow the ocean breeze to fill your room. Large TV with real HD channels. There is a fridge in the room and a grocery store within 7 minute walk to save you money on beers, pops, and bottled water. It's a short walk to Gaslamp. Eat breakfast at Richard Walker's, it's a 5 minute walk. Cheaper and better than the hotel. I researched a lot before deciding on a hotel for this trip. This was a perfect choice.

<Title>“Too big for its own good”
<Content>Hotel chains seem to be moving in the same direction as airlines. Once good brands now leave much to be desired. This is one of those mega-hotels that is so crowded the staff can't possibly keep up. I requested a king bed and got a room with two double beds instead. As noted in previous reviews, if you get a room with an adjoining room, you can hear everything that goes on in there. I immediately asked to move and was given a choice of a smoking room, or a "parlor suite". I chose the parlor suite, which was actually a meeting room, with a cot wheeled in. I asked to switch the next day and got a regular room. For the trouble, I was given a free breakfast, but they still billed me for the tip. My colleague arrived the same evening and was told there was no room available for her, despite a confirmed reservation. She and her family were also given a meeting room with wheeled in cots. They found the front desk staff to be very unhelpful. There are always long lines for the front desk and the concierge. Every time I called the desk, I got a recording saying all operators are busy, please continue to hold. Same when calling for laundry service, same for room service and same for a wake-up call. When I got to speak to the operator about the wake up call, she tried to sell me breakfast. Personally, I'd prefer to skip the sales pitch and have my call answered right away. Fees are high as they usually are in these kinds of places. $4.50 for a bottle of water, $16.99 for an in-room movie, $38 for three days of wireless (which they did agree to refund). Incidentally, before you pay for wireless, see if you can access a free network. I did that on the last night after my three days ran out and got it for free. (A previous post on here about having to pay for news channels is not accurate.) I emailed the manager who responded to previous posts on here and also got a reply from the rooms manager. They were helpful and agreed not to charge me for the night on the cot. But in the end, this is not what you'd expect from a Hyatt. And it cannot be recommended.

<Title>“Nice, but Nicks You for Everything, and the Bathroom is Lacking”
<Content>This is a nice hotel, and the staff is great. It has a good location close to the Gaslamp District. However, the additional charges for everything are really too much --$4.50 for a bottle of water in your room, $13 per day for the slow Internet service (which is good for only one device), etc.., etc.. Less expensive hotels offer these and other amenities for much less or nothing. Also, the quality of the bathroom is not what one would expect of a hotel in this price range.

<Title>“Your basic Hyatt”
<Content>This hotel definitely lived up to the Hyatt reputation- clean rooms, professional service, great pool, large grounds, etc. My only complaint was that they charge for the business centre usage and for wireless. You'd think if you're paying a premium to stay at the Hyatt that they'd let you use the computer for free. Also, being in my early 30s, I would probably stay in the Gaslamp district (about a 10 minute walk) next time I visited San Diego... More nightlife, action, etc... We took cabs into the area every night. On the other hand, the bay area where the hotel is located is nice and quaint, if that's what you're looking for.

<Title>“Lovely view of the bay”
<Content>Stayed here for 3 nights and had a great time. We had a room overlooking the bay and the USS Midway which was lit up at night and even had fireworks one night. The rooms were quite big, although the connecting door was a nuisance, as on our last night we went to bed early as had a 4am wake up call and the family in the next room were very loud when they came back. Easy walking to the Gaslamp district where there a great choie of bars and restaurants. Beside hotel is Seaport Village with lovely shops and eateries, its very pretty and nice just to sit and have an ice cream. The reception staff were all very helpful and the bar staff were very friendly and corteous. Have a drink at the Top of the Hyatt, the views are spectacular towrads Coronado Island, which I would recommend visting as it is very pretty with lovely shops and restaurants. I would stay in this hotel again.

<Title>“City by the Bay...Wonderful !”
<Content>Stay in the downtown area, you can walk to everything. We walked to the Gaslamp disctrict every night for food, drinks, entertainment and people watching. That was always a fun evening for adults. The homeless people were a surprise, didn't expect to see so many, but they didn't bother you. We walked to the USS Midway for a tour which was great, Seaport Village, and we did the Trolley Tour which is a great way to see the entire city so you get a good feel for what interests you. Highly recommend that for all. We drove to the Zoo took tour behind the scenes, Safari Park went zip lining, and the many beaches. One yummy surprise was a little privately owned resturant in LaJolla named Barbrarella's, this quaint place had fantastic food and friendly service, we went there twice we liked it so much. After dinner you can walk to the beach to watch the sunset. The hotel was in a great location, but nothing special inside, kinda noisy too. All in all great trip/visit, what a beautiful area.

It was very easy to walk to a number of places. Because of the weather, we did not get to use the pool - but it looked like it had a lot of space, with an area for the kids. Overall, I'd say it is a good place to stay.

<Title>“Mediocre, over-priced”
<Content>Stayed for a conference. Hotel's location is alright but not brilliant - a short walk from the Gaslamp District which has plenty of restaurants, but not much in the hotel itself or in its immediate vicinity. First room I was given had a locked connecting door with the next room. It was entirely un-soundproof - I could hear every word of the conversation in the next room. Moved to a different room which had no connecting door. This room was perfectly adequate. The only problem was the rolled blanket at the foot of the bed, which had an enormous, disgusting stain on it. I asked for it to be changed. When I returned to the room later, someone had put a second blanket on the bed, but had not removed the stained one! I was also disappointed with the service when checking-out. I had an 8.30am meeting that day, but they wouldn't give me a late check-out, even by an hour. So I had to check out before my meeting. For $220 a night I'd like a little more flexibility. They also charge for wireless access, although they waive this if you join the Hyatt Gold rewards scheme.

Room was clean with a 50 inch TV and a great view of the bay, and we especially enjoyed the breakfast buffet in the hotel (can't recall the restaurant name). Location is right next to Seaport Village and while a little touristy, worth checking out (some great street musicians) . San Diego zoo is about a 15 minute drive and one of the nicest zoo's I've ever visited and I'm no zoo fan! Overall a great stay and the only negative I can think of was a room service tray left in the hallway for a day.

<Content>My husband and I live in SD county. When we want to treat ourselves and stay in downtown SD for a night, we choose to stay at the Hyatt. We decided to stay downtown the night before the SD Rock N Roll Marathon. (I was running the half marathon.) I was told the hotel was scheduled to be 98% full that night. We had no problems checking in about 6:00 p.m. The hotel lobby is beautiful. We got a room was on the 28th floor with a WONDERFUL view of Mission Bay. The bed was very comfortable and the room had all of the standard amenities. The concierge desk was especially nice and helpful. If you want some tips on where to go or what to do, ask for Phillip. Also, this hotel is located right next to Seaport Village which is a great way to spend the afternoon strolling thru shops and enjoying he views. I would recommend saving your appetite for a restaurant in the Gaslamp rather than in the village. The Gaslamp is within walking distance of the hotel as well. We will be back.

<Title>“Very relaxing stay at the Grand Hyatt!”
<Content>Well first of all, when we got there for a scout conference, I was unsure about the hotel because of some of the reviews on trip advisor. I was in for a nice surprise! The check-in lady was really nice and pleasant, and the parking ticket wasn't as much as some of the reviews said it would be! I asked the lady if we could have a bay-view room, and she gave us one without even charging extra, and we had a perfect view of seaport village and the battleship! Besides that, the grand mall was only a 10 minute walk away! The pool was clean, and the jacuzzis were outstanding! Also, the poolside snack bar had awesome bartenders, and the waitresses were very nice! The showers were a little dirty, but hey, what can you expect from a shower that has been used before! The beds, were a different story, as for falling asleep on them was like sleeping on a rock! The restataraunts in seaport village were very pricy, but for good service and food! Back to the rooms, they were very nice, and there were no "stains" on the floor. The housekeeping lady provided good service and cleaning, as the same with room service! Overall, I would definitely recommend this if you want a relaxing stay in San Diego, California!

<Title>“Good for business”
<Content>I will admit that my company paid for my room here, so I can't assign value as well as others who paid themselves. This is a huge hotel, and there are often several business conventions and events going on at once. My room was nicely updated, and included a fridge, safe, blow dryer, iron, and plenty of towels and toiletries. The bed was really comfortable. The flat screen TV was nice, but not user-friendly. Internet and parking are way too expensive here, as are the dining options. The location is great, and allows you to easily walk to the gaslamp district, convention center, USS Midway, and the Maritime Museum. Staff always seemed very professional. I will say that the food and service provided for our convention were excellent, and everything seemed to go very smoothly. For business purposes this hotel is a good choice, but due to all the excess charges and high fees, I wouldn't recommend this place for your typical family vacation or fun getaway.

<Title>“Amazing Hotel!”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the MGH last September and had chosen it for it's location. It is central to many atractions such as Petco Park (10 min walk), USS Midway (10 min walk), La Jolla (30 min by car), Humphreys by the Bay for a Beach Boys concert (20 min cab) and SD Zoo (20 mins by bus). The hotel is immaculate and our room 1808 had amazing views of the Bay and a very comfortable king size bed. Daily maid service was excellent. Check in and check out were quick and easy...special kudos to Leah (fellow Canuck...yay!) for her professional, efficient and friendly ways. Pool area is fantastic but watch out for daily parking fees upwards of $35.00 and daily WI-FI of around $13.00. Laels for breakfast buffet was over the top in terms of selection and quality. Try and get this included in your package as we did. All hotel staff were courteous and accomodating including the consciege desk which was always manned and ready to provide local information. Overall a great place to hangout in a lovely, clean and safe city...we will be back! Well done MGH!

<Title>“Wonderful Stay”
<Content>I stayed at the Manchester Hyatt for two nights to attend a business meeting at the hotel. I was checked in by a truly charming young man. My room was in the Harbor Tower; very nice view. The king bed room was spacious and clean and the bed was comfy. The location right on the harbor makes many restaurants and attractions walkable. The hotel food was excellent and the sushi at Sally's was wonderful as well. My only complaint, and it is minimal, is that the air dryer in the room didn't work, but it took over 20 min for them to bring up a replacement. Kind of set me back on schedule and promoted a bad hair day. These kinds of things are minor and I would definitely stay again!

<Title>“Nice Hotel in a traditional Hilton Style”
<Content>Stayed three nights. Small issue with my checkin (lack of communication from Orbitz .... urgh), eventually sorted. The room was nice, well laid out, though our room faced Petco Park, the lower portion of the CBD and a Trainline - Train was audible from the room. Pool was good, although Child-filled on a Saturday Night at 8pm (where the hell were the parents?) Concierge desk were Brilliant! Helped us book a tour to Ensenada and guide us up to Hillcrest to meet freinds. All in all a good stay.

<Title>“Grand Pool!”
<Content>Can't believe they have 1600 room here between 2 towers! Huge complex and many meeting rooms too. Came with my husband for the SANS convention that he attended while I relaxed. Even though there were a block of rooms to be held we didn't get into this hotel the first 2 nights (stayed across the street and then transferred over). Not sure why it was so overbooked - probably due to other conventions here. Even though the SD Convention Center is just a few blocks south - MGH holds many conventions themselves. The rooms are very basic but nice (no king option for the block that was held for our convention), there are other amenities that make up for the basic rooms. The pool is wonderful - you feel like you are at the Bellagio on Vegas. It over looks Seaport Village and the harbor. Off in the distance is Coranado Island and the bridge. The work-out room is huge and amble machines and free-weights. The treadmills face outward windows overlooking SanDiego Harbor. Picture perfect! We are going to check out the bar on the 40th floor tomorrow night with friends and I am sure the views will be breathtaking. The lobby is "Grand" by all accounts. No free breakfast but great location - pool - workout rooms and meeting spaces (probably wonderful wedding options). It's in a sweet spot and worth staying at!

<Title>“It was fine”
<Content>First let me say that the view from our room was amazing. The hotel is in a great location with beautiful scenery. This hotel was very odd because some of their employees were very nice and accommodating while others are just rude. The room service people were very nice and brought my daughter a complimentary scoop of ice cream and the cleaning lady was also very courteous. The bartenders in the hotel lobby were unprofessional jerks. We paid for valet both nights that we were there and because we weren’t in a porche the valet was less than helpful. I think if I pay 10 bucks extra to park, then you can open my door and help me with my stroller. Instead when they got our truck they parked it about a hundred yards from us and then we had to go ask for the keys to it. That’s not valet. The lobby of this hotel is beautiful. The room was fine, they were clean and the beds were comfy. The pool and the Jacuzzi were dirty. The jacuzzi was luke warm and smelt badly. However, the pool does have an amazing view. I also used the wifi, which worked well but it cost $13 a day. I thought charging for wifi was really just cheap and classless of the hotel, seriously McDonalds gives its guest free wifi.

<Title>“Bingo”
<Content>I spent days looking at all the reviews for San Diego area hotels in search of a place to spend a few days away from the Portland rain. It was agonizing trying to choose between which area to visit and which hotel to stay at. I picked the Manchester and crossed my fingers and........it was great. We received a nice room, the staff was on the ball, and the location was perfect for a non-family, non-Sea World/Zoo, long weekend. I guess we got lucky and rcvd a "corner-king" which overlooked the bay (and air craft carrier Midway) and the downtown area. The Manchester’s location makes it an easy walk to the Gas Lamp area and shopping as well. We didn’t have a car, so a few taxi rides were needed to get to Old Town for dinner (worth the trip) and to/from the airport ($12.00 each way). We rented bikes and took the ferry to Coronado Island one day and completely enjoyed ourselves. The hotels’ pools (one adult only) were clean and just what we were looking for. All in all, I totally recommended the Manchester.

<Title>“Great Hotel Stay”
<Content>I cannot say enough about the service that my boyfriend and I receive at the Manchester Hyatt San Diego. We stayed at the Manchester Hyatt in November and went back for the Easter Holiday (April 22-24, 2011). Thanks to the Hyatt we were able to have the same suite from our November trip; we really enjoyed the room and the San Diego sites. The room has great with the ocean views and flat screen TV in our bed room. We plan to go back soon because we enjoy the Hotel and the service that we received.

<Title>“Surprised at the service level of this convention hotel!”
<Content>A friend of mine was attending a conference for the week at the Manchester Grand Hyatt during the first weekend in April. I decided to meet her in San Diego and stay with her. She attended her conference in the mornings and we met up each afternoon. This was my first trip to San Diego, not to mention California. Being from the Midwest, I wondered what CA would be like...all I've seen are the TV shows portraying extremes from the rich and the fabulous to lifelong hippies. This hotel helped make my stay in SoCal very satisfying. This hotel was a very quick 10 minute trip from SAN airport. Cabs were easy to find and the moment I stepped out of the cab, I was greeted by a hotel staff member opening the door for me and directing me inside the lobby. I wasn't expecting this and didn't have a tip ready, but I honestly don't think he expected one, he was all smiles and professional looking in his suit. I arrived before my friend did and had no issues checking in because we'd made the proper arrangements since her company was paying for the room and I was staying with her. The girl who checked me in was kind and courteous and answered all of my questions without rushing. She welcomed me to California and provided a room with a nice view. In walking to my room, I could see just how huge this hotel was. Many meeting rooms, large and small. There were several events going on at one time. The hotel public areas were always full of people and busy which made the hotel feel alive. There were two separate elevators - one for the lower level rooms and one for the higher floors. I can't lie and say I mistook the two a couple of times, no one's fault other than my own. The floors were quiet and traditionally tasteful. Our room was a typical hotel room with two double beds, nothing fancy, but it was comfortable. Only thing I'll note about the room and floors is that I felt trays sat outside of rooms in the hallways for a rather long time - breakfast trays were still in the hallways when it was almost dinnertime. I do know that the guests should call down though to let them know to pick up the used trays. After I checked in, I went to explore. I came from Chicago weather to San Diego weather - it was amazing. I checked out the fitness room so I knew where it was, and found the locations of the ATM, gift shop and pools. Then I ventured out the back door to find myself right in the middle of the touristy Seaport Village on the San Diego Harbor. Yes, touristy, but it was nice to have a place to walk and browse shops after my flights. There were tons of souvenir shops, many places to eat, even a Ben and Jerry's and a small cute cupcakery. This hotel is in a perfect location for this. I came down one morning to walk around the harbor and you can find other walkers and runners in the area. I especially liked the little shop selling organic/natural/local soaps and other toiletries. On my way back, I made a reservation at a seafood house for my friend and I and headed back to the hotel for a quick workout before my friend arrived. I really liked the workout room. It felt like a fitness center. It wasn't huge - most of the room was made up of Cybex type stations. But they did have a row of 10 treadmills and 6 elliptical machines and a small space for stretching. Also 3-4 stationery bikes. Some of the bikes and ellipticals overlooked the harbor and that was quite nice. The machines were of high quality and each had its own TV screen which I don't care to use, but a nice touch. There were plenty of towels, a fancy water cooler and even refrigerated cloths for your post-workout refreshment. I enjoyed running and ellipticalling watching the harbor! I noticed there were even locker rooms - I think there is some sort of private fitness club you can be a member of but didn't look much into it. The women's locker room had a bathroom with showers and sauna/steam rooms. I had to ask for directions quite a bit here. No matter where I went in the hotel, the staff was always well-dressed and they'd always smile at me or somehow acknowledge me and that is AWESOME for a hotel of this size. Sometimes the huge hotels have trouble with personal service. Even the housekeeper saw me coming back from the fitness center one morning of my stay and asked if I was sure I didn't need service. I'm pretty low maintenance and was only there a few days...I used the same towel each day and typically bring my own toiletries. She insisted that I take a couple extra towels just in case...in a polite way, so I did. The pool decks here are a treat. There is a huge 7th floor family pool deck with beds to lay out, the pool, and two small hot tubs. Each day, I found some time to lay out and soak up the sun...I preferred to be away from most people (kids..that is), so I pulled up a lounger next to one of the hot tubs and soothed away. One day they were closing the main pool deck for an event, and a worker told me about the "spa" pool on the 3rd floor. This is a smaller deck which you need your key for and is 21+ only. YEAH! I did spend a couple hours one late morning on this deck reading a magazine. We used the concierge services a few times and were very satisfied. We loved Phillip from Michigan - he was awesome. He had a band-aid when I hit my leg on one of the workout machines, gave us earplugs for the concert we were attending, and offered us discounted car rental service to a venue we were headed to. He told us to be careful and to check back with him the next day to make sure we were okay, as we'd be getting back from Solana Beach pretty late. We waved at him the next day and he shouted out, "thanks for checking in, looking great, ladies!". I'm sure he does this for all the ladies but it made us feel special in a lobby full of people...and it showed he cared. Instead of running, I decided to check out one of the hotel restaurants for breakfast my last morning there, called Lael's. They had a breakfast buffet which was about $25. I'm not a heavy eater, but I felt it was totally worth it. From the nice table settings, to our nice server - I forgot his name but he was from Peru - to the fact that cream cheese and lox was available. I'm not a meat eater so it was really awesome that I could have an egg white omelet and some lox/cream cheese/capers for breakfast with fruit and a splurge on a blintz, complete with berries and sweet whipped cream. But for the meat eaters, they had tons of good looking bacon and sausage too. Typically, when I travel, I wouldn't pay those kind of rates on a room - I typically go for mid-size, mid-price...but the company paid for this room and I enjoyed the stay immensely. If I'm ever in the area again, I'd definitely try to stay here. As huge as it was, I felt like it was an oasis on the San Diego harbor. This hotel is also within easy walking distance of the Convention Center, the commuter train terminal (if you're headed up the coast to Solana Beach, etc) and to the Gaslight downtown district with tons of restaurants and shops.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>I stayed two nights when I was in San Diego for a professional meeting and was very pleased. The room was large and well above average in quality. I couldn't get the room safe to work, and they sent somebody to fix it right away. The hotel is well-located by the convention center and across the street from the red car line for easy transportation. Hotel parking was very convenient. They charge for internet access in the room. When I made the reservation, T-Mobile was still listing this as a Hotspot. As I have an account, that was an advantage. But when I checked in, I learned the T-Mobile hotspots had been disconnected.

<Title>“A great place to view San Diego”
<Content>We stayed 3 nights in a Conference Suite (upgrade request at time of booking). The suite was enormous and had a full dining suite, kitchen, and a murphy bed. The actual beds in the main room were small though - we are used to a Queen and really noticed the difference in the double. Bathrooms were well sized and towels etc were good quality. There was however lots of dust on the tv table, the side cabinet in the dining room, etc so more attention to detail needed. We tried to connect through to the Concierge on 4 occasions, and kept getting the operator - easier to go down to the lobby for assistance. The pool itself in the Sea Tower is very tiny relative to the size of the sunbaking area. So lots of people in a small pool and it isnt enjoyable. Plus the ground around the pool is sticky from people spilling drinks, etc. The coffee shop was good for breakfast - Carol Ann's. The Business Center was closed early, so we had to use the alternate computer for USD6.95 for 15 minutes!!! which is outrageous considering most hotels offer for free these days. But we were informed that the Business Center would also charge that rate. The Fitness Center is fantastic - great equipment and a view over the harbour. Self parking expensive at USD26 per night - honestly, why?? Oh, and our huge gripe - "Do Not Disturb" signs on all our doors, yet the maid bursts in on the first morning to ask what time we will be going out - not acceptable!! Rooms are quite peaceful except for the freight trains through the night. Overall we would recommend and stay again. The Top of the Hyatt is definately worth it for a cocktail or two!

<Title>“Friendly and helpful staff - the hotel itself, not terrible, but should be better for the price”
<Content>The hotel is well-located and has a nice "pretty" lobby in the traditional sense, however there were some quirks with the room. My television wasn't working properly and I had to call three times to finally get someone to come take a look at it. When a tech came he said that they'd recently updated the cable service, and something hadn't been properly programmed or installed on the television in my room. This meant that I didn't get many channels for two days until they were finally able to fix it. The deadbolt lock on my door also kept sticking. A few times I had to jiggle it for a few minutes before I could pen the door. I know I'll probably take some heat for this, but I resent the fact that you must specifically call the front desk to notify the staff if you want fresh towels. There was a tiny, almost unnoticeable card on the end of the vanity in the bathroom mentioning this. I don't mind reusing towels, but it should be easier to request fresh towels if they're needed. The system in place in most hotels of "towels in the bathtub = to be replaced, towels hung up = to be reused", is much easier and preferable, in my opinion. The staff was pleasant, and the concierge staff particularly was very friendly and helpful with restaurant recommendations. I had a good stay, but for the price the hotel could be better.

<Title>“5*** Customer Service!”
<Content>This review is for the customer service received from Pedro at the front desk! I'll make this brief.... Family traveling with a 1 year old and a 5 year old and have just completed a fantastic stay with the hyatt in Huntington beach. My husband is attending a conference at the Hilton bayfront a few blocks away. After receiving HORRIFIC customer service and cancelling our reservation on the spot, we were left wondering what are we going to do now??? I had my husband load the entire tiny rental back up and said we are headed to the hyatt and hopefully they can find a room... ANY ROOM. Basically in my mind thought I would potentially be at the mercy of front desk staff and was abit nervous... Thats when we met Pedro. He listen to my story and desperation. He told us not to worry and worked his magic to find us an AMAZING room complete with kitchen with breakfast! all for a great rate! Above all Pedro saved our family 6 days of complete madness and turned a extremely stressful situation back around to wonderful. This in itself is truely priceless. Bottomline if your still reading.... the hyatt loyalty program works as it should for us that travel and hilton has missed the mark by FAR!! again. Pedro if you read this God Bless you!

<Title>“Nice business hotel.”
<Content>I stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt for a conference and had a nice time. Had I stayed there for a vacation and paid out of my own pocket, I may feel differently about my review. The common areas of the hotel were wonderful but most of my negatives center around the room itself. First, the carpet in my room had stains in several places. I recognize that the hotel is older and that, since I was paying the conference rate, I probably didn’t get one of the nicer rooms, but multiple stains just make the room look not fresh and not clean. Second, I had a few issues with housekeeping. My expectation is that new hotel size shampoo and conditioner will be provided at least every other day (although really it should be every day). I shouldn’t run out of shampoo after three days in the hotel. Another thing about which I am particular is the ice bucket; upon arrival, I filled the ice bucket (and bag) with ice. Of course, the ice melted overnight; my expectation was that it would be emptied and another bag be provided. Neither of these occurred. A final issue is that the rooms are not sound proofed very well. The first night I was awoken at 3 am by the next room blasting music; I called the front desk and this was taken care of promptly. However, on subsequent nights, I could clearly hear the phones ringing and people moving about in neighboring rooms. In truth, my quality of sleep for the entire trip was not good. On to the positives! The location is quite good; it is immediately adjacent to Seaport Village and near the convention center (not as close as the Marriott which is immediately next door to the convention center). The front desk staff are wonderful as are the restaurant staff. I ate at Sally’s, AnneMarie’s, Lael’s, the Lobby Bar, and Redfield’s while I was there. All were good and the service was wonderful. Internet and fitness center access were included with the conference rate: wifi was quick and the fitness center was nice. I also tried Kin Spa. They have monthly specials and I tried a facial and body treatment. The locker room was a bit small as mentioned in other reviews. The facilities otherwise and the staff were all wonderful. Yes, it was pricey but I expect that at a resort hotel. I would definitely recommend Kin Spa.

<Title>“Not the best Hyatt”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel few times while attending meetings at the convention center – to be honest, I stay at this place because my company books us here (because of good group rate) otherwise I would’ve either picked the Marriott or the Hilton next door – this is definitely not the best Hyatt I stated at. First of all, the carpeting in the room and the hall way needs to go – every time I see it I feel like I’m in a cheap motel. Also, everytime someone close the door, you can feel the wall shake. The walls are not thick enough to keep you from hearing the people in the next room. Also, they really need to add a Starbucks or café where guests can grab quick breakfast. The staffs are very helpful though!

<Title>“Not a good value”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel because my husband was attending a conference here. There is no doubt it is "pretty" inside, the location is not bad, and the Seaport Village is fun, but there are more cons than pros. First, though my husband's employer booked the hotel in February, we were told they did not have a room for us the last day. Over 40 floors of rooms and we are attending a conference there and they don't have a room for us the last day? Second, the parking, which was already crazy at $24, had gone up to $26 by the time we got there. Third, paying for the internet. I called the concierge desk to ask if there was anywhere nearby I could get free wifi. The person was polite, but over-used my name as she answered my questions. Annoying. Fourth, $25 a day to use the gym. Fifth, no information about the pool. I had to go see if it was free and if there was a hot tub and what time it closed. Fortunately, it was "free" and there was a hot tub. Sixth, yes, there are restaurants, as well as room service. All expensive. This hotel brags that it meets all your needs. Only if you are willing to pay for them, apparently. Seventh, the room doors slam really hard and are not only loud, but when the neighbors leave, it rattles the walls. The water coming out of the sink smelled very strongly of sulfur. One good thing: we had been booked for a double and asked if there was a queen or king available because a double is not really long enough for my husband and they did put us in a king room. I would not stay here again, though.

<Title>“Go Back It is a trap---”
<Content>A very tired hotel -- dated, and expensive. They did have a brand new flat screen in the room, but it was nearly impossible to find the "free" cable channels. Everytime we turned around they were trying to get into our wallets. In this day and age, when internet is free at the motel 6,m Hyatt wants $13.00/day. The towels looked like they borrowed them from the motel 6. Really a bad value, even at 1/2 off.

<Title>“Nice hotel but Hyatt should fix it up!!”
<Content>The lobby is most impressive and most of the staff are nice but the rooms - terrible. I walked in and thought I had walked into a cheap highway hotel, not a Hyatt. The desk had water stains all over it, the bed was most uncomfortable - which by the way I had to wait till 4 to check in - and the shower!! Whenever I took a shower you could hear the pipes groaning - awful and loud. I was here for a conference and heard multiple complaints about rooms. The housekeeping staff need to be better trained - guests can tell when a room is not clean!

As soon as anyone I spoke with (expect one gentleman on the night before our stay) found out we booked through hotwire they changed their attitude and began to talk down to us, as though we were all of a sudden less important. I will never stay there again.

<Title>“Location Location Location!”
<Content>Stayed here during a convention the first week in March. From this hotel, you can walk along the beautiful downtown harbor, Seaside Village or stroll over to the historic Gaslamp District or hop on a train right across the street. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is very helpful. Basel checked us in and bent over backwards to fix a small snafu with our reservation, which was very much appreciated! Our view from the 34th floor was breathtaking and our room was clean and quiet. I only ate one meal at the hotel (a breakfast buffet) but it was fresh and delicious. The only negative about staying in this hotel is the loud train that goes by about every 3 hours during the night -- the horn is LOUD, so take ear-plugs if you are a light sleeper! (They work....) Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would highly recommend this hotel to friends or family.

<Title>“Beautiful View - Friendly Staff”
<Content>This hotel was perfectly located for all of the activities that we planned during our 4 days in San Diego. John at the front desk was very patient with us in helping pick just the right room for our stay and the room was great - the bay on one side and the view of the city on the other. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. The only disappointment was the breakfast buffet that we tried on our last day. Overpriced for the quality of food served. There wasn't much of a selection. At $24 per person, I expected more. I was buying lunch within 3 hours for the family as they didn't each much at the buffet. We should have just stuck with our continental breakfast in the Grand Club room but thought we'd treat ourselves on the last day. I am also confused because I thought that breakfast was part of my package with American Airlines. There was a distinct difference in the package offer between continental and full breakfast but go to the hotel and found that only breakfast in the grand club room was included. On a good note, the desserts / drinks in the club room at night were great while watching the basketball game. BTW: No Free Internet . . . . .who would have thought in this age!!! I haven't been to a hotel in years without free wifi and this hotel is way too nice to not offer it. The cost is already high enough without charging for internet access. Also, parking was $24 per day. I hated being nickle and dimed for every little thing!!!

<Title>“You will not get the room you reserved”
<Content>I arrived on 2/19/11 with my wife to attend the AHLA Conference and was extremely disappointed that we did not have the elegant room we were described nor the King sized bed we requested. We got twin beds and the room was next to the elevator. The sheets were very worn and dingy. The duvet was torn. The bathroom was dirty and there was some kind of cream all over the bathtub and sink. After 10 minutes, sleep was not to be gained due to the constant noise from people in and out of the elevator. After I complained, we waited a long while go ve given another room which was not much better and not convenient to our meeting since we had to travel to another bank of elevators on the other side of the hotel. The original room we stayed in was 3812 - DO NOT STAY THERE! We were then transferred to 1705 , which as I mentioned was not much better. This was the worst hotel experience I have ever experienced - Charles MacKelvie.

<Title>“Clean Room with a unbelievable view and a large flat screen tv for BB games.”
<Content>Stayed on the 30th floor overlooking marina, gas lamp area of San Diego, and Mexico in distance. Really like the 40th floor. Open to all around 3:30PM, the 40th floor has a bar, some snacks/deserts. The brie cheese plate was a very good pick. Also, the bar made a very good "Manhattan". Hung out there on two afternoons, Good place, especially on rainy day and good for picture taking due to its panoramic view. We originally had reserved a room at a hotel next door but decided to change when we noticed the staff pays attention to the Trip Advisor reviews. Housekeeping and the Engineers did a great job. Elevators worked great. Rooms were clean and in order. Public areas were in order. Reddenfields on the lobby level offers Kobe beef hot dogs that were pretty good. I'd steer clear of the chicken wings, my guess is no one in food/beverage has tried them lately or they'd be off the menu. Concierge reserved a water taxi for us one evening and we sailed to Coronado for a view of the sunset. The water taxi was on time going over and coming back. You can reserve the pick up time. Stayed about two hours. This was plenty of time for us. There is also a water taxi run by a hotel. We didn't sail on that one. It's a buck cheaper but doesn't go everywhere. Took a cab to/from airport - that will run around $15 - $16 with tip each way. Most of the cabs were "broom swept" and not very clean. A cab is your best bet if there is two or more in your group. The shuttle takes too long. We didn't leave the city - so no need for a rental car.

<Title>“You may not get the room you reserved.”
<Content>My husband and I made our reservations more than 2 months in advance of our stay on Valentine's Day weekend which also coincided with my husband's birthday. Check-in is at 3pm. By 4:30 we still did not have the KIng room we reserved and were told that it could be a few more hours before we could get our room. If we wanted, we could be put immediately in a room with two twin beds. Given that we had dinner plans at 6pm, we had to take the room. We had to sleep in separate beds on Valentine's Day. We were told it was because they couldn't get King rooms cleaned fast enough. We were told we had 10 people in front of us that needed a room at 3pm. At 430 we were told there were 15 people in front of us. This alone will keep us from ever going back to this hotel. The Marriott is next door and there are plenty of boutique hotels within walking distance of the boardwalk. The only thing they offered us was 2 free drinks while we waited. Big deal. This is a clear reflection of poor hotel management.

<Title>“Could not have asked for more.”
<Content>We stayed a weekend at the Manchester Grand Hyatt as an anniversary gift from our daughter. The property was indeed grand, and the service was personal. The room was impeccably clean. The staff--valets, housekeeping, front desk, bell staff-- understand the meaning of hospitality and deliver it with a bright, easy enthusiasm. The views were spactaular, the gym was well equipped and immaculate. The barrista in the espresso bar knows how to use an espresso machine. The location couldn't be better. Bravo, Manchester Grand Hyatt!

<Title>“Disappointed”
<Content>What a disappointment to go to a Hyatt with lousy service and dirty rooms. The first room we were in had burn marks in the carpet and red stains all over the carpet. We were moved to another room that was a bit better but the bathroom floors were dirty in the corners and it felt a bit dirty everywhere. The meals were too expensive. I just wanted oatmeal but you had to get the 25.00 plus tax buffet to get the oatmeal. Next 2 breakfasts were at Starbucks across the street. Coffee is terrible in the lounge area they say it is Starbucks but I doubt it, again go across the street. The tennis on the roof is cool and the pools are nice. They must be understaffed as they cannot be helpful and patient with customers as they service big conventions. The convention food was actual descent. If another convention is booked at this location I will stay at Marriott and walk to events down the street.

<Title>“NICE”
<Content>My keys did not open the door to the room, so after returning to the front desk, (with luggage) a replace set of keys was issued to me, which did open my 16th floor room. I was immediately disappointed to find 2 double beds instead of the King I had booked. The view of the harbor and the sailboats just outside my window was spectacular. I was set to order a sandwich from room service and even willing to pay $16.00 for a chicken breast sandwich, but refused to pay a $3.00 delivery fee to the room. I settled for a bag of chips and soda from the gift shop. I had just spent 10 hrs traveling and was more than ready to relax. The bed was top quality; the best nights sleep I have ever had in a hotel. The pool area was beyond belief, again with the excellent view of the harbor and the city. The conference rooms seemed more than ample enough to provide the needs of the conference I was attending, even with 600 people expected. The 46" flat screen TV was a treat, but the volume seemed to be stuck and didn't go quite as high as I needed to comfortably enjoy the free HBO. The hairdryer in the room did not work, though I did not have a need for it until I was showering before checkout. I am not computer savvy with wifi, but every time I wanted to log onto the internet I had to go through the process of choosing the server and reconnecting. Not a hugh deal, but inconvenient, especially since I had to pay for the service. I was told, when making my reservation, that it would be $9.95 a night unless I signed up for the gold pass, which was free. I was not offered this service and told it would be 12.95 a night, by the clerk who checked me in. When I logged onto the service I found there were three different prices and levels. The room was cleaned everday to my satisfaction, nothing personal seemed to be disturbed. Had lunch in the Lail's restuarant of the hotel which was fine. Nothing exceptional. Location was beautiful, within the bounds of Seaport Village and within walking distance of the Gaslamp district. I would stay here again, but I do think it is somewhat overpriced.

<Title>“Luxury hotel convienient to everything”
<Content>This hotel is very luxurious. This is not a Comfort Inn so it should not be reviewed as one. No, you don't get free breakfast. You are not going to get free internet (although this probably should start to be the norm) or free parking either. This is a prime real-estate location. What you are going to get are tastefully decorated and very comfortable rooms with views that are second to none. We stayed here about a year ago and I am finally getting around to the review. We booked our room through a AAA rate which included a suite and full breakfast voucher. Upon arriving, we were greeted by the expansive lobby. It is very bright, sophisticated, and beautiful. We were put into a corner suite that faced the bay on one end and the city on the other. It was awesome... With surrounding windows the view is second to none. The functionality of the room itself was also very nice... marble tile in the bathroom, very clean with all the amenities. Our king bed was very comfortable and we could sit in bed and watch huge Navy ships running back and forth down the bay. The TV was an old CRT, but with the view I can very easily excuse this lacking. The pool and the hot tub were very nice with plenty of towels, and again a very nice view. The shops near by are also a lot of fun to check out with a nice park in the middle on the grounds. We checked out Coronado Island (driving distance) and the Aircraft carrier (walking distance) near by. We visited the cocktail lounge at night and it turned out to be a lot of fun. Great drinks and appetizers with an awesome view of the city. My martini was very tasty! Breakfast is awesome! Eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, waffles, omelets, etc... Not to mention bagels with a dressing station including fresh salmon! The dining room is very elegant with great service. I would recommend splurging a bit to dine here for breakfast. All in all, an excellent experience... If I had more money we would have stayed for a week!

<Title>“Very nice. not 5 star but tremendous value”
<Content>For this great of a location at a nice hotel in a major city, I' say I received one of my best all time values. I booked Hyatt at very cheap, nonrefundable rates online and read the reviews afterwards. Seems some people were unhappy with old rooms. So I requested a new room and was accommodated on the top floor of a freshly renovated tower. Hotel has a fairly grand entry lobby. Check-in was a breeze and the agent signed me up for some "passport" program which waived my internet fees. The room was great and clean and serviceable. Large flat screen was nice, remote a bit balky. Good bed. I ordered room service several times and room service really was good.fast and the food was delicious, except for a fruit plate I ordered one morning. The fruit wasn't good but the service was. Hotel location is ideal for seeing San Diego. You are steps from the Seaport and minutes from the USS Midway. Housekeeping was the slight letdown. They never replaced the plastic bag in my ice bucket nor did they move it back to where it should be. They didn't replace the in room tea (coffee maker, coffee and tea provided in room) on my 3rd day although they replaced it the previous day. Some hotels clean out the shower/tub and replace all the little soap bottles but they didn't here, although I think it's silly to replace something that's not used up.until the stay ends. Towels were adequate but not plush. There is one annoying super quirk at the hotel: it's near a train track and when those trains roll through at night the horns are loud enough to wake the dead, even 31 floors up. At least the beds are excellent so sleep was still good and comfy My other nit is the $25/day self parking. Thats a bit over the top but other hotels in other major cities do it too. I just wish the garage wasn't so filthy, dingy and poorly lit. Really kinda gross, even by standards of other similar hotels. Overall, the value here was excellent but I got the room at less than $100/night with taxes. I've stayed in flea bags for more. Frankly, i'd have to recommend this hotel as a perfect choice for downtown San Diego if you can get the room for under $250 with taxes. Of course, you'd have to stay in one of the renovated rooms for that.

<Title>“Its fine but definitely not great”
<Content>Went for a conference - the location is good to walk to the convention center and close to walk to restaurants. It is unfortunately also perched above the traintracks. Be prepared to hear seemingly endless honks and hooting from trains throughtout the night. If the train is particularly long - the hooting goes on and on and on. The rooms are small and need to be updated. Room service is available (unfortunately) - if you try to sleep before 11pm be prepared to here room service anouncing their arrival with enough decibles to be heard anywhere on your floor. The room doors don't have good springs to allow them to close quitely. Anytime a door is closed on your floor, it sounds like a thunderclap Breakfast buffet is really good . I guess in summary - this place is OK - it just feels that at around 300 dollars a night by the time you add parking tax etc, you should be able to expect better. I would try somewhere else in San Diego if I went back

<Content>I stayed here for the CSUN Conference. I loved it so much that I am returning again this March 2011 for CSUN again. I was upgraded to a corner room with great views of downtown. Thank you Hyatt. I am confirmed to come back on March 15, 2011. The hotel restaurants were great. The roof top bar also offered spectacular views. The hotel is closest hotel to Seaport Village for shopping and restaurants. The hotel is within easy walking distance to some of the best downtown restaurants on or near 5th street. Refer to my San Diego restaurant reviews. I also used the outdoor swimming pool with great views of the ships moving though the bay. I will be back!

<Title>“Was there for work but it felt like a vacation!”
<Content>The Service Academy Career Conference (SACC) event brought me and my colleagues to San Diego and the Machester Grand for 3 days, 3 nights in August. We were lucky to have the ability to enjoy some of what San Diego and the hotel had to offer while there on business. Location: The hotel is located within walking distance to the Gaslamp District, Petco Park, and is adjacent to a small outdoor mall with restaurants and shops. You can walk or take a pedicab to just about anywhere - we only used a real cab to and from the airport and to the San Diego Zoo. Pool: The hotel has two pools - a quiet, adult pool and a general pool. We spent some time at the general pool and there were a lot of people and it was a busy place. The chairs are packed in close and get there early to get a good spot. We then took advantage to work by the adult pool and it was much quieter and more relaxing, with a lot more space and beautiful views. There is drink and food service to the pool and both chairs and little cabanas available for use. Rooms: The rooms are fantastic. The bathroom is large and the beds are comfortable. The first night we had an adjoining room with one room having a queen/king sized bed and the other two double beds and it was great. We moved down the hall for the remaining two nights and the rooms were just as good. The view was INCREDIBLE! We had gorgeous views of the marina, Petco Park, and Coranado. It was so wonderful to wake up each morning to see the ocean and the city. The one suggestion I would make is that they need to upgrade the TVs - both TVs I had were terrible, old tube TVs and one remote didn't work well. Service / Restaurants: The customer service was fantastic for both our stay and during the SACC event. We ate at the buffet breakfast and it was decent - not sure it was worth the money the company spent to have it there. The lunch for the SACC event was also okay - however, they didn't set up enough seating that we had reserved so we had some people with no place to sit and eat. The restaurant is so close to so many excellent restaurants that I highly suggest getting out and trying some of them. Overall: We had a wonderful time in San Diego and with our stay at the Manchester Grand. We enjoyed having a drink at night at the top of the hotel which offers wonderful views of the city and Coranado Island. The rooms were comfortable, the adult pool was inviting, and I look forward to returning for either work or pleasure.

<Content>I went with my family to the hotel. First of all, the bell boyys or whatever take forever to get your bags. It has elegance and all, but the walls were paper thin, and the beds were not good for sleeping in. The pool is just absoluetly disgusting, you cant see anything. They could have cleaned up all the cups in the jaccuzi from the bar. I didn't like getting half dranken beer all over my feet. The location is great, next to seaport village.

<Title>“What a view!”
<Content>We can't afford to stay at this place when we're on vacation, but, because the stay was for a conference and the conference rate was paid by our employer, and it was in close proximity to the Convention Center, we booked a room here. When we arrived, the desk clerk said, "We have a wonderful room for you, with a great view." Check-in was quick and easy. The room (1666) was nice and clean, and the view of the Seaport was spectacular. Presumably, about one quarter of the hotel's rooms have a similar view. The beds were comfy, there were plenty of pillows, the room temperature was comfortable, and the window opened a little, which is a plus. We used the room's frig, safe, free in-room coffee, iron and ironing board, TV. and fee-based wireless. There was also an iPod dock. We also made use of the fitness center (well equipped, but there were no clean headsets and a pile of "dirty" ones, and a stray used towel and water bottle scattered about) and the hot tub (no complaints there!). We had dinner one night in the hotel's sports bar, which was good, too (although the music was a bit loud). The business center was fee based, but printing boarding passes is complimentary. Very nice, but unfortunately beyond our means -- and that's the only reason we wouldn't recommend it to our friends. Best: the view. Worst: extra charge for wireless, and (boo!) it covered only one device.

<Title>“Loved it!”
<Content>We spent three nights over Christmas at the Manchester Grand Hyatt and loved it. Upon arrival we warmly greeted and check in was a breeze. We were given room #2606 in the south tower with a spectacular north view. After reading all the reviews, we were expecting a hotel with a beautiful lobby and shabby rooms, but our room was fresh, clean, bright, and spacious. The new huge flatscreen tv was nice too. I unpacked while the kids and my husband went to the pool. The closet was large and had lots of hangers. The armoire had three medium sized drawers in the centre with the room safe behind a door to the left, and a mini fridge behind a door to the right. As we were only staying for three nights I had no problem finding places for all our things, but with a family of four we might have needed more space if we were stayng longer. There were also some drawers in the nightstand between the two beds. We decided to have dinner at the hotel as we were tired after the long drive from Anaheim (well, we took the PCH starting at Newport Beach and stopped at Laguna Beach and Delmar enroute). We had returned our rental car to the airport after our week in Anaheim so wanted to stay close to the hotel our first night. We chose Redfield's sports bar in the hotel as it was casual, had a children's menu, and seemed to have a good atmosphere. Well, we liked it so much we ate dinner there the next two nights as well plus had an amazing Sunday Brunch. The serving staff were amazing (thanks Mindy) and the menu was quite varied. Our Christmas Eve dinner was Mac and Cheese for the kids and hot wings and nachos to share for the adults (plus some amazing local beer which has an obnoxious name that I can't post!). The servings were huge and yummy. The next two nights we shared salads which were also really good. The kid's burgers looked really good too. We usually avoid hotel restaurants but this one was a hit. Their Sunday Brunch was excellent too and extremely reasonable ($10 each for the buffet). My husband and son tried out the fitness facility and loved it. I swam in the outdoor pool Christmas Day evening at around 8pm for about 4 minutes and then sat in the hottub for an hour. We loved the pool area and would love to come back and use it when the weather is better. Even though the rains had stopped the weather was still very cool. Upon checking out (again, friendly professional and quick), we walked out front to catch a taxi to the airport. We were offered a ride to the airport in the large Hyatt SUV for a flat rate which was comparible to the cost of the taxi ($15 including tip) and we rode in comfort and style. The four of us no longer fit comfortably in most taxis and my kids loved the novelty of riding in a huge SUV. Overall, this hotel experience was excellent. The hotel was busy over the weekend and sometimes the wait for the elevators was long, but the public areas are lovely and our room was perfect.

<Title>“Classy Grand Hotel”
<Content>Switched to this hotel from Hyatt Mission Bay with two children (ages 10 and 6) because of the unexpected extensive rain in San Diego during December. We thought it would be better to be downtown closer to the activities - and we were not disappointed. The service here is top notch. One of the most surprising deals is in the lobby bar area - while not "budget", everything was a good value by hotel and California standards - especially the calamari. This is a huge hotel (1,600+ rooms), but very efficiently run. We had an issue with the elevator doors and within an hour there was a repairman working. The front desk staff was incredibly helpful, and we even booked an extra 3 nights. While we stayed here, there were two college football teams booked at the hotel (along with their fans). The swimming pool area may seem small for the size of the hotel, yet we always managed to get lounge chairs, a spot in a jacuzzi or the pool. There is an open pit "Smores" area near the pool. The views from the upper floors are spectacular. Breakfast buffet was expensive, but is apparently included in many of the package deals. Food quality was excellent. For those on more of a budget, there is a Ralph's Grocery Store about 4 blocks away. Each room comes with a fridge, so it's smarter to just stock up on some essentails and pay for a cab. KC BBQ is located just across the street. It's OK, but true BBQ fans will be disappointed. Things to avoid: The shopping plaza just behind the hotel is filled with over-expensive places to shop and eat. Everything here is priced as expensive or more as the hotel! We tried a $9 forgettable sandwich at Seaport Village Deli and had the absolute worst food of the vacation at Buster's Beach House (and ran up a $45 tab for 3 appetizers and sodas). We only ate at these places because we didn't want to be "stuck" in the hotel during the rain, but you are much better off eating at the hotel if in a similar circumstance. Anyone who says this is "too far" from Gaslamp is a fool. There are pedi-taxis that will take you there or it's an easy walk for anyone who has ever lived in a city.

<Title>“Beautiful views dated rooms.”
<Content>The lobby is grand and the views are hard to beat. I had a corner room in the seaport tower, it feels dated compared to newer hyatt hotels (see my review of the Hyatt Olive 8 in Seattle) It has a very '90s feel. The shower could have been bigger with a much better shower head. The bed was wonderful, but the walls are a bit thin. All in all, for the price its a great deal. The lobby will impress clients and family alike and the views of the bay are wonderfully relaxing at the end of a long day.

<Content>Spent 11 nights at this hotel. Had an amazing view on the bay, the room was nicely fitted, had a large flatscreen TV, too. However, I had the impression that the walls were a little too thin. A baby was crying in the next room and I was woken up several times at night. The horn of the Amtrak did not disturb me that much however. The bars should be given different ratings. The Top of the Hyatt was great, whereas the Redfield was lacking of nice staff. As i just wanted a beer and nothing to eat I was pretty much ignored by the waitresses. The restaurant Sally was ok, nothing more than that. Breakfast at Lael's was awesome, recommend it. The location of the hotel is great, next to Seaport Village and just a short walk to the Gaslamp Quarter. Too bad it was heavily raining the first days, so that I was forced to take a cab. Only negative point would be the parking fee of 24 bucks a night to put my motorbike there... For a car I would say ok, but for a bike? C'mon...

<Title>“Hotel is great, but the rooms are lame.”
<Content>The lobby is impressive on a grand scale, as is the rest of the hotel areas. Our room was small and average - the decor was more fitting a three star hotel. The toilet was broken and I had to play with the handle to get it to shut up. The lid and seat looked like the discount variety. Overall the bathroom was small and the quality of the materials cheap. The walls are thin and it's not what I expected from such a hotel. Bed was nice, though as was the service. I won't stay here again.

<Content>Hotel holds true to the Hyatt name. Beautiful lobby. Great restaurants, bars. Very good location in terms of proximity to sites (Midway ship, Gaslamp district, Coronado). Nice views of harbor. Would stay here again.

<Title>“Noisy room not up to the usual Grand Hyatt standards”
<Content>The location was very convenient, the views wonderful, and the staff attempted to provide excellent service. However, our room was more like those of cheaper Hyatts, not as nice as at other Grand Hyatts we've stayed at. There was one big problem - a very noisy room. We requested a quiet room, but were given a room just below a "hospitality suite" where there were parties or receptions both nights we were there, and whenever anyone moved a bar stool or anything else on its hard floor, it echoed surprisingly loudly in our room, keeping us awake. When the cleaning staff showed up to clean the hospitality suite at about 5:30 in the morning, the noise of moving furniture or carts woke us up again. It never seemed quite worth the effort late at night to get dressed, pack, request another room, and move our things, but we seriously debated it while lying there awake listening to the crashes and bangs from above, waiting for the parties to end. If you're not a heavy sleeper, we strongly recommend you ask for a room that isn't below a "hospitality suite"! Also, the parking garage (for something like $24 a day) had really tiny spaces with many cars over the lines, so parking was difficult and annoying, sometimes with a long slow line of cars waiting to exit.

<Title>“Just ok”
<Content>I was not impressed with this hotel. Living in San Diego, there was a lot of hype when this was built. The lobby is gorgeous, but the rooms are very average. I was not too impressed and actually expected more than the average hotel room. The shower had very little hot water and the walls between rooms are VERY thin. The location is great by Seaport Village, but I was expecting a nicer hotel than what we got.

<Title>“Great views over San Diego harbour”
<Content>I have stayed at this hotel on many occassions and never have found too much at fault at the hotel. There is one down side and that is even on the 29th floor you get woken quite early by the ever blowing horns of the Amtrak and Coaster trains, along with freight trains, passing directly below the hotel..the rooms probably are double glazed they need to be tripled or more. If you want uninterrupted views of the bay ask for a reaonably high floor and if able request North Tower harbour view. There is good views form the South Tower but are limited due to the twin North Tower adjacent.

<Title>“Great Location, Amazing Views, Some Issues”
<Content>I stayed here for 5 nights in November while attending a conference, and overall, I enjoyed my experience. I was in one of the rooms in the tower that has yet to be upgraded, so I believe there were some cleanliness issues. For instance, my bare feet got dirty walking on the carpet (ewwww!) and I saw trash under the cabinet containing the fridge (double ewww). However, the bed and bathroom were clean, and the view of the bay was AMAZING from my 12th floor room. Moreover, the staff were all very friendly, the common areas of the hotel were tasteful and relaxing, and the parking--while waaaayyyyy overpriced--was very convenient. The room service had its high and low points--some dishes were excellent (such as omelets and the cheeseburger), while others were not very good (and the quesadillas were horrible.) I also believe the internet should be free in this day & age, esp. when paying close to $200/night for a room. Despite the issues this giant hotel has, I would definitely stay here again, esp. in an upgraded room, because the locale and views are wonderful.

<Title>“Enjoyed our stay at the Manchester Grand Hyatt!”
<Content>We drove down to San Diego for the Chargers vs. Chiefs game and really enjoyed our one-night stay. The lobby and entrance are beautiful, and the gym was very nice w/ state-of-the-art machines, a nice view of the bay, and scented refrigerated towels to cool of with. Our room was on the 30th floor w/ a great view of the Coronado bridge and Mexico in the distance. Spectacular sunrise! The room was clean an nice, and the bathroom was very motel-simple (but it was clean and functional which is all I care about). I would definitely stay in this hotel again!

<Title>“avoid at all costs”
<Content>Miserable hotel. Everything is grossly overpriced. Service is terrible (one hour+ for room service). A lot of the rooms are very noisey as near a/c venting for ballroom but only single glazed. The staff haven't got a clue what they're doing. I only stayed there for a 10k points offer on the rewards card which they later claimed was invalid as I booked through a third party. Total con. I will never stay at any Hyatt again and recommend you do the same.

<Title>“Not up to Grand Hyatt quality.......”
<Content>I have to agree with the previous reviewer who was at this hotel the same time as my wife and I last week. Although our experience with room cleanliness was not nearly as bad as his, it's obvious this hotel is in need of a facelift. I've stayed in many Hyatt hotels and this one is not up to par as far as the rooms are concerned. The service however at the front desk, concierge, restaurant and valet was excellent and typical of Hyatt's in my past experience. Our room on the 31st flook of the South tower had a wonderful view of San Diego Bay and everything worked as it should. The flat screen TV appeared to be the newest item in the room. The bed was just okay as far as comfort goes, but certainly not up to Westin's beds. On our next trip I think we will opt for the Westin or the Omni and avoid this Hyatt in the future.

<Title>“Very bad rooms, extremely bad for Hyatt.”
<Content>I travel to San Diego for business quite a bit and usually stay at the Omni or the Westin downtown. My brother and I travelled to the Hyatt last weekend for the Broncos/Chargers game on Monday Night Football. We arrived on Saturday and left on Tuesday. The Manchester Hyatt has a very impressive lobby, and service at the front desk and valet was very good. Unfortunately that is about all I can say for it. As a Hyatt platinum memeber I was very dissapointed in this hotel. The rooms were frankly quite nasty. Everything was old and in serious need of updating. But beyond that there were serious cleanliness issues. Wallpaper was peeling from the wall in several places, trash cans and tissue boxes were dirty beige plastic (like a motel), the vents were unclean, and several items like door hinges were covered in what looked like furry rust. I have included some pictures from my iPhone. This is not what I expect when I pay Hyatt rates. If you are going to San Diego go for the Marriott next door, the Westin, or the Omni. All are much nicer for the same or less money. I told the person at check out and she said that they were still in the process of renovating and was sorry, no other offer or price reduction. Also, know that in addition to the rate you are looking at $34 a night to park if you bring a car. I am sending these photos and a letter to the GM of this location next week.

<Content>This is an excellent conference-hotel, with a wonderful professional staff. The room appeared newly remodeled with a large flat-screen TV and new furnishings. Be aware of railroad tracks nearby, with a whistle blowing freight train during evening hours. I was warned about this, so i had ear plugs and slept ok. I had a minor problem with the room safe, where my code would no longer work. They sent a technician to replace the safe's battery, and it was ok again.

<Title>“we didn't need a car, everything was in walkable distance”
<Content>location was perfect near the water and there was a little walking trail that was pleasant to do alongside the harbor there was a lot to see in walkable distance was a little shopping village that had restaurants and boutiques. if you walked further inland there was an indoor shopping mall with the usual stores, Nordies, Macys, and some very nice eateries. we also walked to church for sunday services. The location is near the train station, so it's convenient for travelers. The weather was remarkable for early spring. Nice and warm. No rain. The staff here were helpful. Especially when we needed more in-room coffee, and when we wanted to find a nearby church with easter service. The staff provided all this.

<Title>“Nice Business Hotel”
<Content>I stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt from November 7th to the 13th. A conference I attended was hosted there. The general hotel is very large and sprawled out with two very tours. There is a bar on the 40th(?) floor with magnificent views of the harbor and city. The room I stayed in was nice clean. It had a king size bed, soft and comfortable, however the comforters made it a bit hot for my liking. The air-conditioning system kept the room cool, but I think it was a bit of an aged system as the fan would blow hard for a few minutes, shut down for a few minutes, then repeat. I had some allergy problems on this trip and I suspect the AC filters were to blame; it wasn’t that bad so I didn’t address the problem. The bathrooms was pretty standard, it was clean and worked well. However, one problem, the shower head can move up and down a pipe, so you could adjust the height to your desires. The problem was the shower wouldn’t stay locked into position, and kept slipping down, very annoying. I ate at their breakfast buffet one morning, very good selection, and excellent food, but also very expensive IMHO, $28.00. I also had diner one evening at the lobby bar and once in another bar on the other tower. The food selection was a bit shallow, but it was tasty and well prepared food. Expect beer to cost $5.50 to $8.00 a bottle. As I attended a conference at this hotel, I will also comment on those facilities. There were a number of small, medium, and large conference rooms available. The hotel also has two general session rooms that comfortably held all 600 of us. One of the general session sized rooms was for breakfast and lunch, and one was for general session presentations. Both rooms could have easily held more people. I think the hotel did a fine job hosting the conference, the meals were good, and the area was well maintained. Two small problems: the rooms were rather cool (most people would have said cold), and the area was sprawled out among different floors, and there was some long walks between rooms On a more fun note, I visited the USS Midway museum and the San Diego Zoo. The USS Midway is an aircraft carrier docked in the bay, and is a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Give yourself at least four hours to go through the ship. They have US Veterans there telling stories and talking about life on ship. In addition to the ship, they have lots of air craft of various vintages. The San Diego Zoo is a $15 taxi ride from the hotel. I was there for 5 hours, and could have stayed longer, but was tired (I had traveled that day). The zoo is immense, expect a lot of walking, and it isn’t all level. They have lots of great exhibits, well worth the cost of entrance. Also, the "Top Gun Bar" is across the road from this hotel, it's worth going to.

<Title>“Overpriced but good location”
<Content>Let me start off by saying I booked this hotel through Priceline and got what I felt was, an amazing deal. I paid about $90 compared to the $199 they were charging on other sites for this hotel. I was ready to be impressed. The hotel is very grandiose and reminds you of an old movie. The best part about this hotel was its central location. It is a 10 minute walk to Gaslamp and you can see the ocean from the top of the hotel. Other amenities include a pool and bonfire pits. The gym has a $5 charge per day I think? Also, parking is an arm and a leg. I paid $25 a day. Internet is $12.95 for minimal capabilities. If you want "business" level internet I think that is $16. It seems like a great hotel, however, it may be that because I booked through Priceline but the charm soon faded after I checked in. I came 1.5hrs early which is a little early but not early enough to skimp on quality. I was on the 8th level which I cannot complain about but if you can work your charm with the front desk, I suggest something a lot higher. When I got to my room, I noticed that the maid had just finished cleaning my room. I felt like she just rushed through to get her job done but did not thoroughly clean the room. When I went to the restroom, the toilet seat was still wet. There was remnants of something still in the sink. There was also lotion or some kind of liquid (who knows what!!?) sprayed across the wall onto the frame in the restroom. Although these things are minor, it made me paranoid the entire day about the other things she probably skipped on. I did not feel comfortable knowing that she rushed through cleaning. I felt that the room is aged, it will probably need to be upgraded in the near future. Overall, I felt like I was ripped off even though I paid half of the price. Booking through Priceline should not be different from everyone else but I'm sure the hotel has different views. I am a paying customer and I should be able to stay in a room that I KNOW has been thoroughly cleaned.

<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt with our two year old and four year old. The staff was accomodating with our request to have a microwave in the room. The lobby is gorgeous. Too bad the room we were in did not match the glamour of the lobby. Rooms need renovating. Location was great-- could see the water and Petco Park stadium outside of our window. The best part of the hotel was the gym. Top notch equipment with towel and water service. Proximity to the ocean and Seaport Village is also a major plus. Would stay again. Just watch out for the parking fees-- we weren't expecting an additional $20 a night for parking.

<Title>“They know what good service is.”
<Content>Checked in late and ordered some room service. The woman who took the rder was knowledgable, friendly, and gave us a specific time frame as to when the food would arrive. The server who brought the food in(at the time they had said) was also so helpful. The whole staff a t the horel had a very good knack for being very freindly but not overbearing in their efforts to assist you. The view from the rrom we had was amazing, a great view of the harbor with an added bonus of cataching the departure of one of the massive aircraft carriers docked on the opposite side of the harbor. The cleaners were very efficient. They cleaned the room and really seem to take some care with items you left behind, placing them neatly once they had cleaned in that area. We got great advice on an amazing Italian restaurant "Asti" from the concierge who really knew the area and everything going on. I am surprised sometimes by the lack of knowledge in some people placed in the concierge position, but this was definetily not the case. The workout area was well equipped and the staff was again very helpful. The only two small gripes I had were they wifi( the price was a little steep considering the cost of the rooms), and the beds(not the most comfortable I have ever slept in). The location of the hotel is perfect, you are minutes away from great restaurants, great attractions, the trolley is across the street. The slef parking was about 25 dollars a day which is not bad in a major city. I would stay here again in a heartbeat and do not forget to have a cocktail in the lounge the have on the top floor. What a view!

<Title>“Correct Tripadvisor impression”
<Content>We recently stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt for a convention. After reading the reviews on tripadvisor, we were concerned that we may have made a mistake booking this hotel. However, we were presently surprised, and our experience was a positive one. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful, the rooms large and clean, and the views, spectacular. The location was excellent for strolling along the harbour or walking through the picturesque old town. We did take advantage of the advice received on this internet site and asked for and received a room high in the newer Seaport Tower. One feature I particularly liked was that the elevators were quick and prompt. I found the bed mattress too soft for my taste, but we asked for and received linen changes daily. The down side, as expected, is that this is an expensive convention hotel, so take plenty of cash for tips and services.

<Title>“AMAZING VIEWS....But what's with the mismatched room decor?”
<Content>I stayed here over Halloween weekend, and it was a very good experience. I would definitely come back. I had a corner King room, and the views were completely breathtaking! The room was a nice size and very clean. However, I could not wrap my head around the decor to save my life! The hotel staff said that all rooms were renovated in 2003....I think he meant 1993. There was a very strange mix of 1800's Impressionist-style art on the walls (and the subject matter was also of that time period), along with non-descript "hotel" furniture, and the classic 1990's burgundy and forest green color scheme. Add to that a forest green southwestern-looking wallpaper border and I was just plain confused. Anyway, if you can get past the strange hodge-podge of decorations in the rooms, it's actually a nice place in a FANTASTIC location. Enjoy!

<Title>“Amazing Stay!”
<Content>This hotel's location can't be beat! After we arrived we were placed on the 5th floor and immediatly had to call the front desk, the room smelled like smoke (you could see where someone had used the outside window ledge as an ashtray) and the bed spread and chair had a strange stain on them, it almost looked like someone had rubbed their dirty shoe across them. Thankfully they were able to move us and everything after that was wonderful. The view can't be beat, the staff was incredible, and overall I would love to stay here again. Pros: - Comfortable beds - Central location to Gaslamp - Great pool and view - Room was very nice Cons: - No pool side bar (they said it closed for the season after Labor Day. It's San Diego! Land of perpetual summer.) We had to call room service to get anything delivered to the pool and it took forever. It was a bummer on such a nice warm weekend and the pool was crowded enough that they opened a makeshift bar on Saturday by the adults only pool that was being used as the main pool. - Saturday the main pool was closed for a wedding all day. Everyone had to crowd into the much smaller adult pool. - Top of the Hyatt needs an update and a bigger/better staffed bar. We waited in line for 30 minutes for cocktails and missed the sunset.

<Title>“No Reliable Hot Water”
<Content>In the 21st century, it seems inconceivable that a modern hotel in a major chain would have a problem with hot water but the Manchester Grand Hyatt does. My room, 601, would have scalding hot water followed by ice cold and would mostly stay cold. This happened over several days at various times of the day. When I complained, front desk staff said there was nothing they could do. When you add that to the dirty carpet, peeling wallpaper and cracked bathroom counters, this place is a dump. Never again.

<Title>“Good convention hotel”
<Content>Husband had a convention here so I tagged along. Hotel is well located. Near trolley stop, walking distance to gaslamp district, Horton Plaza (shopping and movie theatre), grocery store. On the water, next to Seaport Village shopping, down the street from the USS Midway Museum. Hotel convention facilities were very good and all activities were well organized. Husband reported that meals were better than average for such a large convention. The hotel is massive- about 1600 rooms- in two towers. We were first placed in the Harbor tower in a King with a view (22nd floor). Old bathroom, even though it is advertised on website as having marble tiling. Very old 25" TV. Empty refrigerator in which to keep the sodas and snacks we bought at the grocery. Comfortable bed. E-Concierge had confirmed my request for a bathrobe, but there was none. The next day, after speaking with the front desk, we changed rooms to a Premium King (corner room) in the other tower.( I was told that there were no new TVs in the Harbor Tower as yet). I again asked for a bathrobe-which he noted. This room (12th floor) was huge with big windows on two walls, big flat screen TV, partially remodelled bathroom (granite counter top); a much better room in which to spend a lot of time, which I would be doing. Under the sofa cushions was a myriad of food crumbs and other what-nots. All corners of the upholstered furniture had white lines of dust. All along the carpet where it met the walls was dirt/fuzz.. It doesn't look like the rooms ever get more than a cursory cleaning; housekeeping manager please take note! I used room service for breakfast a few times and was very satisified with service and product. Kin Spa is excellent, if that's your thing. The pool there is adults only, which is a good choice if the main pool area gets too crowded or noisy. Good work-out room- there's a $5/day charge; free for Gold Passport members. In room internet is $10/day for "economy". I tried the higher-priced "business" internet but found it not much faster than the cheap option. Overall, for such a huge hotel, they do a good job but can improve. There needs to be housekeeping oversight, and follow-up on their touted E-Concierge service needs to be better.... never did get that bathrobe.

<Title>“Great location, but upcharge crazy and only average staff.”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel for a trip to the coast, planning on visiting the San Diego Zoo and the Beach. We arrived rather late at night, only to discover that there was no Bell Service (understandable), but we couldn't use their cart (ridiculous) and we would have to wait 30 minutes for security to bring up our bags (at 2:00am?!?) so we ended up carrying our stuff up ourselves. The room was immaculate. Actually, housekeeping was a big bright spot for this trip. What was shocking was the additional charges for everything. Our Gold Passport had expired, so I guess we weren't used to it. $24 for parking each night, $5 to use the fitness center each day, and more than $10/day for internet. Uh, excuse me, but this is highway robbery for a hotel to charge those rates along with the high rate they charge for the hotel. When dealing with regular desk staff, they were not the friendly people we have experienced at other Hyatts. Also, as was said by another poster, the upper level establishments were very unkept. The lobby was immaculate, as was our room, but we had the impression they just didn't care about the rest.

<Content>My girlfriend and I stayed two nights because of the amazing deal we got through priceline. Per fellow tripadvisor correspondants, we stayed away from the hotel restaurants/bars and instead spent most of our time by the harbour and in the downtown area. The room was clean and well made both before and during our stay. The box-shaped TV was outdated, but we weren't there to watch TV anyway. As expected, internet was around ten dollars for 24 hours. However, the hotel did charge the wrong credit card despite the lobby person walking me through the self-check out. On top of that, an additional 70+ dollars was charged to my credit card for no reason (when you book through priceline, you do not pay the hotel). I called to inquire about both charges and the customer service representative moved the internet usage charge to the correct card and reversed the "phantom charge". It all turned out just fine and at a reasonable price. Great location, clean hotel. Just be careful about those phantom charges! -Dan

<Title>“My family and I are in San Diego every...”
<Content>My family and I are in San Diego every year, and usually stay here for all or part of the time. The hotel is quite nice, clean and spacious. The rooms are nice, even those in the older tower. The desk staff is efficient and courteous, as is housekeeping. You cannot beat the location - just walk out the back entrance and you are in Seaport Village and steps from the harbor. Last year we even stayed for Thanksgivingand and had dinner at the special buffet (delicious!). We did have to wait quite a while even though we had a reservation, and the staff seems a bit confused. Also, I have been here during large conventions, and non-convention goers can fall through the cracks.

<Title>“Centrally located.... great service”
<Content>Today is the last day of a 5 day stay at the Manchester Hyatt in San Diego. I was here for a conference and thoroughly enjoyed my time at this hotel. The staff was highly professional, accommodating, knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. I started my stay in the Harbor tower on the sixth floor and the room was okay, however the TV was old and the bathroom could have used a little repair/updating (the sink was chipped). For the rest of my stay, I moved to a higher floor on the Seaport Tower and it was much nicer - updated bathroom, large 42 inch flat screen TV, beautiful view. The food at the hotel was good ... breakfast buffet at Lael's the first morning offered a great selection and omelettes made to order. The rest of the food was supplied by the conference and was good as well. I don't know how they manage to prepare food for 1200+ people, but they did a great job. This hotel is centrally located within walking distance to the USS Midway, the Gaslamp Quarter, Seaport Village and a trolley that will take you to Old Towne. I would definitely recommend this hotel to both vacationers and business travelers.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel with a view of Coronado”
<Content>Stayed at his hotel for three nights - everything was just fantastic. The spa pool was awesome. Perfect location for walking to Seaport Village, Gaslamp, USS Midway, etc. The lobby and lobby bar were just great. Very clean. Because of the many events taking place there, the elevators were really tied up during peak times. Nothing to take away from this beautiful hotel though.

<Title>“Huge hotel, decent value, slow service”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel on a weekend for two days. The checkin here is EXTREMELY slow. Its a big hotel and to only have 2-3 people working checkin is absolutely unacceptable. As you can imagine checkout is slow too. Why don't they just give you a folio under your door like most hotels and call it good? I needed one because I was here on business and wasted a good 15-20 minutes waiting. Nearly an hour of my life I can't get back. The rooms are extremely average and smell musty. They could also use a makeover, especially the standard def tvs, although you are in San Diego with plenty to do. Ask for a room as far away from the elevators as possible. They are really loud compared to most hotels and run all night because of the enormity of the property. The internet is pay for play and does not live up to its cost. The wifi is spotty and you can forget about the direct ethernet service. This hotel also gets low marks from me because I requested a king size room and ended up with a double.

<Content>Great location fir any downtown SD activity. Many attractons are within walking distance and the hotel provides many activities for the kids like swimming, ping pong, playground, basketball and tennis courts, and of course the beach. Garage parking is required and expensive. Overall a great 4 star experience with a great deal on priceline!

<Content>The Manchester Grand Hyatt is a great choice for a stay in San Diego. Staff were extremely friendly, the hotel is beautifully furnished and decorated and the beds are absolutely fantastic. We stayed in a premium view room and the view was lovely looking out onto the bay. The hotel is in a great position right across the road from the trolley stop and also a short walk into the heart of the city. The pool area is fantastic and the spa is great!!!!!

<Title>“Look over your total charges at the end!”
<Content>I stayed at this location from Sept 14-21, 2010. Overall, it was an excellent stay. During the week - it feels like you have many of the amenities to yourself. Location is great for shopping, clubs and view of the water. It was an easy walk to downtown. Less than 10 minutes. Seaport village is right there and the Gas Lamp district is also just another easy walk. If you decide you would like to go to the Zoo or the Balboa park area - it is really easy to catch the bus. Total travel time less than 30 minutes. I also utilized the trolley which is right across the street and made a transfer to the blue line to go to Chula Vista. Also very easy and quick. The hotel has a great pool area with a fire pit at night. Unfortunately, without warning they turn it off. They do no consider that people are enjoying it and just shut if off around 10pm which I think is a little early. There are two hot tubs on the 4th floor pool area. I only saw food/beverage service on the weekend. It could have been there through the week, but I never saw anyone taking orders. The 40th floor offers a great atmosphere. Dimly lit area at night (which I enjoy) with a lounge setting. Be prepared to pay $ for your drinks!! Very limited food selection. The morning breakfast is great. Our reservations included 2 free meals every morning. It is a buffet stye with many selections and custom order eggs. We tipped very well during breakfast, because service was very good, but I always left cash for the tip ($20) for a $59 bill. However, upon check out - I found where they wrote in an additional tip which amounted to a total of $85 in various amounts for the week. I was really upset. It wasn't just a one time occurrence. It was every day that this was added, so I'm not sure why that practice was believed to be ok. Upon check out - the charge was removed without difficulty and the lady was apologetic, but just made me a little skeptical. I think it is interesting that hyatt still refuses to guarantee a room type (i.e. one or two beds). I was traveling with a friend and requested two beds. Reservations were made two months in advance. We were given one bed which worked out, but there was a gentleman checking in with us that couldn't get a king and had to settle for two queen beds. I also think Hyatt needs to get on board with the free internet especially for the rate they are charging. I did not get a deal on this hotel. I did utilize a AAA discount, but this was still a significant expense that didn't include many amenities. I also stayed on the club level. Unless you know you really want a snack and free coke - then don't pay the extra. They offer free breakfast in the club level, but our purchase already included that option. You must also pay for your drinks here too, but you make them yourself. The room itself was nice and well maintained. I think it is interesting that T.V.s have been a discussion in previous reviews and are still the same despite management saying there would be a change, but this was not a big deal for me. I wasn't in San Diego to watch T.V. Overall, this was a very nice place. It offered everything was needed, but at a premium price. Just look at your bill at the end.

<Title>“Needs some work but the spa is wonderful!”
<Content>I stayed at the Manchester Hyatt for a week in August while attending a convention. This would not have been my hotel of choice purely on the basis of its size…I prefer something more intimate. The hotel resembles a Las Vegas property without a casino. The décor was…creepy. Guest rooms and artwork in public areas featured pastel colors and dewy-fresh white people of a non-discernable time period and geography cavorting about with livestock. At eye-level, guests at the Manchester are treated to a visual diary of Papa Doug Manchester and his brood at various Republican events and their love for outdoor sports. Has this guy ever been diagnosed with narcissism? The rooms are in a bad need of renovation. The hotel was built in 1992 and I would guess that none of the furnishings have been updated since then. The location was great and my room had a nice view of Coronado Island and the bridge. The view from the Top of the Hyatt bar is outstanding, but don’t buy their line about it being one of the best upscale bars in San Diego. I think they have quite broad definitions of “upscale” and “Grand” at the Manchester Grand Hyatt. Despite the outdated furnishings, the room was a decent size and clean. The fact that the minibar was removed of all contents prior to my arrival was a bit offensive. I mean seriously…you all put a $500 hold on my credit card...nice way to make a customer feel like trash. But nevermind…the empty refrigerator made for a nice place to store water and wine during my visit. There was a Ralph’s supermarket 3 blocks away where I could stock up on some food and beverage and keep in the refrigerator. The housekeeping staff was attentive and pleasant. I wish the same could be said for the front desk staff…rude. I dislike being huffed at and informed, “you’re a bit early” for attempting to check in at 1 pm. It may be 1 pm for you, but for people arriving from the East Coast (as I was), it’s 4 pm and we’ve endured a long flight…cut us some slack. I don’t think I’ve EVER been put on notice in this fashion by other hotels of the same class (Westin, W, Omni, Intercontinental). Is this a Hyatt thing? A gracious host doesn’t notify you when they’re doing something nice for you…Just some advice Manchester. The fitness center wasn’t complimentary…there was a fee! (To make a comparison to a competitor, I’ve never been charged to use the fitness facility at Westin…in fact they have on occasion given me a room with a Precor machine). Internet had a fee…surprise. And the connection speed wasn’t so great…almost like a fast dial-up. But what truly counterbalanced the negative was the Kin pool area. I love the adult-only environment and the weekend party scene. It was a great way to end a tough week of work. Kin Spa was AMAZING! I had one of the best massages that I can recall. The prices for services were actually quite reasonable. But be aware that they automatically add 20% gratuity as a “convenience.” I personally have no issue with this, but others may, so be warned. The Manchester Grand has great potential to become a truly grand hotel. Lose the attitude. Focus on customer service. Renovate. But most importantly, burn some sage and purify that property of Manchester’s ego once he has completely divested himself of ownership.

<Title>“What a lovely place to visit”
<Content>This is a very nice facility to visit. We stayed at this location twice during the last month and enjoyed both visits a great deal. It is a very attractive place and centrally located in the heart of San Diego. They are currently renovating several of the rooms and doing an excellent job. Beautiful flat screen TV, top of the line bedding, incredible views of the harbor, Sea Port Village, downtown San Diego, etc. The cleanliness and service is top quality!!! We thank you Manchester Grand Hyatt for a very pleasant experience on both occasions. You have done an excellent job in your renovations and again, the service was exceptional. We highly recommend the Grand Hyatt to our friends and family.

<Title>“Grand and Great!”
<Content>Having just lost my job, it was our anniversary and I wanted to do something special without breaking the bank. I got a deal on one of the website agencies, and looking up the reviews started to be a little concerned. Called the hotel (800 number) and was assisted by a wonderful young man Jonathan who said he'd call the hotel for us and take care of us. Well, take care he did! Called the front desk and Jennifer told me I could check in early (my wife was working and I wanted to surprise her) as they had some rooms already available. Upon arrival, Vincent upgraded our room, I popped in before I left and was stunned! It was an incredible room! Later, when I returned with my wife, brie and baguette with preserved mango and some maple syrup were waiting in our room, compliments of Vincent. The entire staff were friendly and helpful. It was a dream trip and we were treated like we were special people in every detail!!!! The staff went out of their way to make this stay magic and filled with great memories! The only complaint we have was completely out of their control. At 3 am a train horn woke my wife, but I didn't hear a thing (she often is a light sleeper). Things can always go wrong in any facility, and sometimes I wonder about bad reviews. We could not have been more pleased with the staff and room at full price (which we certainly did not pay). I am confident that you would be entirely satisfied with your stay at the Manchester Grand Hyatt. Our stay was indeed grand and great and will be fondly remembered!

<Title>“Lovin' It! Grand, Indeed.”
<Content>We stayed over a weekend at the Manchester Grand Hyatt and were thrilled with everything! Although I had been to San Diego many times, I had never stayed at this hotel, preferring a smaller, boutique hotel instead. Wow. What a great place! The check-in was really simple, and they could not have been more accomodating. We were originally booked for a queen double, but they took the time to find us a king room with a view. And, can I just comment on what a view it is? The view overlooking Coronado is spectacular and unobstructed. It was beautiful at all times of the day. The room itself was really nice - not sparkling new and trendy, but comfortable and inviting. The bed was super comfortable and cozy. The best part of the room was the shower, which was magnificent. There are two shower heads, and the presssure is great, so it hits almost your entire body. It feels great and is one of the best showers I've seen in a hotel. We had drinks at the top of the hotel, which is an experience in and of itself. Beyond the view, it's an elegant way to either start or wrap up the evening. The staff is really nice and we really enjoyed. As for the location, you really can't beat it. It's right at Seaport Village, so easy access to all the shops and restaurants. It's also only a few blocks from the Gaslamp District for nightlife and restaurants. Overall, I would definitely stay again. In fact, I'm looking forward to it!

<Title>“Is This "Grand Hyatt" Grand”
<Content>I stayed here last weekend on a Friday and Saturday night with my brother who came from SF with a group for the Padres Giants series. They stayed at the next door Marriott. I read the reviews and did not know what to expect as there were so many. We checked early 1:30 pm no problem. From the get go there did not seem to be any problem but me at first. I forgot to request a smoking room and we had to switch. The front desk switched us to a smoking room and said someone would meet us at the new room in the opposite tower a good walk. However after a 15 minute wait at the door of the new room I went down to the front desk and got the keys myself. As I got back to the new room the newbi asst. mgr. was leaving. When I went inside my brother told me that the newbi had let him into our new room but then when my brother asked him for a the keys he had a blank look and said sorry and left. Not inspiring,and as I think what was he smoking. I then went to the main pool on the 4th floor a great location. I was asked 10 times in 3 hours if I wanted a drink by the pool waitress. I saw adults and kids and conventioneers or seminar people having a good time in the water, restaurant/bar area that has a great view of the San Diego Bay. My only complaint was that the Hot Tub was 104f a bit too hot. However the company was great. Went to the game slept great and I did not notice bed linens as a problem. We came back the next afternoon after a day ball game and hit the 3rd floor pool that was for adults. Very relaxing with a pool bar. Hot tub was perfect at 101f for me. we had some drinks in the sports bar in the north tower and went to Seaport Village for dinner a short walk away. Then back to room. At about 12:00am the room next to us started a party that went on until the wee hours and I could hear it. Before I went to sleep after reading a bit, I dipped into my travel bag and brought out my old fashioned anti-noise weapon to combat this aural onslaught: Ear Plugs-"Don't ever stay in a hotel without them." You can buy the foam ones that mold to your ear canal at all the drug stores and most are rated for commercial use like snoring, now cheaply. The next morning it was a easy in room check out and then bailing my car out of parking. Overall my only complaints are the price for valet parking of $34 a day and the distance from the bar to the nearest mens room. From what I saw and from other complaints like the newbi without the keys, I know that this area and this hotel always has a high front of the house staff turnover with lots of new employees so there are bound to be problems as locating clean rooms as the previous poster noted. I hope they contact Hyatt Corporate directly for a full refund. Other than that it was not that bad; The cleaning staff and room maids were the best representatives for the hotel that I saw. If i needed anything on the cart for my room all I had to do was ask. Yes it needs some minor upgrading. Yes Management, Corporate and Hyatt Franchising/ Training needs to help train the front of the house staff better. But for the rest of complaints I have read on this board it seems there are more complaniers. Come on people when you stay away from home it is different. There could be noise in a hotel, late. When you call ahead for a request ask for confirmation in a email/text/letter with your confirmation number and the name of the person you talked to. I have alway found that if there is there is a problem with the room contact the manager first, and if the problem continues let him know you will go up the line if the problem is not resolved. Always remember you as the customer, have the power when you are there. As after you leave you you can only complain here. In full disclosure I got this Hotel on PriceLine for $65 a night.

<Title>“Very disappointed with our second stay at this hotel”
<Content>I had called the hotel after making the reservation with priceline to confirm that we would be able to get a king bed. When we checked in, they said they had no king beds available. They gave us our keys and we went up to our room. We quickly noticed that some things were off. There was a newspaper on the back of the toilet, one of glasses had water in it, there was a wet towel on the back of the door and there was trash in the trashcans. We called down to the front desk to let them know our room wasn't clean. They said they would give us a new room which was a king. We went down and got the new keys and went up to our new room. This room was in worse shape than the previous. They pillows were all over the floor with no pillowcases, there was pee on the toilet seat, and everything was strewn about the room. I called the front desk for a second time. They said they were out of rooms so they'd have to send someone up to clean the room. We didn't end up getting in our room until 10:30 that night. The next morning, the phone rang. It was the front desk. They let us know that there was a flood near our room and we needed to switch rooms for a third time. They brought us up new keys. When we tried them in our new room they didn't work. We didn't get the room figured out and the correct keys until noon. We lost plenty of vacation time messing around with dirty rooms and broken keys. We were very unhappy with the entire experience. We had stayed at this hotel before and we happy to stay at it again but now we never wish to stay there again. When I called the Hyatt to explain about our terrible service in their "4 star" hotel, they offered a $30 gift card. That is certainly not enough to make me ever want to go back.

When are you REALLY going to get your act together and get the renovations done? I booked a trip banking on the renovations you said you would have done by now, and they weren't. Totally unsatisfactory.

<Title>“Kin Spa summer warning: Party scene!”
<Content>Guests of the Kin Spa at the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San Diego need to know that between Memorial Day and Labor Day, the hotel converts the spa pool to an adult bar/lounge with very loud music and smokers. Access to the pool is locked from inside the spa during this summer period. On the weekends, the pool becomes a popular mega-party scene that invades the serenity of the spa environment. We were informed that the pool area converts back to a spa-only pool after Labor Day. If you are looking for a serene environment for a relaxing massage, you may not find what you seek on a summer weekend at the Kin Spa.

<Title>“Motel 6 rooms”
<Content>I arrived on Saturday around 9pm. They didn't have the room I requested so I got "upgraded" to a bay front room. Which meant a view of the pool and the building across from me, not the bay. To tell you the truth, I didn't particularly care one way or the other because I was leaving by 11:30am. So I get settled in and begin to change for a night out on the town. I immedietly notice that the bathroom trash can had bandaids,wadded up tissues and other things in it. I laughed to myself and turned on the shower. I went and grabbed my one towel, yes my one towel and jumped in. Someone didn't clean the shower either, you can imagine what was in there, so moving on :)... I had a great time out and stopped by cafe sevilla for tapas and a drink or two or three. I just got back from ny and it brought me back to a great tapas place from the city. When I finally got to the hotel I was looking forward to a great night of sleep. I was awakened by maid service from 8:30am till 9:40am, and I kept telling her I was sleeping till check out. I don't know if there was a language barrier or what but this happened twice. I gave up on sleep and called down to the lobby to ask if i could check out over the phone. The lady asked how my stay was, I didn't go over everything but told her a few of the things. She took a water off my hotel bill. This hotel should run around $120 and only for the fact of where it's located. Even with the cleanliness issue the furniture, carpeting,linens and floor plan doesn't constitute $250.

<Title>“I would not stay here again!!!”
<Content>I have stayed in several hotels in the San Diego area and I happened to get this hotel via Priceline. The first thought was very cautious as I read the reviews on Tripadvisor. The Hotel was nice, but after checking in, the guy at the front desk didn't even thank me for being there. Maybe he looked at "how" I booked the hotel via Priceline and I was not profitable. I get that the self-parking is $24 which is fine, all San Diego Hotels charge these kind of fees. Well when we went to our room, we first notice that the walls are very thin. I mean very very thin. We could hear every word the people next to us was saying. So went to sleep. 2:30am comes around with slamming of doors and extremely loud music, just like a party. I call front desk and they transfer me to security. I told them, I have a infant sleeping and my family is trying to get a good night sleep, that they had to do something or move us to another room. The neighboring people apparently got back from some crazy party and continued their rant in the room. Security didn't do much to help as they kept the party going without the music. Needless to say, no goodnight sleep here. Never again would like recommend or stay at the Manchester.

<Title>“Comfortable but so odd in so many ways”
<Content>Comfortable but strange hotel. Essentially a Vegas-style mega-resort without the casino. (Was this really needed in San Diego?) The interior design is over-the-top, with a huge reception area and public spaces. Although the service is friendly, there is nothing intimate about anything. This has to be the most partisan hotel I’ve ever experienced, with dozens of photographs of the hotel’s owners with prominent Republicans – Don Rumsfeld, Katherine Harris (of Bush v. Gore fame), Schwarzenegger – plastered all over the walls of the lobby. (Might be an idea to find photos of a few more people of color.) The rooms are comfortable, although the furniture is out-of-date, some of the linens are worn and the artwork is kitsch. The wired internet in my room didn't work despite 30 minutes on the phone with a technician, and the wireless was crazily slow.

<Title>“This is the third year in a row that I...”
<Content>This is the third year in a row that I have stayed at this property and the first in a conference suite. I have to say that I will not stay here again until the remodel/refurbishing is complete. The suite was so very tired and outdated. This is not the typical Hyatt quality that other locations have. Maybe that's why Mr Manchester sold his controlling ownership to Hyatt and why the updating has been in need for quite some time. Upon arrival the valet was very rude but all other staff members were so very gracious, especially Michael at checkout. Was a fun week with so much within walking distance. I really can't wait till the updating so I can return.

<Title>“Very Nice Hotel”
<Content>We booked this hotel on Priceline for $100 - what a deal. We were upgraded to a bay view room. The windows stretched from floor to ceiling which made the view amazing. The room also had high ceilings which made it feel more spacious. The only major drawback is that parking costs $24 a day. While this seems an outrageous price, if you consider the erea, you could easily spend that much just parking to shop/dine in downtown. Bottom line, I recommend this hotel - especially if you can get a room with a view.

<Title>“Nice Lobby Average Hotel”
<Content>It's big. It has a nice lobby. Short walking distance to the convention center and gaslamp night life. I was here on business and it did it's job. Heck I didn't pay for it. It was close to waterfront but if you are looking to stay in the gas lamp look futher. I don't hate the hotel, I would stay here again but it's average inside. Rooms not roomy but it did have a great view of the USS Midway and the San Diego Bay. One thing that bugged me was they charged to use their fitness center. I rather hit up the 24 hour fitness a few blocks away. Again I would come back but I rather go to the Aranez (formally the Ivy) for more action and life of the Gas Lamp.

<Title>“Steer Clear”
<Content>I've stayed in this hotel many times - never again. The place has become dated to the point of dilapidation in some areas. The room furniture is worn, scratched, chairs were threadbare and the bathrooms are old, stale and dingy. The 1980's style TV belongs in a museum, not to mention the poor reception that accompanies the relic. We had access to the Club Floor which was a total joke. The offerings in the club room were meager. For one who drinks a lot of water however, this might be a good deal in that the Club Room offers bottled water complimentary, which is a far cry from the $4.50 charge for water in the rooms. Another major rip off is the $35 valet parking - the highest in San Diego that I've encountered. Service, or lack of, is another issue. The staff is indifferent to rude. Our room was not made up one day. I called "At Your Service " twice and still no results. At 6:00 that night I"d had enough and went to the front desk to complain. A shoulder shrug and telephone call later, the problem was corrected. It was almost 8pm by that point. The toilet barely flushed, and there was a continuous back-up of black/gray material sludge material in the bathroom sink that reeked of raw sewage. The AC system barely cooled the room, and the carpet was dirty and well worn. We couldnt wait to leave, never to return. This is the worst Hyatt I've ever stayed in, and as a Hyatt Platinum member, I feel more than qualified to complain.

<Title>“Very Good Hotel; Short of being able to call itself a Resort”
<Content>The Manchester is a solid hotel with very good service, fantastic location on the waterfront/seaport village and very comfortable rooms. With the look of its lobby and general atmosphere you can see that this hotel wants to be a resort destination but falls a little short; some of this is in control of the hyatt/some of this is not. My reservation for the Manchester was for a family package (50% off the second room, adjoining and breakfast plan). Basic point is be sure to verify your email reservation details exactly in the email confirmation. A few weeks before arriving I called to change my arrival date and verify the reservation to find out the adjoining request had not been confirmed, which the reservation agent told me it had.. obviously a challenging situation with small kids but luckily something I corrected well before arriving and specifically asked for an email showing this request. When I actually arrived at the hotel; found out the wrong "family plan" had been reserved resulting in the breakfast plan not being added to my reservation .. again took several conversations with the staff and management (and a call to central res.) but ultimately things got fixed .. not sure if these issues were via central reservation or the Manchester directly but there seems to be an issue with their promotion packages so be sure to double check everything. Regarding the train horn comments .. you are going to hear the train regardless of your room location .. accept that if you're staying here. The metro, freight and commuter trains all pass the hotel on a track that is about 100 yds off the hotel and perpendicular to both towers, therefore all the rooms experience it. It's not that big a deal but if you're expecting no train horns; then you'll be disappointed. It is a downtown hotel and the street noises of a downtown location apply. For the size and cosmetics of the hotel, yes the pool is a bit small and it does seem like the suntan lotion film builds up at times; but again other factors are net positive; the elevated pool deck with a view of the San Diego waterfront and skyline as well as the various activities they try to plan for the kids gives almost a cruise like feel to the pool/hotel. Breakfast buffet was fantastic and not just because we had it comp'd as part of the rate plan .. really a good buffet (waffles are very tasty). We were out for other meals so can't comment on the restaurants for the other meals. Add in the amenities of Seaport village at the back door of the hotel, gas lamp which is about a 15-20 minute walk and San Diego in general where it's hard not to enjoy yourself and this hotel be comes a very solid choice for pleasure or of course business.

<Title>“Even though the hotel lobby looks "grand" it's a very average hotel...”
<Content>My husband and I and baby stayed here 3 nights. We were given a room with 2 double beds and a great view of the bay. The bed was small, but my husband and I aren't huge people and were comfortable sharing the double. We found the bed to be comfortable and slept really well, but maybe our beds were newer than those in other reviews. Positives: We had a great view from our room. The location of the hotel was great for us. The room was clean. We didn't have any issues checking in or out...staff seemed courteous enough. Negatives: In-room bottled water costs 4.50 for a smallish aquafina bottle...bring your own if you're staying here. Self-parking at the hotel is around $23 a day! Maybe there is someplace free to park not too far off, but we didn't have time to figure out where that might be. Room was very average (disappointing average)...actually cheaper quality than a $70 a night hotel we had just stayed at. Overall it was a very average experience and room for the price we payed (which was even discounted!) and we are used to staying in some nice places. The lobby may look grand, but the rooms don't live up to the lobby's hype. I'd recommend staying elsewhere...I'm sure you can get more for your money in San Diego.

<Title>“Did not meet normal Grand Hyatt Expectations”
<Content>The pools were pretty nice. The staff were mostly nice, especially the check in staff and the pool bar staff. The room was quite a let down. I was moved to a room with 2 doubles rather than one King despite my month ahead booking of the King Room. The bathroom was small and needed additional cleaning before I would use it. The wallpaper, carpet, and decor was quite outdated. The conference rooms were pretty decent. I've seen better, i've seen worse. The view from my room was quite nice (the Coronado Bridge)... The location of the hotel was also very nice as it was walking distance to very good restaurants. for the price I could've stayed at the Hard Rock which is more centrally located and much more up to date. It wasn't the worse. It was still decent hotel and I got over the outdated look, but when I pay this much i expect a bathrobe in the closet., a little nicer of a bathroom, and the bed i requested since I booked well in advance. Also, the hotel was booked for several conferences at once, and one morning around 7AM the room next to mine must have turned into a meeting room because it was loud with talking and conversation. Not idea in my opinion I prefer hyatt most of the time, but this time I was quite underwhelmed.. Hopefully they update the hotel in the next year or two.

<Title>“So so, would not do again”
<Content>The lobby of the hotel was beautiful but when we got to the room it was a HUGE disapointment. The bed was the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in. Room service was slow and our food was cold every time. House keeping was great and the place was clean, except for the rust in the bath tub. Location is unbeatable but we could have stayed somewhere else for half the price. One more thing, parking was $25 a night in their parking garage, they said it is not theirs but it is attached and says Hyatt all over it.

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel”
<Content>Booked on expedia (4th night free) planned to stay 4 nights. Changed our plans to stay another night as our boys (aged 12 and 11) liked it so much. Great pool area on 4th floor between the towers so great views. Deal included buffet breakfast for two (had to pay half price for the kids = $12 each) but well worth it. We knew the parking was expensive from reviews we saw before we went but we factored it in to the total price so not such a shock. This is a great hotel. All the staff were helpful - particularly the reception desk. Great location, short walk to Embarcadero and Gaslamp District. Great views from the 40th floor. Unfortunately we won't get the chance to go back to California for a while but it would be our first choice in San Diego.

<Content>I had an amazing facial from Marla who used to be the lead esthetician from the now closed Spa Tiki. I was also pleased to learn that the only spa massage therapist worth spending money on in the downtown area, Oleg who also came from Spa Tiki is working there. If you were a regular at Spa Tiki request them and you will be treated well and be given 110% service. Well worth the money, especially since most of the older spas are now closed downtown.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel in Great Location, But...”
<Content>The hotel is grand, huge and overall absolutely gorgeous! Here's my quickie rundown: Checking in - easy and quick, no problems. My Room - despite being near the elevators, it wasn't too noisy and the view was fabulous. But, where was the flatscreen TV? Even budget hotels have hi-def flat panel TVs. For the price point and the overall grandeur of the Grand Hyatt, the hotel needs to update the TVs. Oh yes, and the fixtures in the bathroom are a bit dated too. I definitely liked the fact that there was a refrigerator in the room (I took a quickie walk to the nearby Ralphs and stocked up on water & yogurt for breakfast). Nickel & Diming - If you're not at least a goldpassport member you've gotta pay $5 for a visit to the gym. And come on Hyatt, no free wifi either??! Location - Terrific. There's plenty to do within walking distance. Just watch out for all those pedi-cabs. they're everywhere! Overall, I had a great stay. The bed was perfect for sleeping. I felt safe at all times. The room was stylish. And the lobby was indeed grand!

<Title>“A great deal...IF you use Priceline!”
<Content>Priceline landed us at yet another 4-star Gaslamp hotel ($95 seems to be the magic number). Like I said in my reviews of the Omni, Westin & Hilton Bayfront, all of these places pretty much blend together in my mind. I'm just not a corporate girl...hence, the 3-stars. The Manchester Hyatt has a great location down by Seaport Village. Parking is typically expensive. When I asked my daughter (who arrived before I did) how the room was she said "It looks like all the rest." Our room did look like all the rest...not better, not worse. If you like corporate predictability, you'll be fine here.

<Title>“Luxury hotel right in the heart of San Diego!”
<Content>I stayed 1 night at the Hyatt a few weeks ago with some friends and their families. I stayed in a premium view room with 2 of my friends, other friends were in the room right next to ours on the 14th floor and the others were in a junior suite on the 30th floor in the other tower. Our room was spacious and clean and the bed was very very comfy. The view on the harbor was amazing too! From our room we could see the harbor, Seaport Village, the USS Midway museum and some skyscrapers. The only drawbacks of the room were the old TV set, the internet connection fee ($12) and very little toiletries, but I guess we could have asked for more and we would have got them. We asked for more towels and they brought them to us right away. The service was very excellent. Our friends in the suite asked if they could fix the shower because it was leaking and instead of fixing it they were upgraded to the Manchester suite! It's on the 39th floor, which is the highest, and you can't have access to it if you haven't got a card that allows you to push the 39 button in the elevator, so we had to get our friends in the lobby (which is absolutely beautiful btw) to get us to their room. The junior suite was very nice, with a kitchenette, a living room with a big table for 8 persons, 2 couches and some armchairs, a master bedroom with a king-size bed, 2 bathrooms and a view on the whole bay, on the Coronado bidge and on the island and baseball stadium too. The Manchester suite was very fancy! First, the walls in the 39th floor hallways were made of glass so you could see the pool and the whole bay and the suite was just fabulous! A big living room with sofas and armchairs around the TV (which was old too), a big dining table, lots of ancient chinese pieces of pottery everywhere, a small kitchen, a huge master bedroom and 2 big bathrooms (one didn't have a shower though). The view form that suite was very nice too, but I have to say that the one from the standard suite was nicer. If you want a suite at the Hyatt I'd suggest to get the standard one. As of the other services, we went to the pool in the morning and it was pretty crowded but quiet anyways. They gave us towels and deckchairs and complimentary mints, chapstick (you could choose orange or coffee flavor) and key ring. We ordered food there but we didn't really like it. It wasn't very expensive but tacos were not so good and fruit too. Our friends got room service for breakfast and said gauffres were gorgeous though. I would recommend the hotel afterall since you can get to the Gaslamp quarter (where all the restaurants and nightlife are) in just 10 minutes on foot or you can rent bikes for the hotel. We opted for a cycle rickshow ride for 10 dollars and we really liked it. I will definitely stay again at the hotel when I go back to SD.

<Title>“As others noted--a great hotel, but....”
<Content>They need to eliminate the fees charged for internet wi-fi! That was the major drawback to my stay. The hotel is a very nice, well maintained hotel in an excellent location for our convention. However, charging $10.00 per day for wi-fi is outrageous and ridiculous in today's reliance on the internet. Though I plan to return to San Diego, this is a big enough reason for me not to choose the Hyatt. I don't like getting nickled and dimed for no other reason than to pad the earnings and it's totally unecessary for a convention-destination hotel as nice as the Hyatt!

<Title>“Great Hotel!”
<Content>Pros: The pool has a lot of activities, and has a play area too! The staff were very friendly.Seaport Village was literally at the back of the hotel. Rooms were VERY comfy, quiet and spacious and not to mention clean! Great view of San Diego and the marina from every floor. Smores every night down at the pools fire pits. Gaslamp District just a walking distance from the hotel, Seaworld and San Diego Zoo and other amusement parks were a good distance from the hotel. Got a good price for the room! Family friendly too! Cons: The sounds of the train horns made falling asleep hard. Wi-fi came with a fee of about $12. Parking also very expensive, but somewhat reasonable, for $1 an hour which is all in all $24 a day. Great hotel! We enjoyed staying here a lot! Hopefully, we will come back again! :D 5/5 stars!

<Title>“Looks can be deceiving”
<Content>From the outside, the Manchester Grand Hyatt looks like a 5 star resort. The location is awesome, and the lobby is beautiful, but beyond that...yikes! I traveled with my wife and 2 young boys mainly to see some of the local attractoins (the USS Midway tour is well worth the visit). Once in our room (we stayed in the Harbor Tower) I noticed immediately how old everything looked. I would expect a "Grand Hyatt" to be a little nicer than this. I've stayed in much nicer Best Western's for a third of the price. Everything is totally outdated. other than the view, there's not one good quality to the room. So as long as you keep staring out the window I guess you'll be fine. The pool is pretty tiny for such a big hotel. The water looked uninviting to say the least. The water looked like a combination of pee, sunscreen, and chlorine...I wouldn't go in. The coctail service was extremely slow too. In the room, my wife ordered an extra coffee (they give you only one regular packet for 1 cup!) and they never delivered it. She had to walk down the hallway and swipe one off a maid's cart. I am normally not very difficult to please when it comes to hotel accomidations, but for some reason it seemed everything about this place was wrong. If you're planning on forking out the money to stay here, just lower your expectations and maybe you'll find it worth while.

<Title>“Overall Great Stay with a Few Caveats”
<Content>Stayed with my family during a recent conference. Fantastic location right on the bay, adjacent to Seaport Village/waterfront park, and 5-10 minute walk to convention center and downtown. Impressive towering hotel with amazing lobby. The hotel staff in all areas were fantastic and accomodating. Rooms were fine and extremely clean along with the rest of the hotel and grounds. We stayed on the 9th floor facing the city and it was pretty loud. Windows do not drown out much noise. Between the traffic, sirens, adjacent train tracks, and various aircraft it was almost ever present. Couple that with the loud AC system and it could be an issue for some folks. Perhaps if you request an inside room facing the other hotel tower it would be less of a factor, but you give up on some of the view. Found the hotel food to be quite good and moderately priced. No free in-room wi-fi and parking is steep but common in San Diego. Fantastic and complete fitness center but there is a charge if you are not a Hyatt Passport Card member. We traveled with small children (under 10) and they loved the play area with field turf adjacent to the outdoor pool. Plenty of room to run around, play ping pong, foosball, kick soccer balls, throw the football, and even basketball courts. It added a ton to our trip and was an awesome touch! The outdoor pool is great with nice views all around. One small item was they did not have typical children's programming available on the TV line-up such as Disney or Nick which I found odd. Older TV's, no flat screens, and the picture and sound were inconsistent from channel to channel in our room. However, all in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, thanks to the staff and amenities and would easily stay here again knowing what we now know.

<Title>“Kin Spa Review”
<Content>This review is for the spa only. Had a facial booked in the morning, will not mention the name of the Aesthetician so not to get her in trouble.. I have had many facials and I have to say this was my least favorite. First off, she had on a very strong fragrance on which I think should not be acceptable, especially when your there to enjoy whatever aromatherapy treatments they offer. From the very start, I was not feeling relaxed about the whole experience. Once she had me situated on the table, she started asking me questions relating to the facial but then she kept on chatting, asking me about my stay, etc. At first I thought she would eventually stop, and even when I gave her one word answers, she still didn't get the message. I was too chicken to ask her to stop, so I guess that's my fault. In most facials I've had the person doing them is as quiet as possible, and if they have to ask me to turn, they whisper and are careful not to make too much noise opening drawers.. The whole experience was not a good one, plus their facilities for being in such a large hotel was very small.. 1 shower, no dressing room except right by your locker where people are coming and going.

<Title>“run for your life”
<Content>Shabby. In desperate need of a re-launch. Rooms look like the furniture and other decore was bought at a garage sell. Room service made us sick all night, bath tub drains and ends up gurgling up in the sink. Found a small drop of blood on the floorboard of the bathroom, and the wallpaper was actually peeling off the wall, probably because there are no vent fans in there, so everything in those bathrooms gets covered in water when you shower. Slso room description clearky states "marble floors in bathroom, " try terra cotta tile. The sink was marble and that was it for marble. Extra blanket was literally thread bare and falling apart. Bedding was wrinkled like it was left in the dryer too long. Old box set TVs, like 22". Asked for a rollaway bed at noon ( after we had to move from our first room that was a double, to a king) I needed a place for my 2 year old to sleep. Never got it. Had to call back at 8pm for the rollaway, did not recieve it until almost 9pm. Was dismayed to see a hallway FULL of extra rollaways down the hall from my room, after I literally waited 9 hours for one. Paid extra for the Grand Club. What a joke, it is a room like the breakfast bars in the holiday inn, you just need a key to access it and the floor its on. Everytime i went there, except for breakfast, there were no employees there. By the way breakfast in the club room is shabby too, Holiday Inn's breakfast bar is way more extensive and better food. Grand Club boasts concierge, and I called them twice only to be transferred to guest services, I still cant figure out what it is they do exactly. Their little paper booklet about the Hyatt had a booger and coffee stains on it. (I have pics of that by the way) Room decor was at best dissapointing in comparison to the lobby. If every room was decorated and cared for like the lobby this review might have been different. Like i said in desperate need of a re-launch. Only good thing about this hotel was the view. Thats it. Everything else was just scummy. Gross. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY, and I got a 50% discount because of all the problems. Only spoke to one employee that seemed to care. Customer service was abissmal at best. I honestly thought they should have comped the whole thing. The hubby and I cut our trip short because we could not stand being there for even one more minute. As my husband left ( we took seperate cars) he tried to get his parking stub validated, to which he was told that the garage we parked in (the big one attached to the hotel that says Hyatt on it...) wasnt their garage and parking isn't free. He then asked to speak to a manager, to which the 3 employees that were there (it was real early) refused. He asked two more times and they still did not. They acted as they couldn't hear him. When we left the garage, that "isn't run by Hyatt", it was attended by a Hyatt employee in uniform. When the hubhub and I go back to San Diego, we will stay elsewhere. Maybe the Holiday Inn, I have never been let down by them. This experience at the Hyatt Manchester Grand was easily the absolute worst, ever!

<Title>“Good quality hotel but with some service and noice issues.”
<Content>This hotel is very large and geared to tourists and conventioneers visiting downtown San Diego. The location is very good and walking distance to different activities. The views from the rooms, the pool and the top level bar are very good. The public areas and rooms are standard Hyatt quality. Extra charges abound which is typical for a 'full service' hotel. Parking is $24 per day for self parking. Internet is $10 per day for standard and $13 for 'business' quality. I paid for the premium business internet but found a speedtest at 5pm only produced 0.20 Mbps which is not even close to being high speed. The service of the hotel leaves something to be desired. I left for the whole day and returned at 4pm to find the room unclean. I called the operator who tried to connect to housekeeping but disconnected. The next call got through and the person said they would send someone to clean the room . At 6:30pm after going to the pool, still no service. Had to ask again at the front desk on the way to dinner. The beds are good for sleeping but at 2am a freight train blew its horn loudly and repeatedly which absolutely had to have woken everyone up at the hotel. No way to sleep through that. The trolleys don't make much noise with their horns and the crossing gates and they stop by midnight. Speaking of loud, continuously for about an hour around 7pm a guy on the sidewalk blared messages very loudly in a megaphone asking everyone to check out and boycott the hotel. Something about same sex marriages and the management of the hotel but it wasn't a welcome noise added to the existing din.

<Title>“Disappointing Accomodations with Awesome View - But You Pay For It!”
<Content>Stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel in San Diego with my 25 yr. old niece, for a week-long conference at the Convention Center a couple blocks away. Beautiful public spaces, clean rooms - but very average accommodations (furnishings a bit worn, surprisingly.) Our original room given to us on the 14th floor had a large fan drying an obvious wet area on carpeting. We asked for a place to wait or other room and was given an upgrade on the 24th floor - with a spectacular view of the harbor and Seaport Village below! Hotel staff extremely accommodating & very gracious to give us this new room promptly! The view was the best part of this hotel stay. We even got to enjoy scenic fireworks off the USS Midway, watched from our 24th floor room. The room upgrade was really for the view, because room furnishings were a bit disappointing: noted worn areas on chair/draperies/bedspreads, slight stains on carpeting in this room. Disappointed that internet was not free/included, but co$t additional $10/day. ('Thought free internet was fairly standard in most hotels today, especially hotels of this quality?) San Diego is an expensive town, & this hotel was no different. Restaurants in hotel quite pricey, but we only ate at Redfield's (sports bar in lobby of hotel.) Food was O.K., but nothing special - except the price. Room service menu was way out of our league as well. Seaport Village next door had several smaller restaurants/cafes with excellent food at a little more reasonable prices. We especially enjoyed The Pier Restaurant - great seafood! Hotel is in a good location for walking to Convention Center and downtown/Gaslight District. There were many things to see & do here. Also enjoyed the San Diego Trolley Tour, which picks you up right next door at Seaport Village. Be sure you get to visit Old Town San Diego as well: what a wonderful tour back through history here! A very enjoyable day! Hotel staff were very helpful, providing maps of areas we requested & additional area information. We found Kansas City BBQ - across the street from the hotel (Top Gun movie with Tom Cruise, et al.....filmed some scenes here) had terrific food & better prices. One of the 2 hotel pools was closed, & the 2nd pool had some private party going on the one time we tried to use it, therefore gave up on a swim altogether. Our stay at the Manchester Grand Hyatt had its high & low points. We were a bit disappointed, & expected a little more for the price we were paying to stay here for a week. But we did enjoy the free time we had in town & the many other things we got to do & see in San Diego.

<Title>“Lovely Hotel, GREAT customer service”
<Content>The Manchester Grand Hyatt is a beautiful hotel in a beautiful location. It boosts an impressive lobby, great meeting facilities and good food. What makes it stand out is customer service. I arrived very early in the morning following a night they actually had 100% occupancy. They quickly checked me in (to my great relief), however, upon entering the room I found that some sort of significant repair was underway. I rung the desk and was told I could be moved to another room shortly. I ran to a meeting and when I returned checked into a new room. This was all handled smoothly and I was satisfied. What knocked my socks off is that the VIP Coordinator for the hotel had send a lovely bottle of wine and a cheese plate to my room that afternoon. This is above and beyond what I expected and earned them HUGE kudos in my book.

<Title>“Best Hotel”
<Content>I have been to many hotels and this is one of the best. It is a good idea to become a gold passport member. We got upgraded to an Executive Suite in the Harbor tower. Before we got this room, we were given a room in the seport tower, which I know reviews say is newer, but they are identical. The train never bothered me and never woke me up, unless you go to bed around 8, you don't have a problem. Parking is pretty expensive, but everything makes up for it. The Lael's buffet is not amazing, but is good. The hotel staff is very helpful. They never left us waiting and there were hardly any lines, and I went on the Fourth Of July weekend. Once you leave the Harbor tower, you are immediately in Seaport Village and is a very short walk to the USS Midway. Everything is within walking distance of the hotel except Seaworld. I had a very nice dinner at Georges On Fifth, which is very expensive, but you truly get what you pay for. I walked to the Marriott, Hilton, and other hotels, but the Manchester Grand seems much nicer. The room is quiet and you cannot hear the other rooms, or outside. You can open the window about half a foot out, which lets in the fresh air. I never waited more than 10 seconds for an elevator in the huge, grand hotel.I am used to staying at Four Seasons and other Luxury hotels and this hotel is easily comparable to those hotels and may win. Overall, I love this hotel and hope to come back to this hotel many more times. This hotel is truly one of a kind and grand.

<Title>“Extremely happy with stay - expectations exceeded across the board.”
<Content>My wife and I wanted a day to get away. I did tons of hotel research and frankly this one wasn't in the running because I was looking for a more botique type hotel. But a friend strongly recommended Priceline and I figured what the heck? I put in an aggressive rate since I was looking at $179-$250 for a single night. For under $100 I got this hotel and was really surprised when I started reading about it - two pools, view type rooms, etc. I was pretty happy - until I got there - then I was blown away. This place is gorgeous with a great location. They upgraded us since it was a special occassion - Pablo (our check in guy) was absolutely fantastic. Everyone we talked to was great, positive, and happy. My wife kept commenting how we had the happiest Hotel staff in the world. Our room had just fantastic views, the hotel staff gave great Gaslamp information. We hoped for a great experience and got a stupendious one. Pablo at check was ultra nice and really got us started off in fantastic fashion and the rest of the staff followed through on that. Thanks so much for such a good trip for my wife and I. We WILL be coming back!

<Title>“Great Stay”
<Content>We visit SD several times a year and this particular visit combined business with pleasure. Normally we gravitate to Hilton, but thought we would try the Hyatt. We made a fantastic choice. The hotel staff was very personable and welcoming. We received an upgrade to floor 28 with a beautiful view of the harbor. Package included breakfast buffet which was wonderful. Sunday morning there was quite a wait for buffet (about 25 mins) but they had self serve coffee available during the wait. Recommend getting to buffet early to avoid the wait. The beds weren't the best we've ever had at a hotel, but were certainly adequate. They had a free family movie outdoors by the pool which was thoroughly enjoyable. Location is great, right by Seaport Village and other dowtown sights.. Was surprised by the big tube TV (no flat screen), but aside from being old school we didn't really mind it a bit since we weren't there to watch TV. Fridge and safe in the room are both great conveniences. The bar on the 40th floor had the most unbelievable views in SD. Ordered cocktails and a cheese platter for 3 for about $50 including tip. Within walking distance of Roys of Hawaii (recommend for a fantastic meal) Very long line for checkout, but they had a convention coming in. Check in was a breeze. All in all a very enjoyable stay and we will certainly consider the Hyatt for our next trip to SD. A classy recommendation for valet parking which we experienced at the Beverly HIlton---leave a couple of water bottles in the car when the customer picks it up. For $39 a night (plus tips) for parking, a little amenity would make it feel a little better!!

<Title>“Good location, good service, nice property”
<Content>We travel a lot and frequently at chain hotels. This "Grand" Hyatt has the same amenities as the Regency rooms but the property is more extensive. The hospitality was excellent everyone was very nice and accomodating. Housekeeping was spotty. A wad of gum was stuck on the clock/radio which the housekeeper had missed. When we came back to the room after breakfast, the room had already been made up, which was nice. The door was not latched however......which wasn't..... another oversight. The property is well kept, service is first rate, prices are high. We stayed at the nearby Hilton Bayside recently also. Except that the Hilton is newer and has a different feel, they were fairly comparable. We had a discount for the room which was nice because parking and internet use added another $40/nite which wasn't. Had we paid full price for the room, I suspect we would have been less pleased. On the other hand we paid $15 to park for a couple of hours at the US Grant for a wedding, perhaps the tariff to park in San Diego is average.

<Title>“good location, but no beach hotel”
<Content>The Manchester Grand Hyatt is probably the biggest hotel in San Diego. It consists of two interconnected towers. Due to the huge size of the hotel, the atmosphere is a little bit anonymous. I had room with a very beautiful view of the harbour bridge and the bay. My room had a decent size and the bed was very comfortable. The lobby area is quite impressive due to ultra-high ceilings (which is not unusual for Hyatt hotels). There is a bar on one of the upper floors that offers a great view of San Diego and the Bay/Harbour. There is also a pool area which has a decent size.

Upon arrival, i was exhausted so i ordered room service and I had the pleasure of speaking with Earl, Customer Service Supervisor. Earl was extremely accomodating, i could not have asked for better. Earl even delivered the food himself! Everyone was very very friendly and helpful. When i am in San Diego, i will be staying at the Manchester Grand again!

<Content>My husband and I had a commitment downtown San Diego (we are locals.) We got a AAA discount included a breakfast buffet. for a very reasonable price. They have this Internet program, where they offer upgrades at reasonable prices,so we got a huge suite (1000 sq.ft) It was wonderful. Our kids and grand kids joined us for a room service meal and some kid activities offered at the Hyatt. The Room Service food not the best,but had great service by the hotel personal. Clean Rooms. Wasn't quiet in the hallways, but then again,it's Saturday night (3am) and guests can be rude! Only stayed one night. Has a wonderful B. Buffet at one of the Hotel restaurants. while checking out,front desk informed us of a local rate. So next time we will request that while making a reservation!

<Title>“Fabulous hotel.....the rooms somewhat dated”
<Content>I stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San Diego for a nursing conference. The entrance, bar, restaurant and shops on the main level are truly beautiful!!! The rooms....not so much! This is one of the first hotels placed on directly on the San Diego Bay many years ago so I guess it's somewhat understandable that the rooms are dated. The furniture was somewhat older and there was a big tube TV in the dated armoire. For $250 a night, I expected a little more. However, the view of the bay was AMAZING!!!!! I could see Seaport Village, several restaurants, the Navy ships and even the bridge to Coronado Island! Who could ask for more!?! It truly made up for the older room. The windows open and the breeze coming off the water was awesome!!! The bar poured nice strong drinks. The sports bar/restaurant food was ok....nothing to write home about. I did not go to the pool, or the other restaurants. There is a free in-room safe and a refrigerator. The other things I did not like: NO free wifi...even in the main areas you had to pay!; $24.00 a day for parking....I guess that's the norm in a convention center area but sheesh! LOL! You also had to pay a daily fee for the fitness center (I believe it was $15.00) but I walked so much back and forth to the convention center and in Seaport Village, I didn't need to workout. Otherwise, this Hyatt is beautiful, the staff was great and other than the dated rooms it was an overall good experience!

<Content>Nice place, room was nice and the place was clean. The problem was the parking, we came back on a Sat. night (around 10pm) to find the hotel lot was full and there were a bunch of cars sitting waiting for some directions. I understood the $24 fee so I'm not upset with that but NOT to have enough parking for hotel guest is a serious issue for me. There were no conventions running this weekend (Memorial day) so how can a hotel of this size be out of parking for it's guest? Seems odd? I like the room and the place was nice but the parking issue would make me wonder if I would stay here again.....

<Content>Very Nice Hotel, Great location, Superb Staff. Everything one could want for a vacation right in one place. Join Gold Passport when you make your reservations, we got upgraded to a room on the 29th floor overlooking Coronado and the Bay... exquisite! We also were able to get a 2:00 check out which allowed us to enjoy our final day. Great swimming pools, good food, very very clean rooms with all the amenities you need. We'd like to make this our weekend getaway. Less than 10 minutes by taxi from the airport. Take the Gaslight Segway Tour with The Other Side of San Diego Tours and ask for Nick. An absolute MUST DO on your first day in the city. Some people on here have complained about the trains keeping them awake.... Not us, no problem, never heard one at night.

<Title>“Depends on which tower”
<Content>Stayed for a business meeting with a large number of attendees. Hotel well organized and helped us run a great meeting. Good location along the waterfront - with an easy walk to the Gas Lamp District. Rooms - depended on the tower - I was in the older of the two - Seaport is newer and updated. Older tower needed refreshing - old bathrooms, TV's. Beds were comfortable. They try to upsell you a waterview room - not worth it as most rooms will have a water view anyway. Not bad for bizness - not sure about romance.

<Title>“Had a great time at this hotel”
<Content>We stayed here on vacation for 4 nights in May and overall we had a really good time. Of course there are always pros and cons to every hotel. I will start with the pros: The location is near everything in downtown San Diego. You can walk everywhere easily. The views of the bay are amazing. I liked being next to seaport village and the gaslamp district. The service was great. Everyone was friendly and checkout was simple...no issues. Maid service was timely. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. I slept well every night despite all of the train and harbor noise. The common areas in the hotel are very elegant. I got a deal on our room so overall I was pleased. There were a few cons: I did not like their pool area. Most of the time they had it closed for maintenence. It seemed sort of blah if you ask me and I don't think I would have used it even if it was open. We walked next door to the Marriott and that pool is far superior, with waterfalls and firepits...the whole works. So if you are a big pool person, stay at the Marriott. The Hyatt caters to a convention crowd, so take note of that. We ate a very overpriced breakfast which I do not think was really worth it. Yes the rooms are a tad dated, esp. the bathrooms. But I didn't mind, because they were clean and everything worked correctly. I would stay at this Hyatt again because the service was good and they seemed to have everything together. Also take note that the trains can be loud, but good luck finding a quiet hotel in downtown San Diego.

Most rooms have a great view of both the beach and the downtown area. Great neighborhood. I felt comfortable walking alone. I love the location because it's on the beach, but close to the airport.

<Title>“Didn't get bed configuration reserved.”
<Content>We booked a room with a King bed months ago for our 25th anniversary and were placed instead in a room with two double beds. They made no attempt despite our multiple requests to remedy the situation other than checking the room allocations, which I wish they would have checked during the reservation process instead. We were told they had overbooked the king rooms and the bed configuration wasn't guaranteed. There was no obvious indication in the reservation process that we might end up in a type of room other than we booked. I definitely would have booked a room elsewhere if I had known there was a chance we would spend our 25th anniversary in double beds at the Hyatt. By the time we arrived it was too late to change to any of the adjacent hotels as they were already booked, but we certainly tried.

<Title>“Join Hyatt Gold Passport before you go, well worth it.”
<Content>I read all the reviews on Trip Advisor with mixed feelings! Join Gold Passport before you go, you get separate check-in, and possible up-grades, free gym (which is a great facility) and late check-out. Staff fantastic! Try and get in the newer tower ~ Seaport Tower. We upgraded to a Corner/King. We were very pleased with the location. OK there is some train noise, but nothing to get too upset with. The room probably needed updating, but suited us fine, especially with the drop-dead views from 3 floor-to-ceiling windows. Guests need to pick their priorities! View or plasma TV, what's important to them? The room was very comfortable and spacious. The foyer very grand, but I could see signs of ageing in the other areas. Overall it was a great 5 days, the location is terrific, walk to all the sights and down-town. I was there with my husband who was attending a conference.

<Title>“great location, great hotel”
<Content>Arrived late and slightly dubious given some previous reviews. Was upgraded to a premium view room. Check in was swift. Porter was excellent and explained all room amenities. Room was spacious, nice empty fridge to put own produce in. Decent coffee maker (although being picky would have preferred china cups instead of disposable cups but I know this is quite the norm in the states). Good amount of storage and nice spacious bathroom. Nothing to fault room wise. The decor is a little dated, but the king bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. I heard other people moaning that there were shower curtains over the bath instead of shower cubicles, but they were clean and totally prevented water from spilling on to the floor. The baths were the typical rather shallow american baths but there was nothing wrong with them. No the TV wasn't a plasma but then I dont go away to watch TV and as long as the picture is OK then I dont mind! Housekeeping was prompt and efficient, always plenty of towels and hot water. I am not usually a fan of the big buffet breakfast but found it to be delicious with plenty of choice and great service. The pool area was lovely, my only complaint would be with lazy guests who when they have finished around the pool are too idle to put their used towels in the large bin so other guests would know which loungers are available. The sun loungers had nice mattresses on them. There was a nice pool bar up on the sun terrace and food was delivered to the terrace via ordering over the telephones up by the pool. The food served up there was superb and I thoroughly recommend the Jerk Chicken Salad. The Top of the Hyatt Bar was ok. I prefer to be outdoors in such a beautiful place, the view was magnificent but I thought they could make more of it. Sallys on the water was great for sitting out on the waterfront sipping cocktails and we had a nice dinner there. I REALLY hope to return to San Diego (my husband was attending a conference) I have been to several American cities and it has to be my favourite. Climate superb (rubbish about gray May, it was incredibly sunny May), sea not to cold to swim in, dining out fantastic (quality rather than quantity) people charming, city immaculate. Loved the whole area and would without doubt stay in this location and hotel (- friends were at the Marriott next door which we liked a lot less, apart from Roys Bar where we drank cocktails outside most evenings). ONLY ONE COMPLAINT ABOUT WHOLE TRIP - THE TRAIN DRIVERS WHO SEEMED OBSESSED WITH HONKING THEIR HORNS SO LOUDLY ALL NIGHT. LOCALS LAUGHED BUT SAID THERE HAD BEEN A LOT OF ACCIDENTS - MY ANSWER INSTALL BARRIERS!!

<Content>Every employee I encountered was very friendly, anxious to please and make the stay enjoyable. Dinner in the restaurant was very good. Although my room was on the 14th floor and across from the train and light rail, I didn't notice when they came by unless I was looking for them. Good access to walk downtown.

<Title>“The service and the room was way below what I expect from a Hyatt”
<Content>They overbooked the hotel by 75 rooms. Our luggage was left in the middle of the entrance.with no one watching it. The rooms at the Hampton inn are much better. The breakfast service was terrible. There was a shortage of lounge chairs by the pool. There was no bar service by the pool. Overhaul I rate this place no stars.

<Title>“Great views, good food, but trains is the problem”
<Content>The hotel has a good location for conventions, ocean walks, etc. The staff is very courteous and attentive. When some problems occurred, they always took care and provided for some extras. The food was very good and Regency Club meals were nice. The bed is comfortable, which greatly helped with trying to sleep at night due to train noise. I stayed 5 nights, so eventual I got used to it, but may stay at different hotel next time due to such inconvenience. They provided me with nice bathroom amenities; although, the water in the sink was a bit too difficult to bring to correct temperature (the show was fine) - you have to carefully turn both knobs to get to the warm temperature. The parking is a bit expensive; although, self-parking is quite convenient. Free Internet and Fittness center access for Hyatt Elite Members. It is a good hotel overall except for train trucks nearby (which is the same problem with most hotel next to this Hyatt).

<Title>“I would rather stay in a cardboard box under a bridge than to have to return!”
<Content>Staff at the bell desk, valet parking and maintenance were all GREAT !!!!! It is really a shame their positives could not over come the laundry list of negatives. Room - Very run-of-the-mill overall. Furniture in need of updating despite our being in the "new" tower. 20" CRT TV with terrible reception. Beds were tolerable. Hot water and water pressure both were acceptable. Air Conditioning - Upon check-in we were given an "optional upgrade" for a premium view in the newer tower. We accepted the $25/day premium, and admittedly enjoyed the view. The only problem was that if you opened the drapes to look outside, the temperature increased exponentially. Our A/C thermostat was set to 68 degrees, but after only one hour of the drapes open, the temperature rose to 87 degrees in the room. We called maintenance, who was very friendly and attentive, but who told us we would have to keep the drapes closed if we wanted the room to be cool. This surprised us based on a 68 degree high temperature outside! To cool the room we had to prop the room's door open and run the A/C full out for two and one half hours.The next day we left the drapes pulled all day with the thermostat still set at 68 degrees, and the room still rose to 77 degrees. When I discussed this with the staff, they said that they had not heard the same from any other guests. At dinner that night we heard that three others from our group had also complained. Adjustments were made and our view mitigated from pulled drapes, and by ten o'clock it was bearable. Reservations/Confirmations - We arrived prior two days prior to some of the rest of our party, and when we checked in we re-confirmed their check-in schedule two days prior to their arrival. The day before, we also confirmed their arrival and reservations. We re-confirmed at two hours prior to their arrival - each time be assured that there were no problems and that their rooms were guaranteed for late arrival. One of the party was coming from Sweden (with his 8 year-old son), the other from Mexico City. Both arrived to find that they had been bumped due to over-booking. This despite our confirming and re-confirming as recent as two hours prior to arrival. The one traveling from Sweden, with his 8 year-old son, had been in airplanes/airports for 21 hours upon arrival to San Diego. Suffice to say that another delay just added insult to injury. No apology offered, only a voucher and a taxicab ride to a hotel back at the airport. Two hours later, they were finally in a room. After repeated requests for an explanation, the staff only offered that they could not help it, they were just overbooked. Shockingly, they even said that they had been inconvenienced "just as much as we were" with the overbooking! I discussed the entire situation with the Assistant GM, who I originally was told had left for the day and he guaranteed me that he would investigate and "get right back to me". He cared so much that he did not even bother to call back. UPS deliveries - On our third day we had a time sensitive package to be delivered by 8:00 AM. At 7:30 AM, I called both the front desk and the shipping and receiving department to have them "be on the lookout" for the package. At 8:05 AM, upon being notified by UPS that the package was delivered at 7:20AM, I called again to the front desk, the shipping department, the bell desk and the business center and was assured that it had not arrived. With my patience waning, I called the GM of the property. He assured me that he would personally investigate it and report his findings. He called in about one and a half hours to say that the package "was absolutely not on property nor had it been delivered - thus it is not our fault". Five and one half hours (and 27 telephone calls later) they found the package - sitting in the receiving department exactly where it was supposed to have been and that it had, in fact, been delivered at 7:20AM. Needless to say, after the emphatic denial I heard nothing more from the GM. No apology, no explanation, no effort to rectify - nothing - zilch - nada. The problems with this property are much deeper than just the philosophy of the upper management. We found them to be rude, indifferent and absolutely refused to accept responsibility for any of their numerous gaffs. I moved our entire party to the Marriott next door who were unbelievably and genuinely appreciative of our business. We also changed three dinners that had originally been scheduled for the Hyatt (a total of 37 meals and drinks). I wish that I felt that the Hyatt had learned from their mistakes but I seriously doubt it. The 14 hotel nights @ $280 each and the dinners/drinks would amount to something around $8000 of lost revenue, based on my estimation. I suppose that the Hyatt can afford walking away from the business. Do not be convinced for a moment that they care - as I have not received a single call from anyone in management regarding any of these issues. jcrowleyiv@tx.rr.com

<Title>“Good service and breakfast. Central to everything we needed”
<Content>My mom and I stayed here two nights and we really enjoyed the property. The hotel staff was very kind and courteous. Our check-in experience was quick and easy! The rooms were a good size, I'd ask for a room with a bay view. We ate in the hotel restaurant both days where there's a pretty good buffet and omelet station. The hotel is right on the Bay and pretty central to everything you'll need access to in San Diego (convention center, Gaslamp District, Shopping village behind the hotel, etc.). My only complaint would be for the parking - it was $24 a day which I felt was a little pricey. Other than that, I was very happy with the experience.

<Title>“What a nice hotel, for kids and adults!”
<Content>We spent the night in Downtown San Diego, as my son's only birthday wish was to enjoy a hotel night. (We first choose an uppity boutique hotel (Se Hotel), because they were amazingly offering a great deal. We called to confirm our double bed (family of 4), and they flat out refused, and even after talking to the manager, they recommended we cancel our reservations!) . What a good thng though, because we then proceeded to book at the Manchester Hyatt, a hotel where I have taken family for drinks at the top of the hotel (gorgeous views), but never stayed at. The rooms were clean. We stayed in the newer of the two towers, so I don't know if the previous reviewer's who had outdated rooms were in the older of the towers or not. Our room was pretty modern, and nice. Beds were a little soft, but very plush and overall comfortable. We loved eating lunch at the Redfield's Sports Bar. Even though my daughter accidentally spilled (and broke!) a glass, they were were nice and smiling the whole way. We sat in the Grand Lobby Bar and had some drinks before dinner, and the kids played Go Fish. Service was great. We walked to Gaslamp for dinner. We had breakfast the next morning at Lael's, and they had a wonderful buffet, with an omlette bar. Overall, wonderful experience, and the kids loved it. Would do it again at the same place!

<Title>“I was cheated!!”
<Content>The Hyatt Manchester in San Diego is probably above average level. I was very upset because they advertise that if you go to the ball game and the San Diego Padres win through a "grand slam" (home run) one would get 50% off the grand total. This was my case (Friday 16 of April 2010) and it was even shown with big fire works in the Ballpark monitor! For my surprise, they told me at the reception desk that it would apply on my next stay! I told the manager in charge that I felt cheated and that they had done a great job in loosing a customer and that I would do any effort possible NOT to recommend their facilities (most probably they do not care a bit).

<Title>“So disappointed, stay at the Embassy Suites across the street”
<Content>Check in was the only half way decent experience. We paid for a suite, it was in need of a good cleaning. The furniture was "very well worn" lamp shades barely able to stay on the lamp, dust, old TV's, you name it. In room directory gave names and menu's of restaurant located in the hotel, that had been closed for months. No real glass wear in the wet bar, only paper cups. We could have stayed at a motel for that kind of stuff. Went to the bar at the top of the hotel, only to have dirty tables, old stall smell of beer, not very inviting. The windows in our room, bar and even the hallways are so dirty you can't even see the beautiful view. I wrote a letter of complaint on their "please let us know" form to management, over 4 months ago, no response. This is hardly the place to stay when in San Diego, way too overpriced. Unfortunately, it was our wedding anniversary. We know better now.

<Title>“Been here many times, would like to go elsewhere”
<Content>I have stayed at this hotel four times now, all for conferences. It's like I'm trying to punish myself each time I come here, but in all honesty, it's just easier for me to stay in a hotel where the conference is located. With that said, here is my only recommendation for this hotel, otherwise you'll never get sleep, get a room that is far away from the front of the hotel and faces inwards. Yes, that means you have to look at other people about 100 yrds away, but trust me on this one. The "Night Train" blares it's freight horn every hour on the hour starting about 10 PM and ending around 6 AM. And if that horn isn't going the cruise ships coming into port sure are. The food is just blah, no place to really eat in the hotel. You should go into town, hit up the Gas Lamp District for bad food and tourist traps.

<Title>“Better off down staying down the street for half the price”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel because our conference was held here. The lobby area is beautiful and the service and location were great but unfortunately the negatives outweigh the positives on this one. I think Hyatt spent all of their efforts and money on the common areas because the rooms are outdated, especially the bathrooms, and the windows are dirty on the outside so you can't really appreciate the wonderful view. The tub drain wouldn't stay up so I had to hold it while all of the water drained out. The next day we had ants up on the bathroom counter (and we hadn't had any food in there). we had the same old TV in our house 15 years ago. I agree with a previous review that the valets and doormen were excellent and very helpful in getting cabs and providing information. The beds were comfortable.Overall, we had a better experience for half the price down the street at another chain hotel the first half of the week with breakfast, fitness center and happy hour receptions included!

<Content>My wife and I spent a 4 day mini-vacation at the Manchester Grand and even though the view was spectacular the rooms could use some updating i.e. replace the crt tvs with flat screens and get better reception. The food was very good albiet a tad pricey. The cleaning satf was very courteous and efficient , the same could not be said for the Bell staff. The main pool was under repair, an email alerting patrons would have soothed some ruffled feathers. Overall experience was fine.

<Title>“Not the usual Hyatt”
<Content>Although I never had any real problems, this Hyatt isn't up to the standard I associate with the chain. Rooms are average quality; mine was very clean and nicely maintained by the housekeeping staff. It bothered me that the used room service trays seemed to remain in the hall ways for almost 24 hours. I appreciated the location being so close to the village and nearby the convention center, but the Marriott is closer still and seemed nicer. With proximity comes noise though and I found the rooms exceptionally noisy between external horns (trains or boats?) and poor sound insulation between rooms. The restaurants within the building have good food but are very overpriced. Lael's breakfast buffet was about $25 per person and had good selections. I LOVE breakfast buffets and will always use one but when all I want is eggs and sausage there sure is a penalty for my indulgence. The lobby bar service was exceptionally slow, so bring a newspaper. The highlight of the hotel was the terrific doorman staff. They efficiently got my taxis for me and made sure the drivers knew exactly where I wanted to go. A small touch that is very appreciated for an out of towner.

<Title>“Just average, rooms need updating”
<Content>The location is great if you are attending a meeting at the convention center. Great view. The food was average, the rooms could be renovated and the cleaning staff could do a better job. The common areas, the lobby and bar were great. There are no real options for breakfast, just buffet for $50 for 2 people! There is a small shopping village behind hte hotel where you can grab a reasonable lunch. Concierge is very helpful and most restaurants in the gaslamp district are walkable, cheaper and have better food. Not worth the money.

<Content>My husband and I decided on a "staycation" and got a great rate at the Hyatt for a Friday night. It is a great location as it is right next to Seaport Village and the Gaslamp district which is a must for any tourist visiting downtown. The room was beautifully appointed with a wondeful bed. The shower was fantastic but there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom. They dont yet have flat screen TV's in their rooms but we werent there to watch TV so we could care less. We had a wonderful view of the bay. The staff was very nice and check in via the web was a nice feature. They had a nice breakfast buffet at Lael's restaurant and good service. This one is a no brainer. Worth every penny.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>You can't beat the location of this hotel - right next to Seaport Village and within walking distance of the waterfront, pier, etc. Also, the views are great. The rooms are just so-so, really nothing special. I traveled for business, and I don't think I'd stay at this hotel if my company hadn't paid for it! Just too expensive. A few notes: Internet access costs $12.95 per day. What a joke! Use of the fitness center costs $5.00 per day. Another joke! Elevators are speedy and efficient - I don't think I ever waited more than 60 seconds. The ballroom/conference facilities are very nice. I did not hear the trains at night, as some other reviewers had mentioned. I think it depends on which way your room faces. The catered food was just so-so. I've had better, but I've had worse too! One final tidbit/oddity: The front desk called our room at 7:34am one morning and said that they had a work order for the room next door. They were "calling to see if we were in our room" (i.e. if they could work next door). I was like, good grief, its 7:34am of course we're in our room, and we were SLEEPING until you called". Definitely a WTF moment!

<Title>“Not so great hotel but the location is convenient”
<Content>Just got back from a 5 night stay at the Manchester Grand Hyatt. My husband was attending a conference and I tagged along. We stayed at this same hotel several years ago and our stay then was fine. This trip, we both realized that while we love the location of the hotel, the hotel itself is not that great. On the positive, the location is right near the Gaslamp district and in close proximity to the Seaport Village so it was nice to be able to walk to shopping and dining. We did have a nice view from our room of the pool and the water. We saw some great sunsets but the windows were so FILTHY the pictures just showed the extensive brown dirt on the windows. They are long overdue cleaning the windows. My problems with this hotel are: Housekeeping/daily maid service was horrible. The bed was made up each day and towels were refreshed as necessary but beyond that, they didn't empty the trash in the bedroom area, didn't provide clean glasses (I had to find the maid to get new glasses) never vacuumed the room, didn't even show up one day until after 6:00 pm when I called TWICE to ask that our room be serviced. Restaurants were not good. Food in the sports bar was not good and the menu was very limited. One drink with premium gin was 9.00 at the bar. So, a 1/3 lb. burger with one cocktail was 25.00. Now, if the burger were great, I wouldn't have felt badly. But it was not good at all. We did order room service one night and it was pretty good, but they left our tray outside our door over 24 hours. I had to call twice to get them to finally come pick it up. It was probably our tray that the other reviewer is referring to! They also left bundled up dirty sheets in the hallway alot, too. I could never figure out why. Also, they have limited tv channels! They have network and a few others like ESPN, etc. They closed the pool one day at 2 for a private function. Since it was the only really nice "pool" day, I was not happy at all about that. Then there is the train. ALL DAY AND NIGHT LONG that TRAIN blew its horn several times to where it woke us up every night! Now parking. We got a rental car but returned it a day later because self parking at this hotel is $22.00 a day! This hotel clearly caters to the convention crowd and since I wasn't part of that, I can't speak for how they handle the meeting aspect of it, but if you are a leisure traveler, find another place to stay. There is a beautiful Marriott very close by.

<Title>“great location but hotel needs updating”
<Content>We stayed with our whole family for spring break and combo convention for daughter and son-in-law. I agree with the other reviews about the train noise at night, it is loud. The bed was comfortable but the maid never could make the sheets stay fitted. The buffet at the hotel both breakfast and dinner were great, lots of choices and everything was really good. The staff at all the eateries were very helpful and showed they enjoyed their work. The shops at the village were a great location and made a beautiful trip close by. I also agree with the other reviewers about the rooms needing updating and its o.k. to show pictures of who started the hotel but it was somewhat over the top. My big problem was the Top View Bar which had great views but I expected a exclusive club with a nice dress code and maybe a jazz music instead people were walking in in shorts and cutoffs like they were on the beach and the loud music could be different. It could be a nice upscale club, as it was promoted. The young people would learn to dress up and go to a nice club like the many upscale clubs in New York, LA, or Vegas.

<Title>“Mediocre Hotel”
<Content>I stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt in May of 2009 and the accomodations were so-so. I am a busines professional that travels quite a bit for business and leisure and this hotel would rank average for me. If you are staying here for business then you will enjoy your stay. The hotel is close to the waterfront and a short distance from the downtown area. However, if you are looking for a leisure stay then there are definitely better hotels in the area.. starting with the Marriott next door. I arrived on a Thursday night a at 8:30pm and attempted to grab drinks and appetizers in the hotel lobby bar and they were already closing down for the evening. The next day I was relaxing at the pool and noticed you were not able to order food or drinks in the pool area. If you wanted to place an order you had to find a standing phone, guess your order (no menus or staff onsite), and request it from room service. Overall, if you are looking for a luxury resort then this is not your hotel. The lobby and grounds are beautiful.. but the service and accomodations do not make this a must stay.

<Title>“Best Views in San Diego”
<Content>The Manchester Grand is a lovely hotel with a spectacular lounge, Top of the Hyatt, where you will find locals and visitors alike. Most rooms are spacious and have water views and the King Room with windows on two sides is well worth the extra fee. The location is great as Seaport Village is at your doorstep and for those who love to walk there is the Maritime Museum, Gaslamp Quarter, Petco Park, Horton Plaza and a plethora of fabulous restaurants along the way. Add in Balboa Park, the San Diego Zoo and the beaches and what's not to love? Anyway, I love staying at this hotel when I return to my home town. And my son's who are still in San Diego love visiting the hotel each time, (Back to the Top of the Hyatt...) ; )

<Title>“Wonderful hotel”
<Content>We stayed at the hotel in the Harbor Tower for 4 nights Our room had a view of the harbor which included the Midway and the cruise ships that were in port. The room was spacious and very clean. the bed was very comfortable. We had a breakfast buffet at the hotel included with our room. It included an extensive amount of food including some of the best waffles with fruit and cream ever! The only problem we had was noisy neighbors in the adjacent room who came in at about 3 am and slammed their door and proceeded to talk loudly for a few hours and kept us awake! The left the next night and we had a quiet night's sleep then.

<Title>“Beware of this hotel!”
<Content>Don't be fooled by the gorgeous lobby/exterior, location, and fabulous views! All these things are true, but that's where the good qualities end--if that's enough for you, enjoy your stay! The staff is rude and extremely incompetent, the rooms are dirty and out-dated, limited laundry and it's quite dingy. I made an official complaint against this hotel to the corporate office and was given compensation, due to the severity of their offenses. The staff at Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego never apologized for their wrong-doing. Be wary of this facility, there are much better establishments in the area.

<Title>“Not worth it... MANY other beautiful new hotels in SD”
<Content>Although the service was top-notch and all personnel were friendly and helpful, this hotel is in desperate need of an update. Decor has seen it's better days. Rooms look stuck in the 80's with lots of burgundy & hunter green color schemes and beat-up dark cherry furniture with brass accents. The photo homage to the wealthy, conservative "who's who" of the Republican Party in the lobby could also be a turn-off to some, but perhaps those are the kinds of people this hotel appeals to... maybe Doug Manchester's new trophy wife should suggest a redo.

<Content>Stayed here after a software conference in Newport Beach, Ca. We got a crazy deal on it through Priceline. The location was great for us to walk everywhere we wanted to go. It was close to good shopping and restaurants as well as the waterfront. We upgraded our reservation to an oceanview and enjoyed the view. Hyatt rooms always smell fresh and clean and the beds are ultra comfortable. Didn't spend a whole lot of time in the room. Highly recommend the zoo and Sea World.

<Title>“Awesome Hotel, Service & Views!”
<Content>I was planning our 25th wedding anniversary - I'm a real planner and a wannabe travel agent and get a thrill out of doing my research thru all of the travel sites and reviews. I have been unemployed for a year, staying locally (we are San Diego Natives) was not part of the plan but as the time drew nearer, it was clear we had no choice. So, after TONS of research and wanting this trip to be as special as possible, I chose the Manchester Grand Hyatt, Corner King Room and was NOT disappointed!! We booked right thru the Hyatt site and they offered a Sunshine Sale - stay 3 nights, get the 3rd night free, what a deal! I had made several minor requests and they honored all of our requests which made our stay unforgettable! From the moment we checked in, the service was impeccable! The room was over-sized, decorated very nicely and was very clean! The view has got to be the best in the city in their Corner King Room with a view of the bay from one side to the other as well as downtown. Tons of restaurants to choose from in easy walking distance as well as Hyatt's own excellent restaurants, Sally's was spectacular & Redfield's Deli serves Starbucks coffee! We have never stayed at a hotel of this caliber so the price, considering I am unemployed, was a bit high HOWEVER, the view was well worth the price. As I mentioned, we are SD Natives so didn't feel the pressure to get out and see the sites, we thoroughly enjoyed our room and the million dollar view. From what I could see, I think all rooms have wonderful views, regardless of whether you have a corner room or not but the corner king room was extra special. We ate at Seaport Village at the Harbor House several times and at Donovan's Steak House which did not disappoint!! I saved for a few months so we did not have to scrimp and thanks to the Hyatt, we had a very special 25th wedding anniversary. We are already planning our next anniversary here and can't wait!

<Title>“Excellent Hotel”
<Content>We have stayed at numerous Hyatt Hotels, but the Manchester Grand Hyatt is now one of our favorites. My wife and I stayed there with friends to celebrate New Year's 2010 and take in a few extra days of relaxation. We found the staff to be superior ... from the bellman and the front desk staff to the individual housekeeper that cares for your room ... we found them all to be friendly, helpful, and above the norm. The food was excellent, and the service in their restaurants superior. The hotel's location is convenient to the Gas Lamp District, the Midway Museum, and their commuter rail system.

<Title>“Perfect Location - Very Nice”
<Content>Well this is a little overdue considering it has been well over a year since we stayed at the Hyatt, but I figured better late than never. Overall this was a great hotel and I would recommend it to anyone visiting the San Diego area. In fact, we did recommend it to my parents and they ended up staying there and loving it as well. The location was absolutely perfect...right on the bay (nice view from all rooms) within a short walk of the Gaslamp area, Seaport Village is right outside the door, the U.S.S Midway and the ferry to Coronado are just a few blocks away, the water taxi stops just a block or so away, and the train stops right in front of the hotel if you want to venture further from the hotel. Some reviewers have complained about the noise from the train....you could hear the train, but in my opinion it was just background noise that you would hear at any hotel in the dowtown area of any major city... nothing to worry about. The rooms were very nice and like I said before they had a great view of the bay. Our only minor complaint was that when we checked in we were told that they did not have a room with a king bed or a view over the pool so we brought our stuff up to the room they gave us. On our way down we talked to someone else about letting us know when a different room was available. She said a king room overlooking the pool was currently available and seemed confused as to why we were told otherwise when we checked in. Anyway, they had our new room ready immediately so it was no big deal. I guess it was just a one-off issue with one of the people at the front desk. We had a great time and honestly didn't have enough time in San Diego. Sea World was probably our highlight...just amazing. I'm glad we went to the zoo, but it really is just like any other zoo, just a little bigger maybe. Seaport Village was great for a morning walk and to do some shopping. Had a great day at Pacific Beach....Lahainas was a great bar right on the beach. We also spent a night out in PB at PB Bar and Grill which we liked as well. Coronado Beach was beautiful and so was the hotel there. We liked all the restaraunts we tried. I'd recommend Island Prime (amazing view), Gaslamp Strip Club (grill your own steaks), The Fish Market (great fish, right on the water), The Yardhouse (great beer selection), and Nicky Rotten's (great burger bar and grill). Revisiting all this is making me want to go back....and the first place I'd check is the Hyatt.

<Title>“Locaton is great; the introduction to the bathroom was yikes! and can't they afford fitted sheets?”
<Content>We stayed here Dec. 28-Jan 1. The check-in was smooth and no questions asked when we checked in at 2 PM. I don't even remember seeing a check-in and check-out time stated on literature until I asked the night before departure. Check-out was at noon but we were offered a later check-out if we wished. Our room was on the 14th floor with a view to the bay, the Mid-way carrier, lovely night lights and the "Holiday Bowl" parade prior the big game on Dec. 30th. Arriving in the room it seemed smaller than many but just fine. The bathroom, however, had been "worked on" (looked like someone had accessed the ceiling) and the floor was full of gritty pieces of (looked like) plaster and dirt. The bathtub was the same. Doesn't anyone check conditions after sending in someone to do repair in a room? Housekeeping came in about 10 minutes and the housekeeper was great and apologetic; she swept, vacuumed, mopped, changed out the towels. Obviously no one had informed her of the situation. After the first night we made our own bed, per usual, and noted that our toes could touch the mattress pad because the flat sheet used on the bottom barely covered the length of the bed. Would have like a fitted sheet there. (Who else's toes had touched the mattress bad and were their feet clean?) Location was great for access to Seaport Village, the ferry to Coronado Island, the Gaslamp District, the trolley, the bus. Aside from New Year's Eve loud hallway noises, it was a fairly quiet room. Lots of options for dining nearby and in the hotel. We chose the deli a couple of times and the salads and sandwiches were fine.

<Title>“Nice Hotel - Great location”
<Content>I have stayed at this hotel on a few occasions and twice in December 2009. This hotel is just great. Located close to the gas lamp district (about a 10 minute walk) and many rooms have a great view of the bay. The hotel has a grand lobby and 2 towers. The front staff are very nice and helpful. The check in and out process was a breeze and very easy. The rooms are very clean and adequate. A bit outdated though and no LCD TV but still more than comfortable. There is self park and valet parking. The self parking was at $22/day. There is a beatiful pool outside, chairs and games. The gym is alos great. I would certainly stay at this hotel again.

<Content>My husband and I stayed here for the Holiday Bowl, as it was the official hotel for the team. It wasn't a great experience. Room furnishings were old and dreary, bathroom had scant amenities. In-room dining was horrible as food quality was very poor. Spa nail services were awful. The only thing my husband and I enjoyed at the spa were the massages we both had. The only nice thing about this hotel were the great location and views of the bay.

<Title>“Oldie but goodie - pros outweigh the cons”
<Content>Yes, the rooms are horribly outdated and need remodeling! Despite that, this hotel is in a perfect location for those wanting to be close to the action in downtown San Diego. Located near everything...convention center, Gas Lamp district, etc. this hotel can't be beat for those wishing to walk most places. Check in was a breeze and extremely friendly and professional. Despite booking on priceline for $68 a night, I was treated well and given a high floor with a pretty decent view. As mentioned by every other reviewer, the rooms need to come into the new millenium. The lack of flat screen tvs, modern furnishings, and comfortable beds is noteworthy. Rooms, however, are clean and have duvets and a refrigerator. Bathroom is fine as well and in line with this type of hotel. Water pressure was notably good. Didn't use the pool but it looked nice and there are nice gas fire pits around the pool that were very relaxing for a glass of wine before hitting the town. Parking is a rip off at $22 a day but there are no real alternatives around so you are stuck with it. At least they have a nice parking garage. Also, the internet is $10 a day....a rip off again that these 4* level hotels seem comfortable with while everyone else lets you have it for free. Overall, a good stay at the Hyatt Regency Manchester. I spent a lot more time in the room than I expected due to food poisoning from the Urban Bar & Grille in the Gas Lamp area... I recommend avoiding that restaurant! Otherwise, great hotel in a beautiful city but the renovations need to begin soon.

Great restaurants in Downtown/Gaslamp are a short walk or cab ride away. Redfields(sportsbar in hotel) has the BEST BLOODY MARYS and are $6 on SUndays-also great service. Skip Sallys on the Water(in hotel)-it was just so-so. We would like to mention and thank employee BILL EASTER for making our stay so specia(. He is a club host and banquet captain, but should be promoted to Hotel PRESIDENT!!!!) Bill went above and beyond to find iced christmas cookies for our 5-year-old and made us feel like VIPs!!!! We are returing to the area in March, and though we have been asssigned to another hotel, we plan to do our best to change our reservation to THIS WONDERFUL property!

<Title>“Great Location, Beautiful Lobby, Rooms from the 80's, Poor Service”
<Content>This hotel is within walking distance to everything you could ever want in downtown San Diego. The lobby is beautiful, but that is where it stops. Multiple things in the room were filthy and required attention. The bathroom needs a big re-do and the tv's are small, CRT's. All decor is from the 80's at best. Elevator waits can be very poor at peak times, and I waited over 10 minutes to PLACE a room service order. Overall, the service was far worse than I get from Courtyards and Hampton's which are in a class well below the Grand Hyatt. Since this is a GRAND Hyatt, I had much higher expectations....

<Title>“Adequate”
<Content>I stayed here for three nights while attending a conference at the convention center. The lobby of the hotel was very impressive but my "premium view" room was merely adequate. I believe I was in the older of the two towers. My view was quite nice but the room was underwhelming - old style CRT TV, small bathroom, typical hotel furniture. The service was good and the location is convinient to downtown and the waterfront. I would probably stay here again but insist on staying in the newer tower which I assume is nicer.

<Title>“Great Convention Hotel, Knows How to Treat its Good Customers”
<Content>Having just had an appalling visit to the Mission Bay Hyatt, I decided to give the Manchester Grand Hyatt a try the following week. What a difference. This is a vast convention oriented hotel but service is not compromised. Despite the bargain rate I received on Hyatt.com, I was treated as a VIP from the second I made the reservation. Follow up call to make sure my needs were met. This hotel knows how to treat GP Diamond members. Great central location, huge meetings spacings, nice health club. I was in the older tower and the room was a bit tired but I can't really complain. The "Grand Club" included a nice food presentation several times a day and all in all this was a very pleasant stay. I will be returning on my next visit to San Diego in a week.

<Content>What a nice suprise. After reading some of the reviews I was hesitant to stay here yet form the moment I arrived, I have been treated wonderful. First a mistake with the room was handled within moments and that has set the tone. The gym is great, the pool is clean, the food is good. Everyone is so helpful and friendly, I really enjoyed it. Good place to stay for business, can't beat the location. For a car, try Enterprise downtown, they bent over backwards as well. I rented a compact and was upgraded to what a chrysler 300. They picked me up at the hotel and dropped me back off when I returned the car. All in all very happy with the hotel. It is kind of sad to see the city so down on its luck compared to two years ago, when I was last in town for a convention. The shops and cafes are virtually empty or closed.

We were throwing a going away party for a friend. The pool area is very nice and staying here allows you access to all the greatness that downtown SD has to offer. There are some good restaurants and lounges at the hotel as well.

<Content>We stayed here for seven nights on the Club floor. I was a little disappointed. It is just an hotel room..... nothing special. The food on the Club floor is , again, nothing special! Spectacular views though The staff are all very friendly. And professional. We had breakfast downstairs in the main restaurant a couple of times. Or tried to have breakfast there. There is always a long line, waiting for a table. At least a 15 minute wait just for the table. Really, for an hotel of this size, they should have a bigger restaurant for breakfast. But dinner there was great!!! It is convenient to the convention centre and the gaslight area. And the whole area was nice. Just not special!

We actually walk to USS Midway from our hotel and enjoyed the afternoon in the village. It is also just 5 minutes drive to Coronado. The room is clean and the customer service is wonderful. We have a baby so we requested a crib. The staff also set up a microwave in our room, so we can warm up the milk conveniently. By the way, my toddler loves the ocean view. He could look at the ocean for hours! We would love to stay at this hotel next time we go to SD.

<Title>“Extremely good stay - pleasantly surprised”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. I had a corner room on a higher floor (13th? 15th?) and from there I had a view of both downtown and Coronado Island across the bay. I could see the cruise ships, sailboats, tugboats, and military ships cruising the bay as well as the beautiful city lights at night. I had been to this hotel before for Comicon, but I did not spend the night there. Based on my visit (lobby areas) I didn't expect much. Typical Vegas-style chain hotel. However, my stay was great! Room was spacious and well-appointed with free Internet, refrigerator, sitting area, and working area. Bathroom was less upscale and more pedestrian. Parking was good. I used both the valet and self-parking. Location was nice. I was able to walk to Seaport Village for breakfast and it wasn't *too* much of a walk to Gas Lamp or Little Italy in the evenings as well as the USS Midway and the contemporary art museum. If you have business at the convention center (I didn't) it's just one hotel over. It wasn't as convenient to downtown as some of the other hotels, being more on the periphery of town. The lounge on the top floor has beautiful views. Pool area was very nice with two jacuzzis. Only complaint is that the food is expensive and mediocre. I would probably rate 4 stars, but I am rating 5 stars because my room and the view were so lovely. I would definitely ask for a corner room again, even if it costs more. A stay in an inner room would be less pleasant. One big negative was the train. The tracks are right outside the hotel and there is not only the constant trolley traffic, but also fully loaded freight trains passed in front of the hotel with a lot of attendant whistle-sounding. The city needs to do something about this by rerouting the trains or something. I didn't mark this hotel down because almost all hotels will suffer from the problem. Same with the occasional horns from the ships, one of which woke me up out of a sound sleep. However, that only happened once during the stay. I was pretty pissed at the time, but when it didn't recur I got over it. Again, the hotel gets a pass because you can hear a noise that loud from everywhere. However, I do business in San Diego fairly often and I would definitely stay here again. They seem to be having occupancy problems and rates are ridiculously low for what you receive.

<Title>“Promptly addressing the needs & generous in giving”
<Content>While visiting my son over the weekend in SD, we stayed @ Hyatt. @ 2am in the morning, next door guest had about 15+ people partying loudly. We called the front desk. They sent guard up immediately to handle the situation. The next day we inquired about their all you can eat breakfast. The front desk woman asked the size of our party and gave all 4 of us free breakfast buffet that's the price of $25/person. We were pleasantly surprised by their generosity. We will definitely consider returning soon. The hotel is also grandly designed.

<Title>“Beyond my exectations”
<Content>I recently stayed at the Manchester Hyatt San Diego for three days. I was very please with the service from the from desk to maid services. The hotel has outstanding facilities, the rooms are pretty average for a Hyatt hotel but the size are acceptable. The hotel is divided in two towers one of them has been completed renovated in 2007. I stayed at the old tower but I did not see any of the complaints from previous travelers. I went to the free gym (there is another one for club members only) but it was more than what I needed the equipment was excellent and the gym was very clean. The pool is managed just like any other big resort with full day of activities (most of the free of charge) I was there for a conference I was also very impress with the ballrooms and the business center. I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone specially families.

<Title>“Ants, Ants and Ants”
<Content>I recently stayed at the Hyatt for a conference for three nights. The hotel is large and can accomodate multiple conferences as it did easily. I stayed in what was obviously the 'older ' part of the hotel, with frayed and stained carpets. There were ants in my bathroom, the first night, I was late arriving and did not notice; the second day I saw one or two. This worried me, but I overlooked it, thinking that this would be cleaned by housekeeping. Wrong! By the last morning of my stay, there was a parade of ants, stretching from the back wall to underneath the sink. I finished as soon as I could and got out of the room. at checkout when I informed the associated at the desk, she was apologetic and promised to take care of it. Interestingly, I overheard another guest complaining of the same problem that day. What amazed me, is the fact that this hotel caters to many guests and if multiple (at least 2 to my knowledge) guests have the same complaint, please take care of it; and while you are at it, it might be a good idea to give your guests some form of compensation; either a gift cerificate or some credit for their stay. Anyways, I think I may have to give this hotel a bye in the future and stay at any of the hotels in the same neighbourhood and price range.

<Title>“Great Weekend Stay at Manchester Grand Hyatt”
<Content>We visited San Diego the first weekend of October. Got the Manchester Grand Hyatt for a great rate on Priceline. Despite having an outrageously low rate for the weekend we were greated with a smile upon check-in and were able to get our room early (10:30 am). The room was on the 14th floor with a fantastic view of the Harbor and Seaport Village. The room was very clean and had adequate bathroom ammenities. If we had neighbors on either side of us we couldn't tell. There was no noise from other rooms as some have complained about.The houskeeping staff was very effecient and gladly provided us with additional packets of Starbucks decaf coffee upon our request. We did not eat at the hotel so cannot comment on their dinning services. The hotel is very conveniently located close to all areas of downtown and we were able to walk to almost everywhere we went with the exception of the zoo. Walked to Petco Park for the last Padre's game of the season (they lost to the Giants). Seaport Village is literally in the backyard of the Hyatt with many choices for dining and shopping. The wife and I rode the merry go round at Seaport Village. All in all I would recomend the Manchester Grand Hyatt to anyone visiting San Diego you won't be dissapointed.

<Title>“elegant, grand, fantastic location”
<Content>This was the largest and grandest hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. The location was superb and the views outstanding. I stayed on the Club Floor in the Horizon tower and the room was lovely. Amenities, service and food in the Club Lounge were very good and the view was fantastic. I enjoyed spending the early evenings there basking in the beauty of the sunsets and munching on some freshly baked cookies. Staff were very courteous and helpful and even though the hotel is on a grand scale I was made to feel very welcome.

<Content>We stayed for 5 nights durung a conference. The prices were outrageous . They had us captive because the conference was held there and the prices were premium,. The staff tried hard and were a great bunch of young people. On entering the room we noticed a very large unappetizing strain on the floor, saw tiny bottles of drinking water in a row with $4.50 prices tags, tiny motel quality soap which smelled Awful in the bathroom and then there was "the noise". ...walls are paper thin. We heard our neighbours sneeze, play tv late in the night and speak in loud whispers. Very unnerving. Internet was a fortune...three over priced computers for a conference hotel ! The hostess in Sally's Restaurant was surly and the food overpriced . Sorry but Never again.

<Content>This was my second time staying here and it was very pleasant. I was a little worried at first because the recent posts had many complaints about the quality degrading in the rooms. We had a room in the Seaport Tower (the newer one) and it was fabulous. Even though we booked through Priceline, we got a room that faced both the bay and the city. The front desk was very helpful, the location very ideal. We never had to drive. I would definitely recommend it!

<Title>“Awesome”
<Content>This was our favorite hotel on our trip down from San Francisco. The lobby is very grandeur, a very nice first impression. The service is considerate, fast and accomodating at check-in. We stayed in the Seaport Tower overlooking the bay-nice. Upscale toiletries were provided. Buffet breakfast was delicious-wide variety of hot foods and fruit-everything you can think of to eat for breakfast was there. Two jacuzzis on pool floor with fire pit for those relaxing evenings. No need to pay for valet or self-parking as we found free parking on street(free after 6 pm until 8 am) and during the day you can park a few hours at Seaport Village and get parking ticket validated with a purchase or park at the mall near Gaslamp District a few hours to get your parking ticket validated there from machines in the mall.

<Content>The hotel is located in downtown San Diego and all the city attraction are within walking distance. Even though it's gear more to business side, but we still enjoy it as a family. The room is clean but on the small side. The view is fantastic looking toward the harbor. One con is that the parking rate is very high, $18. I would stay at this hotel again if they offer free full breakfast at laurel again.

<Title>“Everything you need under the sun”
<Content>For our first trip to San Diego I researched area hotels and decided upon the Manchester Grand Hyatt for the value and location. It's centrally located near major attractions like the Gas Lamp District and the San Diego Harbor. We stayed in a city view king room that was well kept and comfortable. Overall the hotel is nice, I wouldn't say it is ultra modern or outdated, it is right in the middle. There's a small pool with lounge chairs on the fourth floor that overlooks the harbor - great play to sunbathe on hot day. Concierge is really helpful in planning activities and booking tickets in advance. I really liked the restaurants and shops by the harbor, I believe it is called the San Diego village. It's a good place to pick up souvenirs or cheap food since you can likely pick up a hefty tab at most of the restaurants in the hotel. There's a pizza, Mexican, Mediterranean, and ice cream joints. It's also a good place to catch the sun set along with a cheap pitcher of beer. Speaking of which, you MUST go to the top of the Hyatt and enjoy the views -- again on both sides of the lounge you can enjoy city views and harbor views. Great place to go for moderately priced drinks and watch the sun set. We even got complimentary champagne and took plenty of pictures! One thing to watch out for is the extra charges to use the gym. It's $5/day or $10/3days. Internet, like most hotels cost extra too. Overall we really enjoyed our stay. One last tip is to go to Sally's restaurant and get the crab sandwich or crab Benedict. The lumps of crab were AMAZING.

<Title>“Nice Hotel”
<Content>This was a nice hotel with a great location. We chose it because of it's proximity to Seaport Village, which is directly outside the hotel. In the summer, Seaport Village is open later, so it's nice to be able to walk around and shop late into the evening. The room was clean with plenty of room. We had a double with a rollaway and we did not feel crammed at all. I would definitely recommend it. A little over priced, but the hotel is a nice one.

<Content>I was very impressed with the grand entrance to the hotel and the lobby. Very classy and sophisticated. BUT it ends there. I stayed in the horizon tower on the 27th floor. The view is amazing. The room is very mediocre. No robes, no slippers. The bathroom needs an update badly. The sink faucets are old making the spray very hard. The towels are very cheap and rough. The beds are okay but not really at all inviting. They charge to use internet in the room and there is no free access in the entire hotel. It does not deserve its 5 stars. I also stayed in the W hotel and it was great.

<Content>We stayed in a room on the 31st floor of the north tower. The view was unbelievable with floor to ceiling windows. The ceiling was quite high so it felt quite roomy sunny and open. All staff were polite and helpful. The two main upper scale restaurants were very good. The others were mediocre. I would be sure to enjoy a drink and sunset from the lounge on the top floor but I would not waste my money on the appetizers or desserts that are offered there. The pool area is very nice. The decor is beautiful.

<Title>“if you get a good nightly rate, it's worth the stay”
<Content>The Good: The staff is very friendly and helpful. We had a hot water problem in our room, and the hotel operator sent an engineer right up. He fixed it immediately. Also, they allowed us to check out late (3pm!). The hotel lobby is great. Lots of amenities right in the hotel. We tipped the housekeeping staff a couple dollars a day, and they were so appreciative…thanked us multiple times. The reason I gave the hotel three stars... (1) I was very disappointed with the room. It had not been renovated for a very long time. (It’s possible the hotel has nicer rooms and we just got stuck with an unrenovated room). I’ve stayed in a Best Western with a nicer bathroom before. (2) Also, this is a huge hotel that caters to conferences. We were there during the CA State Bar conference. Very crowded. (3) Parking is very expensive…but I guess you pay for the convenience. $22/day if you self-park. On the day you check-out, if you leave the garage after 2:30pm, they will charge you $6 per hour. Just was disappointed with the overall experience with this "four start" hotel

<Title>“Good - Not "Grand" Hyatt”
<Content>The views are indeed amazing at this hotel. We stayed in the Harbor Tower which I think is the older building of the two towers. While it was certainly adequate, this hotel (except for the grand lobby) was not the typical Grand Hyatt that I've previously stayed. The bathroom was not the usual quality - this had basic "three star hotel" floor tiles, no magnifying mirror, no phone in the bathroom, only the basic toiletries. The room also had an empty refrigerator, no stocked honor bar (I'd personally rather have the frig empty, I put my own soda in). As I said, certainly adequate, but not the usual 4-5-star Grand Hyatt amenities. The pool and hot tub were quite full on a Saturday, lot of kids. I'm sure the clientele changes dramatically to businessmen/conventioneers during the week. One very nice touch was an Ipod alarm clock in the room. I had a great, quiet sleep, the bed was great, amenities more than adequate, service was fine, great location, AMAZING room views - just not quite the usual quality of a Grand Hyatt.

<Content>Recently attended a conference at the Hyatt and stayed 7 nights. Great hotel, great location, great views but like other posts have mentioned, those damn train horns blasting all through the night were a real pain!!!! Why the City of San Diego doesn't have a bylaw that restricts the use of train horns during the night is beyond me!!!! The room decor was a little dated, especially the TV's which probably date back to the 1990's!!!

<Title>“BEST VIEWS IN TOWN”
<Content>Grand 4* hotel overlooking the bay and harbour. All the rooms seem to have fantastic views so don't bother with an upgrade. We were on the 24th with stunning views over the bay and harbour, looking down on the pool area. 3 in our party so they gave us 2 connecting rooms, ideal. At sunset if you are in the bar on the 40th floor with a drink they will give you a free glass of champagne - worth it just for the photo opportunity. Self-parking $22 a day, Very reasonable for San Diego. 15/20 min walk to Gaslight/shopping area or loads of rickshaws outside (agree price first). Good ambience, helpful staff, loved this hotel (and wonderful deal through Expedia).

<Title>“Twice Was More Than I Can Handle! Never Again!”
<Content>Second time staying at the Manchester which I booked through priceline. The room I was first taken to on the first visit had huge black stains on the carpet, the drapes are ripped and torn and the room smelled. I was moved to a new room which all they have are double beds in almost all rooms, they look like twin beds. The service is slow, the hallway temparture is about 50 degrees, why they pay so much to refrigerate the hallway instead of upgrading their low end worn and outdated furniture? The pool is understaffed and takes so long to even get a drink. I do not blame the staff, it is management that understaffs and does not want to have a hotel that matches the location and star rating. Second visit my credit card was over used for what reason?? Management does not care, oh well! Again I enjoyed the twin beds, no larger beds available. Again the sheer curtains were damaged and torn the outer curtains were off and hanging loose, the mirrors had hand prints, the tub filled with long black hair! Digusting! Even at the Priceline price I paid, i felt I overpaid to stay at this hotel, I they can offer is a view! I will not bid in San Diego downtown again to avoid this hotel! I waited 45 minutes for a bellman, finally carried my own bags, Horrible service, horrible attitiude and definitely a hotel to avoid at all cost! A great hotel is the Omni, far nicer and that is where I will be staying the next time!!!

<Title>“Great Location, Fabulous Views, Overall Excellent.”
<Content>I was skeptical after reading several other of the reviews for this Hotel, but have since come to the conclusion that those people will never be satisfied. I came here to celebrate an anniversary, and found it to be an excellent place to stay! Plan on spending some bucks on parking and drinks, but that comes along with staying anywhere nice. We requested a "high floor room with a bay view" when we reserved through the hotel staff, and got just that. The view is wonderful from a room on the 35th floor. And those beds are too comforatable to get out of. The room service is prompt, I couldnt find the remote control in the room and the staff ran one right up to me at 11 PM. The Hyatt Top Bar is awesome if you show up before 4 PM, meaning you actually have a chance at a table next to a window. Order stuff directly from the Bar, that place gets too busy to place an order with the wait staff. I waited about 20 minutes for a beer, while my boyfriend got his drinks right away by going to the bar. The hotel is walking distance to sea port village (even in high heels!) and the Pier Cafe is great! I would recommend this hotel, but would definately say you get your money's worth if you request a bay view room on a high floor.

<Title>“Don't stay here!”
<Content>We just came back from a 4 night stay at what I expected to be a bit more of a grand hotel. Yes the lobby is impressive and it is a good location, but there are some problems. I would have thought that this hotel would be much more sound proof than a cheap 2 or 3 star hotel...not true!!! Our neighbours came home every night at 3am and stayed up until 5am so I had no sleep between these times...at all despite two calls to security and a front desk visit. I also did not appreciate the smell of pot coming from their room to mine every time I walked in. I asked to be moved, but was told only to keep calling security. The mirrored closet door had to be fixed on arrival and they never did do anything about the tap in the shower that I could not turn off all the way without a man's assistance. Also, we had a surprise visitor in our room...a cockroach in the nightstand! AND TO TOP IT OFF, WE FOUND BED BUG BITES WHEN WE GOT HOME!!! The pool area is nice, but for a 1600 room place, they need a much bigger pool or an additional adults only pool. Cheap hotels provide free wireless internet, but not the Hyatt which was disappointing too. Upon check out we made our final complaint (before we knew about the bed bugs) and the gentleman at the desk was sympathetic and will provide a bit of a comp but I still would have preferred my sleep and a clean bed!!!!!

<Title>“DON'T STAY HERE”
<Content>Worst experience. I paid $205 a nite for the deluxe king corner room. Trash all over the place when I checked in. I asked to be moved to another deluxe king corner room which was available but they wanted to downgrade me to the standard room. The occupancy rate was only 38% that nite. The managers were rude. Save yourself some trouble and stay at the Marriott San Diego Marina instead which is rignt next door to the Hyatt. The staff at the Marriott is super nice and the view of the bay is a lot better than the Hyatt. I have to admit though, the housekeepers at the Hyatt were really nice and greeted me with a smile when they saw me in the hallway. I think they are just overworked and underpaid by the Hyatt.

<Title>“We have just the room for you...In a nightclub!!”
<Content>We traveled with our two young children for a San Diego vacation. We asked upon check-in for a quiet room as our children go to bed early. We were told by the staff they have "just the room for us". Turns out it was on the 18th floor above the hotel's nightclub! Yes, the hotel turns the outdoor pool/spa area into a nightclub on Friday and Saturday nights with blaring music from 9pm to 2am! Not only could you hear the obscene music with profane language that I wouldn't ever let my child listen to by choice, you could actually feel the music through the vibrations of the windows. I have no problem with the usual annoances of hotel stays such as elevator noise, ice machines, slamming doors, etc, but a nightclub next to paying hotel guests is absolutely unacceptable. These rooms either need to be updated with significant sound proofing glass and insulation ,or the rooms should be reserved for guests who would choose to stay in a nightclub. They should not be dubviously passed to unsuspecting guests.

<Content>Beautiful hotel with some serious gaps in service. Check in took forever. The Gold Passport dedicated line was nearly as slow as the main check in area. Elevators were extremely slow. Parking garage was a nightmare - crammed with cars, tiny parking spaces, slow garage elevators. Main breakfast restaurant was not able to handle the large Labor Day crowd - waited in line for 25-30 minutes just to get a table. Once in the dining room there were lots of empty tables. Made me think they were understaffed. Room was "ok". Towels in bathroom were in serious need of replacement. Toilet malfunctioned multiple times. "Top of the Hyatt" bar had amazing views. Too bad the windows were dirty and full of smudge marks. It was a disappointing stay. Hyatt can do better.

<Content>Don't go to this location. We landed there too quickly, fleeing from the smoke in Southern CA during the Station Fire. It's a convention hotel with a huge impressive lobby to support that business. Otherwise, stay away. We checked out 2 days early and staff agreed, after a discussion, not to penalize us by charging for one extra night's stay because we left early.

<Title>“Great Experience - not all bad as recent reveiws”
<Content>I had met a group of friend visiting in town for the St. Louis v. Padres series. They opted for the Hyatt. The location was great downtown right by the Convention Center and next to the Marriott. We are single guys and they said they can have the option to have a view of Coronado and the water and warned us about noise from the Night Club. It was a good deal for us, since we would be out til 2 a.m. anyways. Nice lobby and had a nice greeting upon arrival. Yes there is noise from the Night Club if you are on that side but just tell them if you want otherwise. Our hotel room was clean, comfortable, and enjoyed our stay. Parking downtown can be expensive - I did not like paying as much there but it is part of the deal. It worked for us, we don't order room service and just used it as a place to shower, and get some sleep in the later hours. The reviews how outline some of the pitfalls and not all I think were just, but are helpful.

<Title>“Not a good night's sleep...”
<Content>We have stayed at this Hyatt at least 5-6 times in the past and each time we stayed we noticed the customer service is just dwindling down. Staff used to be super friendly but lately, most are rude and unfriendly. I'm mainly talking about the front desk. The food service has always been great. As the previous reviewer mentioned... What was the Hyatt Manchester thinking by putting a club in the hotel with blaring, thumping, annoying music all the way until 2am? We have always stayed the opposite tower but just this weekend, we had the misfortune of staying at the side where they have the Kin Spa Club. We were up on the 18th floor and we can still hear the music. We called the front desk to let them know that it is very difficult to sleep with the loud noise from the club and they told me that they would ask the club to turn down the music. They didn’t, the music sounded even louder after our complaint. Someone from front desk told me no one else is complaining about the music except us. I find that hard to believe that people who pay good money to stay at a hotel (nice or not) would tolerate loud music all the way until 2am. He did compensate us by cutting our bill in half, but even with that I don’t I should have paid for anything at all. If it wasn’t so late, I would have looked for another hotel, at least maybe we would have gotten a good night’s rest. We ended up waking up extremely tired and because we were so tired, we ended up not going to Legoland as we promised our poor 4 year old son. We were just too tired to walk around in an amusement park after an awful night stay at the Hyatt Manchester. Our weekend was ruined thanks to the Hyatt Manchester.

<Title>“Decent, but it can be better”
<Content>We paid $170 per night for 2 nights. Its by the beach, its a huge hotel with all the ammenities, you can walk to the Seaport Village and its conveniently located. There's really not much to be said, the brand speaks for itself. One thing we did like was that it had a huge bar with pool tables and a cigar lounge. The room was very mediocre but with a great view. One thing though, it SMELLED, dingy/moldy smell. It was bearable but we definitely didn't feel comfortable at times. It looked like the hotel was in great condition but the rooms maybe can be renovated. I would stay there again for the location and if I can get it for under $150/night.

<Title>“Not even 3 stars if you ask me”
<Content>I travel almost 100% for work, and I'm highly dissapointed in the Manchester Hyatt. I have stayed in nicer LaQuinta's than this place. I had to move rooms twice, once for a tirty tub and the second time for faulty electrical and cigarette smelling room. The staff was very accomodating but I can't believe they rate this a 4 or five star hotel It's very concervative in apearance and needs updating to todays standards. It's also more than a few blocks away from the resturants.

<Title>“Rude awakening & Dirty Panties - Not 5 star in my opinion”
<Content>I stayed this weekend at the Manchester Grand Hyatt in downtown san diego and was APPALLED with my stay. We chose downtown dueto a Wedding we were attending in San Diego. My wife booked this room and was excited to stay at the New Hotel. Sunday Morning our phone started ringing 7am, when I finally answered it at 8am it was Security. He introduced himself and said he needed access to the room because a past guest left some shampoo and items in the room. My 1st response we " Are you kidding me?" We got in from the wedding maybe 3am and to get calls from security at this early of an hour is UNREAL. Furthermore the fact they would call the room vs calling housekeeping to see if the maids had found anything was astounding. AFter our RUDE awakening we found that the past Guest did in fact leave her Dirty Underwear and Panties in our room, which makes me question the cleanliness of our room upon checkin. When I checked out the clerk at the desk said they would make sure the GM called me to chat about our stay. I never received the phone call today as promised. In closing I'm super disappointed with the hotel's Security for phoning a guest so early in the morning, thus ruining our weekend away from the kids...we should have brough the kids because we did not get any extra sleep staying at your hotel dueto this unapologetic security person calling us at 7-8am on a Sunday. Secondly housekeeping is a MUST in hotels dueto the multiple guests. I do not know who the past guest was, but I sure as hell do not want to see her old dirty panties and bras in my drawers at my room after we were told we had a clean room. Was it clean? were the linens changed? I question it all now. Upon our checkout the clerk offered to pay our parking of $22. I appreciate that but expect this nights stay to be credited to my Credit Card. Dirty rooms and unsolicited phone calls possibly could be expected at a motorlodge in Chula Vista....Not The Manchester Grand Hyatt in downtown San Diego. ROOM 504 (Aug 22nd)

<Title>“Maybe more for the Business Traveler”
<Content>Hotwire found us a $99 rate for this hotel for a weekend in July. Needed a hotel for sleeping only and maybe this place was a bit much. They do cater to families here with two pools and a very large and fun filled children's play area. This is a downtown hotel and parking is $22 to self park, something to keep in mind when booking the room. Valet is a few dollars more. The Padres are about a 15 minute walk, or the trolley which is right across the street takes you right to the park. I found the room to be a little small but adequate .. the elevators, once arrived were very fast. Everyone on the staff was excellent .. The Hyatt definitly hires the right people.

<Title>“Wonderful hotel made affordable through Priceline.”
<Content>A magnificently beautiful hotel, inside and out. We were lucky to end up staying here as I put in for a 4-Star hotel in the Gaslamp area of San Diego, CA. On our arrival, the staff member was very polite and professional, but personable also. Politeness and courtesy on my part was gifted with a nice upgrade on her part, and she didn't do it for the tip I gave her after. We didn't go to any restaurants on site as we chose to dine elsewhere. Our reason for going to SD was to see 'Wicked' and the hotel was close to everything downtown, without being downtown if that makes sense. Stayed on the 26th floor with a bay-view (NICE). We heard a couple of toots of the trolley/train in the evening, but it didn't bother us and didn't hear it at night. We had a birds-eye view of the weekend fireworks in the middle of the bay around 9pm. Parking was a little higher priced (for me) at $22/night, but it's unlimited in-and-out access and we had no trouble whatever finding a spot for our Tahoe close to the elevators. Parking spaces were a smidge tight, and I wouldn't have had room for a Mega-cab, or lifted truck because of the height restriction (check with hotel), and tight corners in garage.

<Title>“Luxury and Top Notch Service”
<Content>We stayed on the 26th floor with a view of the harbor. The view was incredible and the room was top notch. New bed, great linens, and nice furniture. The windows open a small amount to enjoy the ocean breeze. This hotel also has a full gym with free weights and the most advanced treadmills, climbers, etc. There is a $5 fee but it is a real gym with a view! Pool area is small but accommodating. 1 Sport court with 2 tennis courts that are well maintained and free to use. Close to Gaslamp, airport, and freeway access. Only annoying part is fees for internet, and $22 for self park. Will return for another fantastic stay.

<Title>“Great Lobby, Ok rooms, Great Desk Clerk, service needs to step it up!”
<Content>Stayed 1 night at the Manchester Grand, 8/8/09, pricelined it a week before for $100, so at half off maybe I shouldnt complain. Great Lobby, really looks like a vegas hotel, very classy, and expansive. Exceptional service from Victor at the front desk. $32 for valet, $13 for internet, no wireless in the rooms, had to threaten to walk out of the steak restaurant to get served, overpriced underserved drinks at the KIN lounge , looked over by the taxi stand attendant, and so on. I really wanted to like it, because the room had a great view and its a beautiful structure, but it felt like it was their opening week and they had to work out some kinks. Maybe we will try it again, its got to be better next time.

<Title>“fancy p-a-n-t-s”
<Content>I stayed here for 2 nights for a wedding and was really impressed. The hotel is gi-normous w/ two towers and two pools, a handful of restaurants and prime harbor location. Not to mention the airport is only about 20 min. away. We had a lot of fun in the sports bar w/ their insane Bloody Mary's. For those of you who hail from the great state of Minnesota, you will particularly enjoy their Bloody Mary accessories which include a Slim Jim and a beer back. The breakfast buffet is worthy, but their casual take away cafe is pretty crappy. The room was nice, slightly small for 2 double beds and the bathroom was upgraded. I did enjoy the nice view of the pool and harbor. The Downtown Trolley picks up across the street, but you need to know where you 're going as there is not a lot of info at the stations about lines, etc. We took it to Old Town and it was a 20 min adventure. Beware that due to the downtown location everything around the hotel is closed at night. We went to 7-11 to get booze and they stop selling at 10pm. Weird. On the other hand, the hotel has 2 bars as well as a nightclub so you can stay occupied.

<Title>“Nice location, Nice facility but OK room”
<Content>This is an excellent hotel with a grand, stunning lobby. It has excellent views of the city. The locaion is a tad bit out of downtown shopping areas. Especially with young kids, it is little bit difficult to walk. But it has excellent facilities. The only thing room is little bit outdated for a FOUR star hotel. Old bed linen and old towels and a pretty ordinary bathroom. Another thing with the San Diego area is that most of the hotels have only 2 double BEDs instead of standard 2 queens. They have a small Cafe on ground floor with starbucks coffee with regular prices. So it is really convenient. Over all I am satisfied and would stay again. Also please note that there is a parking fees in most down town hotels and there is no exception here with $22/night self parking.

<Title>“Convenient location, helpful staff, Grand Club was a plus”
<Content>I've stayed in numerous hotels by the convention center, during one of SD's busiest times of the year (Comic Con). This was my 1st time at the Hyatt. Pros: Front desk staff - early check-in, no problem. Very helpful staff (Lauren?) ... she combined my 2 diff reservations into one (so I didn't have to move rooms!). Grand Club - continental breakfast was better than I imagined. Besides the assortment of bagels/muffins/toast you'd expect, there was an assortment of fresh berries (yum!), melons and cheeses. Evening appetizers were equally delicious and non-standard fare. We were never in the hotel during the day, but I think there were snacks/sodas offered all afternoon. Definitely worth the extra $ for Grand Club, esp. when traveling with 3 hungry kids (ages 11-14). Location - walking distance to everything: convention center, downtown/Gaslamp, harbor, bank & grocery store. Pool area - included two jacuzzis and fire pit overlooking the harbor. Cons: Rooms - we were in the South? (closest to conv center) tower. The rooms are small, but clean. They are definitely in need of renovation. Countertops/fixtures were really old (like a 2 star hotel). The lack of a bathroom fan probably contributed to the carpet outside being a bit soggy (had to leave the door open to vent) our entire stay. It seemed impossible to get 4 towels (even aft calling) each day or replenishment of bathroom supplies. There's a club outside by the pool (diff than the main pool) playing loud music until 2am. It wasn't terrible, but then again we were high up (30 flr). Internet fee - they must be one of the few hotels that still charge ($12.95) per day. Overall, would stay here again, maybe trying the north tower..

<Content>This is a great location to everything. Just pricey though you pay for extra view and parking $22 a day.. I'm not sure why when you go to California you get charged to pay for parking when you are already paying a high price for the hotel. The room wasn't that exciting but it was within walking distance to USS Midway, Seaport Village and the Gaslamp District.

<Title>“Exceeded expectations!”
<Content>My girlfriend and I were very impressed with this hotel. The lobby is beautiful, the staff was very friendly and helpful, and the room very clean and well kept. The location for tourists is outstanding; Seaport Village is right out the back door of the hotel, Coronado is a 5 minute drive, Sea World a 10 minute drive, other beaches such as Ocean Beach 15 minutes by car. The 4th floor pool area is outstanding as well with a beautiful view of the bay and Coronado. Make sure to check out the "Top of the Hyatt" also, located on the 40th floor with magnificent views of San Diego (albeit with high priced beverages!). We also enjoyed the breakfast buffet with its delicious fresh items and wonderful service in an elegant setting. The train did not bother us at all, and we had a room on the 22nd floor facing the tracks. The ability to crack open a window in the room was much appreicated as well, letting in the fresh bay air. Some commenters have stated that the hotel needs an update; I could not disagree more. The Manchester seemed to be in great shape to us. My only minor quibbles would be the following: the TV's need to be updated in the rooms (no flat panels), the self parking charge of $22 per night is ridiculous (though not uncommon in San Diego unfortunately), and we had to eventually leave! Definitely recommend!

<Title>“Excellent hotel, but parking is pricey”
<Content>The Grand Hyatt in San Diego is an excellent hotel. We stayed there for 4 nights in July for Comic Con in a Water View King room. The view was fantastic, and we even saw a fireworks show over the bay as an extra treat! Other reviewers may think the decor needs updating, but our room felt up-to-date. The bed was very comfortable; the only drawback being that they didn't use a fitted sheet, and the bottom sheet kept riding up during the night. However, this is typical of most hotels. The housekeeping service was excellent - they even replaced the soap in the shower every day. Towels were pretty soft, too, which was a nice change from most hotels. Water pressure was very high - and we were on the 36th floor. As we were next to the stairway, anytime someone used the stairs, it was very loud, and shook the room. However this only happened once a day. Elevators were very fast, so I guess most people weren't interested in using the stairs. The parking services were very nice to us when the self-parking was full, and gave us valet parking at self-parking prices. Even so, it was $22 per day for self-parking, and $32 for valet parking. Internet services were reasonably priced at $12 per day for "business internet service" which didn't have a bandwidth cap like the "basic internet services." It was still a little slow, but about average for hotel internet service. The location is excellent; you can walk to the convention center, and the boardwalk and Seaport Village are right outside the door. Overall an excellent stay, and I hope to come back again next year.

<Title>“Close to Convention Center, Rooms need updating”
<Content>I agree with my fellow reviewers that the outside and lobby are deceiving, since they give the impression that the hotel is luxurious. The lobby is luxurious but the rooms are in pretty dire need of a makeover. The rooms have old TVs with tired remotes, popcorn ceilings, tired furniture and bathroom fixtures. However, our view was very nice. Since we were only staying over the weekend and my husband was attending Comic-Con, it was perfect for the location. One standout point about this hotel is that the staff were all superb. We ordered room service and the food was delivered at the time stated, still hot, and was reviewed for accuracy prior to the employee leaving the room. Every hotel employee we encountered was very courteous and went out of their way to insure that we were having a pleasant stay. I would stay here again but only if the rate was more in line with the standard of room offered. I thought the room rate and extra costs (i.e. $22/day to self-park, $12.95/day for WiFi) were overpriced.

<Title>“Love the Hyatt.....Not the parking”
<Content>We checked in on a Friday afternoon and arrived early. The hotel had been booked the night before, so they were unable to accomodate our early arrival. They did, however, take our phone number and promised to call when our room was ready. After a 2 hour wait, but still before standard check in time our room was ready. The room itself had a georgous view. There were a couple of stains on the carpet, but other than that the room was awesome. (It was a little annoying to hear the trains in the middle of the night) Everything else was perfect about this hotel with the exception on the parking. I agree with others comments about how expensive it is. $22/day plus the taxes really add a lot to your hotel bill. The Hyatt does offer wonderful service. I love how everyone seems to know your name and does whatever they can to make your stay comfortable. I will definately stay at the Hyatt again. I love that Seaport Village is right outside and that so much is within walking disance. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Best hotel experience I've ever had!”
<Content>We checked in on a Sunday and the check-in process was easy. The bellmen were smiling and helpful. Our double bed room was a bit small, but the view was wonderful. My two sons, ages 21 and 15, did not sleep well on the double bed, so the next morning I went down to the front desk to ask for a rollaway. Turns out they cannot put a rollaway in the rooms with two double beds (fire code). The clerk (TINA) looked at how long we were staying, and asked me to wait a moment. She returned and told me they were going to move us to a larger room, big enough for two rollaways. The bellman helped us move, and it turns out this was a HUGE room with a kitchen and a dining table! There was a Murphy bed for me, and two rollaways for the boys, a sofa, a dvd player, and two large windows looking out over the bay. I was dumbfounded. The rollaways were extremely comfortable, not like any rollaways I have ever seen. We all slept soundly every night we were there. The most incredible thing happened the next afternoon - I went down to the coffee shop for an afternoon caffeine fix. I inadvertantly left my room key AND my credit card on the counter, in the little sleeve they give you at check in. I panicked and went down to check if it was still there. Of course, it wasn't. I went to the Bell Desk, shaking like a leaf. They called security, and as I was giving my report, one of the bellmen (Joel), said he was going down to the coffee shop to check one more time. Less than five minutes later, he returned with my room key and my credit card! He had DUG THROUGH THE TWO TRASHCANS and found them! This was the most incredible example of going ABOVE AND BEYOND I have ever experienced. I used the comment card to rave about Tina the front desk clerk and of course about Joel, who saved our vacation - literally.

<Title>“Mostly hits but some misses”
<Content>You know the hotel I'm talking about; the significant flat edged screwdriver like structures that grace the San Diego skyline belong to the Manchester Grand Hyatt and well for all its grandeur, my expectations were a bit higher than what had been met. Our family stay at the Hyatt was above all pleasant but surely had some hits and misses. As an architectural landmark it's breathtaking and definitely worthy of the word grand from it's strong wood arches and marbled lobbied floors, the Hyatt on the outside is pleasing to the eye. Its pool is reminiscent of a Las Vegas hotel pool, one of the larger ones in the downtown San Diego hotel district and ample room for everyone to lay out and enjoy the gorgeous weather. The breakfast buffet at Lael's is abundant (omelet station, lox and bagels and delicious coffee) and service is outstanding. The Hyatt also incorporates a lot of complimentary family friendly activities such as a swim-up movie at nightfall, for a small fee you and your fam can enjoy s'mores by the fire pit and an all day activity area for lawn bowling, football and foosball. Am I enticing you yet? Better hold off on the thought because granted its pros there's surely some cons that may be of importance to some of you out there. One of them is the room. The rooms at the Manchester GRAND Hyatt are pretty much your average (insert your 3 star and below hotel here) type rooms. What a disappointment when you've been sold on everything else. And secondly the parking is horrendously expensive and certainly not enough for both hotel structures guests plus those visiting Top of the Hyatt. They also ended up overcharging my account for parking, yikes! Nice try Hyatt, but you still got some work to do.

<Title>“A Magical Stay at the Manchester”
<Content>After reading some of the TA reviews I was hesitant to book this hotel. I called the hotel directly to ask questions about the noise level and the pool closure situation mentioned in another review. The manager assured me that our family would have a great room. She was not wrong! Our family received exceptional hospitality at the Manchester Grand Hyatt. The lobby is fantastic and looks just like the pictures on the Internet. Our welcome at check in was very friendly and accommodating. I explained to him that one of our girls had thrown up in the car on our way from Disneyland and asked to have a roll-a-way bed. He said that we probably didn't need it, but if I wanted one he was happy to send one up. I guess I had a puzzled look so he proceeded to say that we were in an 1,100 sq. ft. suite. I booked a regular room. We walked in the double doors to our room to find a huge hotel room complete with 2 sitting rooms with 3 couches, a dining room with seating for 8, an office, a kitchenette with an apartment size refrigerator, 2 bathrooms, a separate king bedroom and a full size Murphy bed in one of the sitting rooms. We were pleasantly surprised stay in a hotel suite that was equivalent to 5 rooms. The hotel went above and beyond to make our stay fantastic! It was a wonderful treat to be upgraded to a suite. The kitchenette counter was full of goodies for us and the girls when we checked in. My girls thought they were living "The Suite Life of Zack & Cody". They loved it! The management at the Hyatt made our stay truly magical. We know that our stay was exceptional, but we still will highly recommend this hotel to our family and friends. The room was perfect for our family and would be great for a large family or a business traveler on an extended stay. Some details to note: 1. This is definitely a convention hotel . It is the 2nd largest Hyatt in the world with over 1,600 rooms. This is probably why you find the Manchester on Hotwire and Priceline. Parking was convenient and easy to find a space. The rate was $22 per day for self parking. I know some people complain that this is high, but parking in a big city is to be expected. 2. The location is fantastic! It is walking distance to the Gaslamp District, the Convention Center, the Seaport and more. The views are spectacular. I've attached some pictures that I took from the hotel. 3. We did not try the hotel restaurants. They seemed busy and the food smelled great! There was a barista preparing coffee drinks to order in the morning. Coffee drinkers will love it! We purchased groceries at the nearby Ralph's Grocery store for breakfast items since we had a refrigerator. 4. The outdoor pool was beautiful. It was heated, but too chilly for me. My husband and kids swam, but I preferred the hot tub. There were 2 of them on either side of the pool deck. Both with great views of the harbor. I've attached some pictures. There is another pool in the spa area that is converted to a night club in the evenings during the summer months. We could hear the music when we were outside on the regular pool deck. There were a lot of young professionals staying at the hotel. The poolside bar was bustling with activity and people of all ages were seen throughout the hotel property. It seemed like a place to be seen in the evening. 5. Our room was very large and appointed well. The king bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. They seemed to be down with a down duvet, but I can't be sure now. The king bedroom was handicap accessible in the bathroom. There were handles and a seat in the shower and handles near the toilet. There was a full length mirror in the bathroom for guests who could not see in the mirror over the sink. The lighting in this bathroom was not great. It would be difficult to put make up on with the dim florescent lighting. The countertops were marble with tile flooring. The curtains in this bedroom were remote control. I'm not sure if this was because it was a suite or if it was a handicap feature, but they were very cool and worked well. 6. In the foyer, there was another bathroom. This one was quite grand with 2 separate sinks on opposite walls, a toilet and a shower/tub. The countertops were green marble and the marble/tile accents on the floor and walls were cream and yellow. The lighting was excellent and included recessed lighting in the shower. 7. The furniture in the sitting rooms, dining room and office were dark green and golden yellow. It was a classic style. The furnishings were older, but well taken care of and in good condition. There were lots of accessories to make it seem like a professionally decorated room. As I said before, my kids thought it was super luxurious and they were in heaven! 8. This might not seem unusual to those who travel out west, but we were surprised that the windows opened. In the South it is too hot and humid to open the windows. It was nice to feel the great cool air and to hear the sounds on the street. We could hear the clippity-clop of horse drawn carriages and the sound of the trolley. I found it charming. I know others find the train loud and annoying. I guess it depends on your room location. We were on the 6th floor of the Seaport Tower with a view of the Navy ship. If you are a light sleeper you might want to ask to be in a room that does not face the train tracks. We were not bothered at all, but I did talk with other guests who were. Overall this was a great first visit to San Diego. We saw the San Diego Zoo, the San Diego Wild Animal Park and SeaWorld. It was nice to have a comfortable hotel room to stay in after very busy days seeing the sights. We would definitely stay at the Manchester Grand Hyatt again.

<Title>“The Perfect Place to Stay”
<Content>Did exhaustive research of all downtown hotels. Selected the Hyatt for last weekend's stay and couldn't be happier. The location was super. Knew it was "close" to Sea Port village but did not realize that meant you walk out the back door and you're in this mini-village w/ great shops, restaurants, street performers. Quick boat trip within a 2 minute walk and you're in Coronodo(highly recommend). Room was great and staff were very accomodating. We arrived early so our room was not ready but we were able to go to the pool and the staff phoned us when we could ck in. The evening fire w/ marshmallows was a big hit with my 10 year old. Very convenient location.

<Title>“Fantastic, great location, great staff.”
<Content>We (wife, 2 boys 13 and 11) checked in on June27th and the entire process took less then 3 minutes. The room was on the 27th floor overlooking the USS Midway and the view was great. The pool area and sports deck were an immediate hit with my boys and I noticed they also had a kids club for the younger ones where they were decorating cookies pool side. Later that night they showed a movie in one of the conference rooms and had a pop corn machine, but this seemed to be catered more to the little ones. The parking, as everyone else has mentioned, ran $22 a day for self parking and $32 for valet. The self parking garage is attached to the hotel and access in and out was a breeze. Petco Park is a nice stroll past the Convention Center (less then a mile) from the hotel and is an extremely safe walk at night, just mind the pedi-cabs as there are plenty of those and if you don't pay attention you may meet one unexpectedly. If you are going to the game, check to see if the Hotel is running there All-Star Deal, where if there are any home runs hit during the game you can receive discounts on your stay. Behind the hotel near the water is a great little shopping area where you can get pretty inexpensive food and drinks. If you need any incidentals, about a mile from the hotel is a grocery store called Ralph's which carries anything you may need, just ask the desk for directions. I took the walk myself at night, and although it seemed pretty safe and the area is very clean, there were your share of homeless in the area, (not a lot, but enough to notice) but not one of them bothered me. Still, the walk was pleasant. La Jolla was only 15 minutes away with some great kayaking, The San Diego Zoo (fantastic/all day event) was about the same, and Mission Beach had a great boardwalk with rides and games. We ate one night at the Corvette diner, look it up and also hughly recommended. Kids loved it. I did manage to leave several items in my hotel room at checkout (ah, the pleasure of travelling with kids, but I am in the process of getting them back with the hotels assistance) . The only downside was not having free internet in your room. If I can get it in much lesser hotels for free, hide it in the price of the room for me so I feel like I'm getting something. Other then that, there isn't anything bad I could say about this hotel, I highly recommend it and would definately stay here again.

<Title>“Great location, but better hotels.”
<Content>I live in SD and just went for a weekend getaway. I got an excellent deal through priceline ($107 per night). It was quite crowded due to all of the conventions going on, but they have a special check-in line for Gold Passport members...so make sure you sign up on line beforehand (it's free); if not, you may be standing in line a while just to get your room key. The hotel is in one of the cleanest and nicest parts of downtown, and if you get a harbor view room, you won't be disappointed. I was on the 23rd floor and had an amazing view of much of San Diego. The room was decent (paying more for location and view than room ameneties). No mini-bar, which was disappointing and the first time I have seen such a thing in SD. The 4th floor pool was decent...service was very slow (only 2 servers for the entire deck), so it took about 10 minutes to get anything we ordered. The lounge chairs were dirty, so grab two towels so you don't have to touch them. But, it is better than the 3rd deck pool...which makes a very bad attempt at being a hip, trendy, rooftop club/pool/bar (leave it to the Ivy and the Hard Rock and just be a Hyatt!!). They even play club music during the day, which can be quite annoying. Bad service at that pool also. I ordered room service at 11:00 p.m. and was told it would take 45 minutes...it didn't arrive until 12:15. A little annoying, but the food was some of the best I have had through room service (although quite pricey), so I couldn't complain. Overall, if you can get a deal, this is a great location...you are in the middle of anything you could ever want to do in downtown SD.

<Title>“Couldn't sleep a wink, the service was the worst and it cost an arm and a leg.”
<Content>I stayed there during the SIGGRAPH convention in 2007, their Wi-fi was the worst I have experienced. This is a computer based conference so this was unacceptable. When checking in there was a mess up with my room so I had to come later that night to get my room. I usually sleep like the dead but because the hotel is located between the bay and a trolley stop, surrounding noise kept me up all night for 5 nights NO EXAGGERATION. There should have been double layered glass (at least) to keep out the noise. The convention I paid a lot of money (airfare and fees $4000) to see flying from Japan was worthless because of my sleepless week in San Diego's worst hotel. When I checked out they could not put the weeks stay on any mileage that they initially said could be. I had not ordered a mini-bar (which was locked anyway) but they tried to charge me for it. I filled out a complaint card leaning my contact info, but never got any response. In fact I now refuse to stay in any Hyatt because of this painful experience. I checked out and went to a cheaper quieter place nearby.

<Title>“Definitely a convention hotel”
<Content>Yet another glitzy marbleized convention hotel. They all look the same after a while. This hotel is just a block or two from the convention center and it was filled with conventioneers. Not a complaint, just a statement of fact. We were attending a company conference at the hotel which meant that the company paid for our room. Still, we had to pay an extra $25 per night to get a king-sized bed. Our room was very clean but starting to show the wear and tear. There was no turn-down service and wet towels are replaced only once a day--though one of the three evenings we did get wet towels replaced in the afternoon as well as the morning --but don't depend on it. It also meant that we got to sample the catering department food rather than the hotel restaurants. The two dinners we had --one buffet and the other sit-down --were both very good. The company convention planners are very good at what they do and make very good choices when it comes to food; still they depend on the hotel for execution and in this case, the hotel gets good marks. We skipped the lunches but the food choices at breakfast were plentiful and varied. Of course, the company chooses our menu so I can only complain to them about the egg choice -- can't they just once give us an omelet bar instead of that huge chafing dish of yellow glop? Yes, I would still recommend this hotel to a friend. The location is beautiful with a great view of the bay and plenty to do in walking distance of the hotel.

<Title>“Going down in value and service, unfortunately”
<Content>I've stayed at this hotel several times over the last 10 years and although it's a beautiful property, I feel that it's slowly going down in value and service. My biggest complaint... we stayed on a Saturday night and there was a party/club like atmosphere out at the pool on the 3rd or 4th floor that went until 2 a.m. LOUD club-like music. Apparently this goes on every Saturday and is open to everyone. The front desk clerk did tell us about this in advance, but described it as a pool side cocktails type of gathering. He failed to mention the music and that it was loud and club-like. Sure, they moved us to the other tower when we called (although we could only get 2 full beds), but why-oh-why would you even have this when even 15 floors up guests can hear it so clearly? When I first started staying here 10+ years ago it was a fairly quiet (quaint like feel) hotel with 5-star service. Now, not so much. Luckily for us, we got this room for $69 + tax ($85 total) on Priceline. Otherwise if I would have paid the $199 I saw quoted everywhere else, I would have been way more disappointed. Next time, I'd rather stay elsewhere... unless Priceline puts me there.

<Title>“Love the location and the price from priceline!”
<Content>This was the second time I was fortunate enough to get a great price from Priceline for this hotel. I asked for a "quiet" room and was given a room in the Seaport Tower Rm #1565 and it was a great room. With the A/C fan turned on automatic it was fine. No noise from the pool area at night but you could hear a bit of the trains. The room was great--typical business but clean. There was a nice ipod radio, safe big enough for 2 laptops, a small refrigerator, desk, easy chair, standard TV. The king size bed was reasonably comfortable. Yes, parking is $22 a night but for the price I got the hotel for the parking was no big deal. The best thing about it all is the very great location..it was so wonderful to walk to dinner, walk along the water before dinner, go to bed, get up and take a long walk on the harborfront, have breakfast, take another walk....just gorgeous. And yes, it is an easy walk to the Gaslamp District and all the excitement happening there...but this location was so much better. Not sure how it compares to the other hotels in the immediate area, but if you can a good price it is a fabulous place to stay.

<Title>“GREAT HOTEL AND LOCATION BUT EXTREMELY NOISEY!”
<Content>This is a very nice hotel conveniently located with beautiful views. Our room was comfortable and had a great view of Coranado Bridge and the water. The seaport village is right out the back door and has a promenade along the water with several restaurants and shops, very nice. The gaslamp district is within walking distance or you can take a pedicab. The trolley is stops across the street and is fun and efficient. OK now for the downside...Our room was on the 14th floor and we could see the SPA pool area ...not a good location. Friday and Saturday night the SPA turns into an outdoor club with earsplitting techno music (with ear plugs I was able to sleep). As if that wasn't bad enough we returned to our room Sunday afternoon with the hopes of taking a nap before dinner...not a chance...the SPA again was party central, BLASTING TECHNO bass and a sea of bikini clad humanity. The front desk informed me it would not end until 8:30 pm. The 4th floor pool closed early on Saturday afternoon for a private function and from other reviews I have read that also turns into a loud party atmosphere. I just think it would not be that hard for the hotel to lower the decibel level of the music to spare their guests any discomfort I loved my stay in San Diego but if you stay at the Hyatt DEMAND a quiet room!

<Title>“great location,poor management”
<Content>We stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt may 6-9th for a medical conference.. The location is great,right next to the harbor and convention centers. We were in room 1535 right above the pool. What they don't tell you is that in the summer they rent out the pool area for weddings,proms and private parties on fri and sat nights. Unfortunately for us it was prom nite.. The noise was very loud!! We called and complained at 11:30pm but were told it would continue untill 1:45am,But they would give us a different room or give us half off for the nite.We took the half off and next day checked in to the Omni. How could they possible rent those rooms out, knowing their clients would not be able to sleep? We won't be back....by the way the Omni was great, I guess thats why they are rated number 5 in San Diego and the Manchester is 55.

<Title>“Great hotel, but rooms could be updated”
<Content>Overall was pleased with the hotel- great views, great location, elegant decor, great pools. I was recently there for a conference, and had a bayview room with a king bed booked. At check-in, they insisted I would have to pay more for a bayview, even though the reservation I had (and had printed out) was for a bayview room. Finally with some argument, they gave me the room I reserved. The room was well-appointed and a very nice bed, but the TV was very old (no flat-panel) and at times needed to be hit to get it to work. My only real complaint with the room was the bathroom- it had poor fluorescent lighting (and no shave mirror, which made shaving very difficult in the low light), and no vent fan. The bathroom appeared more consistent with a downscale hotel, or one from about 20 years ago. Lastly, the fitness center costs $5/day, which I feel should be complimentary, as in most other hotels.

<Title>“Awesome location”
<Content>Spent 5 days at this hotel on May 2009 while attending a conference at San Diego Convention Center, which happens to be only a couple of blocks down the road. Needless to say, the location of this hotel is perfect-- it's right on the harbor: the ground floor is practically SeaPort Village/Embarcadero Park. Cant say anything about the prices because my accommodations were paid for by the conference organizers... but what I didn't appreciate was how they nickel-and-dimed for everything: parking ($22/night to self park, more if valet), internet ($10/night for ecnomy, $45/night for business), gym ($25). Fortunately my parking fees were also covered by the conference organizers. And I circumvented the gym fee by signing up for a "Gold Card" (sign up online for free and members get in gym as part of priviledges). The front desk staff were not the friendliest I've met. But they did their job so I guess they're alright. The rooms were beautiful. our room was on the 28th floor, and I can't say enough about the cleaning staff up there. They wouldn't even take a tip for a job well done. The view was spectacular, especially with the Red Bull Air Race going on that weekend. The beds were comfy. The bathrooms were sparkling. Closet space was huge.Room in itself was spacious (hubby got to bring n his 2 mountain bikes inside room with room to spare). The pool area was nice, went there a couple of times to use the hottub, and once to play pingpong with hubby. The gym was awesome (I couldn't believe their treadmills-- it's monitor each had a tv, an iPod docking stating and a USB connection among other things-- definitely top of the line equipment-- clean and well maintained). Just remember the code word: "Gold Club Member" :) Had dinner there during a catered event on Cinco de Mayo, the food was ok. The bartenders made killer margaritas... The verdict: Would love to stay again-- for the location, for the room. Sure I hated the whole nickel and dime thing, but if I wasn't able to access the gym, there certainly are plenty of places to run around in the area to get exercise.

<Title>“Good location, good room”
<Content>Stayed at the Hyatt for a conference in early April. The hotel is very nice with clean rooms that have comfortable beds. The service was great and provided a room change that appeared to be a possible upgrade since it was a bigger room that the one originally provided. The hotel's location provides access to numerous activities in walking distance as well as a good number of restaurants and bars. The hotel provided good recommendations for dinner and for once, did not recommend a restaurant on their own property, which was refreshing. The price of the room was based upon a group rate, so can't comment too much on that either. Would stay there again.

<Title>“It is a good conference hotel!”
<Content>My room had a view of the marina, was always cleaned well, included a free in room fridge, a large enough safe to store my mac, and an ipod docking radio. The gym stayed open 24 hrs, affordable food within 5 minutes walk and my convention was in the hotel. Great reasons to stay here. The lobby made the hotel to appear more luxurious than it really was but that's a welcome treat as my room was a tad dated. I had a really good stay overall. Two tips: 1) somebody's review said the pillows are high and hard. True. Quite thankful I brought my own. 2) two choices for internet connection. The cheaper option streams like a dial up so I converted to the more expensive one but even that was not good enough for my magic jack phone. Check your usage, it may better to just go the lobby and use the free wi fi.

<Content>Stayed here at a conference. The lobby was huge, so huge you felt like you were taking a hike to get from one end to the other. The tower I stayed in had a great view of the bay, but little else to recommend it. The carpets were dingy, the hallways scratched and scruffy, the furniture mediocre. The internet cost over $10 per day. Ridiculous. The hotel gym was great but they wanted to charge for that too! Other than a great location there is NOTHING to recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Beautiful hotel! Impressive staff!”
<Content>We just returned from a weekend stay at the Manchester Hyatt and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this lovely hotel. Even though we booked a discounted rate, they gave us a room on the 16th floor overlooking the bay, the bridge to Coronado Island, and the lovely pool area below. The beds were VERY comfy, the bathroom was spacious and spotless, there was an Ipod sound dock (which our two teenaged girls loved!), and we could crack open the window to let in some fresh air. From the time we walked into the gorgeous lobby, every employee we encountered was welcoming, friendly, and helpful. They were quick to give tips on the easiest way to get to nearby Petco Park....shopping....quaint Seaport Village (adjacent to the hotel!)...etc. We normally stay near Mission Bay, but opted this time to be downtown - - since we were going to a Padres game, and I was a little concerned about the train/street noise .. but we were never bothered by it. The location was great. The hotel has a large deck area around the pool with plenty of lounge chairs, two hot tubs, and fire pits that were fun to sit around at night. If you have small children, there is an enclosed play area next to the pool where they can run amok safely! There's also basketball, tennis and volleyball hard courts available - - which we thoroughly enjoyed. And the fitness room is enormous. All in all, this was a fantastic experience. Thank you, Hyatt! :o)

All the amenities you would expect from a high-class hotel. Convenient to lovely Marina Bay and San Diego convention center. If you like to run or walk, it is very accessible to the board walk, perfect for this activity. Using AAA (Triple A), the cost of my room was quite reasonable with a delicious buffet breakfast included each morning. I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again if I go back to San Diego.

<Content>I stayed at the Hyatt 4/11-4/14 while attending a conference. It's in a great location, close to both Seaport Village and to the San Diego Conference Center. I didn't have to take a cab the whole time I was there, which was nice. The hotel staff was very helpful. I had an issue with my bill and it was resolved quickly and easily. The room was a typical large business hotel room, and the funishings were fine, though the bathroom needs an update. I had read about train noise being an issue, but I did not hear the train at all from my room. I had a nice, quiet, uneventful stay, which is exactly what I wanted.

<Title>“Mostly good”
<Content>This is my second time staying at this Hyatt location, and this time it cost half as much. Perhaps due to the economy and big discounts? The location is fabulous - right on the waterfront, walking distance to the gaslamp district and museums. The hotel is huge and the front desk & concierge staff are helpful. Concierge suggested a couple non-touristy restaurants and the one we chose was excellent. The room size was adequate with a king bed, louge chair, desk, and mini-fridge. Good mattress and linens, with extra pillows and blankets. Our room was quiet - which is a huge deal for me, I can't stand hearing the people upstairs walking around. The decor and bathroom fixtures need updating. Decor doesn't bother me, but drippy tub faucet and shower temperature variations are annoying. We let them know on the way out. For the price, I don't mind putting up with these things. All in all, it worked out well for what I wanted.

<Title>“Good Location - Excellent Views”
<Content>Spent two nights at Manchester Grand Hyatt this weekend. For a hotel of 1,100 + rooms the service was excellent. It is a convention hotel so don't expect it to be intimate and quiet. For leisure travelers the marina and seaport village are right out the back door and the Gaslamp District is just several blocks away across Harbor Drive. All the comments about the trains going by are true, they do have several per night, but big deal, it never bothered us. Did not try any of the restaurants in the hotel, they are way too many good ones in the Gaslamp. Recommend Richard Walker's Pancake house for breakfast (3 blocks away) and both Bondi and Basic farther over in the Gaslamp for dinner. Redfield's Sports bar in the hotel is a good place for all major sporting events and cold beer. The two tower are the Seaport and the Harbor. The Seaport is newer, so the rooms in the Harborside tower suffer from the 1980's style hotel furniture, older tvs, dated artwork, etc. The beds were very comfortable, we had an executive suite on the 20th floor which has a second connecting room to the bedroom that was like a parlor or sitting room. Great views of Coronado and the harbor below. Check out the Top of the Hyatt bar (in the Harbor tower) on the 40th floor for an almost 360 degree view of the surroundings. Great spot for sunset drinks. Like I indicated in the ratings above, room service, houskeeping, front desk and the bell stand/valet were all excellent. Definitely would stay again but would want to have a newer bay view corner room in the Seaport Tower.

<Title>“Outstanding”
<Content>We recently traveled to San Diego and booked with the Manchester Grand Hyatt because as a travel agent I wanted to try a downtown hotel as opposed to the hotel circle hotels that we generally stay at. They greeted us with open arms and were very accommodating. Location was awesome and withing walking distance to Seaport Village, the Harbor and downtown. By car it was close to Coronado and many shopping malls. The hotel was beautiful and quite elaborate in decor. The lobby was breathtaking and very clean. The staff went out of their way to help and everyone was very friendly. We stayed in the Seaport Tower on the 22nd floor, harbor view and our room was beautiful as was the view from our room. The bed was one of the best we have ever experienced in a hotel. Every bit as good as the Westin's "heavenly bed" and Marriotts. There is a coffee shop on the main floor open early in the morning with food which was very handy and don't miss the bar on the 40th floor or the Harbor Building. The view is extraordinary. The pool and firepits located on the 4th floor were very nice as well. The view at night is also quite breathtaking and the fire pits were a nice touch in the cool evening air. The only negative as paying an additional 22.00 per night for the parking garage, but it is San Diego and parking is always at a premium nearly everywhere you travel throughout the city. I had read a lot of negative reviews before traveling to this hotel and I am not sure exactly where all those negative people stayed, but it obviously was not anywhere near where we stayed. Maybe they have separate wing for rude and negative people and they put them alI together so they have something to complain about. I suppose that if I needed to make any negative remarks, it would be about the family in the room next to us with the crying baby that seemed to cry throughout the night and "early" in the morning. I realize families need a room when they travel, I just would have appreciated their room NOT being next to mine. The walls are fairly thin so we could hear them quite well. Aside from that issue, I would definitely send my clients and friends to the Manchester Grand Hyatt and I will most definitely stay there again.

<Title>“Not up to Hyatt's usual standard”
<Content>We got a fabulous rate on a room for a 4 day trip. The location is great, and the staff is very accommodating. But we had to wonder if we were given a substandard room due to the low rate - there was no light bulb in the bedside table lamp, the internet didn't work (although the tech person came quickly to remedy it), the accent "throw" at the bottom of the bed was hopelessly wrinkled, the bathtub had grunge on the bottom from old non-skid strips that had peeled off, and there was trash behind the cabinet holding the fridge and coffee maker. We also had delays checking in, with our room not being ready at the advertised 3 pm check-in time. Otherwise, the usual Hyatt amenities were there: the bed was fabulous and comfy and the breakfast brunch was scrumptious.

<Title>“Very nice hotel. Great amenities, location and views.”
<Content>Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego is a wonderful hotel. My wife and I stayed here while I attended a conference at the San Diego Convention centre, less than a 5 minute walk away. My wife was able to enjoy a great pool deck area, an amazing little tourist walk(Seaport Village) with lots of great options for lunch, snacks or simply a relaxing stroll along the waterfront, and an excellent view of ships, seagulls and Coronado Island from our room. Some negatives. Service was a little lacking at the hotel due to the size of the property. There are a lot of rooms, so it can seem impersonal. The rooftop bar is a perfect location to watch a sunset, but a glass of wine approaches $10. The maids charged us for simply moving some bottles in the minibar fridge to chill a bottle of champagne. Finally, you may need to worry about room location, as train tracks run by the front of the hotel, and this can be a rude morning awakening if you're at the front of the hotel (which we weren't). But, all this didn't take away from the many pluses for the hotel. Some recommendations. There are 3 or 4 great brunch restaurants in Seaport Village. It's only a 5 minute walk into Gaslamp Quarter, and there's an amazing wine selection at this grocery store called Ralph's, along with a great breakfast spot called Richard Walker's Pancake House, and some other really nice restaurants, complete with nightlife. At night, the hotel lights an outdoor fire pit, and it's a great place for an evening conversation. Overall, a great experience.

<Title>“Great Hotel! 9/10!”
<Content>First of all i'd like to say that the staff at this hotel are some of the best i have ever encountered at a large resort. The hotel itself is massive, with two towers and i think about 20 floors in each. We were placed on the 18th floor and had a view of the city, and the bay. The rooms on the other side had views of the pool. The hotel is perfect position for getting around, all the great resteraunts of the gasslamp are only a short stroll away and the tram system, which is directly outside the hotel pretty much takes you anywhere you wish to go. Whilst we were staying a number of football teams we're also at the hotel and although this meant alot of teenagers it wasnt at all noisy. The only negative comment i have is the noise from the coastliner train, even until 4am it's extremely loud. For new years the hotel hosted 3 seperate events with varying costs involved, and although everyone seemed to be having fun we decided a meal at one of the resteraunts at seaport village was the best option. When we arived back at the hotel there was a large group of people sat around the firepits watching the fireworks over the bay. it was truely magical! The rooms were a nice size and cleaned to a very high standard. Overall i could not fault this hotel and compared to some of the other prices around it was very reasonable!

<Title>“Not worth the money”
<Content>I stayed at the "GRAND" Hyatt 2/21 - 2/26. The only thing Grand about this location is the Lobby. The lobby is BEAUTIFUL. That's it. The problem is, you don't sleep in the lobby. The rooms need a major upgrade. I requested for a microwave and fridge in my room. The microwave was delivered once I arrived and the attendant did not have any place to put it. He was going to put it on the floor next to my bed. I told him that would NOT work so he placed it on the desk. I was in complete shock. I had to work on a desk with a microwave. Hmmm, that was NOT acceptable. Then there was the curtains. I guess the curtains were loose but they fixed it by place visible blue tape on it. VERY tacky to say the least. I am SO happy I packed my Lysol. I needed it for the carpets and the comforter. There was just this odor that wouldn’t go away. It had nothing to do with the housekeeper. The rooms are just worn. I'm disgusted that so much money was spent on a place like this. In today's economy, we don't have money to throw away on mess. And that's EXACTLY what happened. During my stay, I spoke with numerous individual that had issues with their room. If this Hyatt wants to continue to be called Grand, they need to do an upgrade.

Want to use the fitness center? ca ching Want to use the pool? ca ching (actually the pool was being refurbished, the spa did let us use it but it was obvious that they did not like us there (had us go in by a side entrance). NO areas for relaxations, etc. Aslo they charge for internet

<Title>“Mixed experience”
<Content>In some ways, the hotel seemed to be well above average. In others, it seemed average or below average. In the end, it added up to a very mixed experience. The positives: beautiful views of the water and surrounding area; convenient downtown location; grand lobby; excellent seafood and sushi lunch at Sally's Restaurant; large gym. The negatives: small bedrooms; really small bathrooms; indifferent and unhelpful concierge (verging on rude); hotel seemed to cater to gigantic conventions and groups; extremely slow room service (took 1 hour and 20 minutes during peak dinner hour); bland food at room service; annoying and pompous photographs of the hotel's owner, "Papa" Doug Manchester, throughout the hotel. Will I stay here again? If I do, it's only because I need to earn more Hyatt points.

<Title>“Not Suite”
<Content>I reserved an executive suite at the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San Diego for my anniversary. I wanted something special. The hotel is beautiful with a great location. We checked into our suite though, and found that it's not a suite in any normal meaning of the word. It is two adjoining rooms with two locked doors in between. Yep, just like at the Holiday Inn when you take the kids. One room was fine. The usual hotel room. Bed, desk, chair. The second room was essentially identical, with a couch instead of a chair, and the bed folded up into the wall with two large gold handles sticking out so you could pull it down. I kid you not. I've stayed in many suites at some of the finest hotels. Now I know why there weren't any pictures of this "suite" on the website. We also noticed when we got to the room that it smelled terrible--someone had been smoking there recently and a lot. I was reading that card that said "this is a no-smoking room" as I called the front desk to ask what had happened. May we change rooms? No other rooms available. We'll send a guy; he'll fix the smoke. So sorry. Their guy shows up with a can of spray something, and assured us it will be better when we get back from dinner. It was 50 minutes until our dinner reservations, so we went to the bar on the 40th floor. Great location. Sat at a window table, and no one noticed us for twenty minutes. So I got up, and the waitress finally came over. She took our orders. Fifteen minutes later she came back and said "What did you order?" I told her again, and she brought it ten minutes later. I chugged my beer, we ate some of the bread and cheese, but left most of it (about $35.00 for one beer, one glass of wine, and a plate of bread and cheese). No time. My wife took her wine and we carried it down the elevator and out to the hotel's restaurant which is not attached to the hotel (Sally's). The restaurant was fine. The food was excellent, but the atmosphere was very loud. Marble floors, marble tables, loud silverware, no tablecloths etc. Not intimate at all. We asked for the chef's table as advertised on the website, but the concierge had never heard of it, nor had the restaurant. We were placed on a small but long table near everyone else. No big deal, but nothing special. We returned to the room, the guy with the can had placed some kind of air machine near the bed which remained there all night. Helped with the smoke. The lamp next to the bed was unplugged (had been when we got there) and there was no place to plug it in that I could see, even after moving the furniture. Then I turned on the television. No reception. So I moved the television and found the cable and screwed it back in to the TV. In summary, nice hotel in the big picture, but this "executive suite" is an insult. I thought I was going someplace special for a special event, but I was wrong.

<Title>“Great location and stunning views!”
<Content>The room was big and clean. We actually changed rooms after the first night - we requested a king bed and they gave us two fulls. The second room had absolutely stunning views of the water, tennis courts, and pool. The pool was great and they had two hot tubs. There were plenty of towels and pool chairs and space. They had a bar at the pool which made it even more convenient. The ballrooms were big and very elegant. The entire hotel looked new. It was a short cab ride or a 15 minute walk to the Gaslamp District, where we went for dinners and the bars. The only issue we had was with service. When we checked in, the woman gave us two double beds instead of a king. We said we requested a king bed, but she said "well this is the way it is because we're full" and didn't offer any suggestions. We ended up calling the front desk later that night and they got us another room by 9 am the next morning. The least she could have done is told us that - we just had to figure it out on our own. Other front desk people were great. The three people from concierge we talked to were completely unhelpful. All in all however, I think we would stay here again.

<Title>“Amazing, but I wish I had known . . .”
<Content>All the reviews are correct. It's an amazing place to stay! (Though I didn't have a flat screen TV - for the money we paid, I think I should have a flat screen.) I liked that the windows open. Coming from a cold New England January, it was great to open the windows in the morning feel a cool 60 degree breeze flow in. It felt like summer to us. The access to Seaport Village and the boardwalk leaves you with no shortage of options. Less than two miles from the airport and conveniently on North Harbor Drive, you'll have access to anything and everything, including a quick shot to Coronado - our favorite thing to do while there. (You must visit the Sundeck at the Hotel Del Coronado where you can enjoy a nice pastry or ice cream on the outdoor sofas by the fire pits). I wish I had known that there was a newer wing to the hotel; that there was a beautiful pool area above the lobby that we never knew existed because we assumed the pool we saw from our window was the main pool area. The main pool area is exquisite! I wish I had know a coke from the hotel bar would be $4 and parking in the hotel would be $17/night. Overall, San Diego turned out to be a little more expensive than I expected. Being from Boston, it's hard for me to get sticker shocked, but at times, I was; e.g. $24 for a pizza at Village Pizzaria in Coronado and a $7 eclair from the Hotel Del Coronado. I regret not trying the buffet at Lael's, a restaurant located in the hotel. Overall, I would definitely recommend the Manchester Grand Hyatt if you want to be close to it all. FYI - we ate at a place in the Gaslamp district called Chianti. Knowing good Italian food, this place was ok, but maybe it was stellar by San Diego standards. I recommend Gaslamp Pizza for a late night snack!

<Title>“Great Hotel, Great Location”
<Content>The Manchester Hyatt exceded all expectations. The Lobby really sets the tone for the entire hotel. Its huge and picturesque with high ceilings and many check in desks. The rooms were pretty nice, we didn't spend too much money and still got great quality. There are multiple restaurants and bars along with great gift shops. Its located right on the Boradwalk with all of the shops and great restaurants. You walk right out of the back and you are there. Our favorite was the secluded roof pool. It was January and unseasonably bad weather for San Diego, but the jacuzzi still worked, and there were lit fire pits along the edge with a great view of the city. The hotel is at the very southern tip of dowtown, so everything is pretty easy to get to, on foot if you wish to walk. We didn't walk much because it was cold and rainy most of the time. Overall, the hotel was great, room service was pretty promt, the decor was very elegant and made you feel like you were getting a lot for your money. I would love to return any time I am back in San Diego.

<Title>“It's a convention hotel”
<Content>The Grand Hyatt is large and fairly impersonal. The South tower is older and the rooms are smaller (although management swears this is not true, but it is. I moved from one suite in the North Tower to a "larger" and more expensive one in the south Harbor Tower and it is significantly smaller.) The southern view, however, is much better if you are on the outside of the building, and there is less noise and street traffic. The rooms are okay, but lack some of the amenities touted on the website and some things show lack of attention to detail... (non-working desk phones in both of the rooms I had makes me wonder if that is a coincidence or the norm). It seems the recession has slowed business down and a staff member told me that renovations are being deferred until business picks up again. The location is nice, although the touristy Seaport Village that surrounds the place seems mostly closed due to the economy and time of year. The food is very good. We ate in Sally's Seafood on the Water and it was quite a delicious lunch. The restaurant, however, was empty. Going to try Top of the Hyatt on the 40th floor tonight and see how that is. Impressive lobby and first floor. The rooms are pretty much standard-issue Hyatt. Fast elevators, which is nice, although this is hardly full occupancy, so I guess that is not a good time to determine elevator speed. The owner was a vocal supporter of Prop 8 in California and that has prevented some groups and conventions from staying at the hotel. Possibly that explains the lack of business as compared to the much more bustling hotels in the area. Overall, it is fine. Good location, near the airport, water views, within walking distance to most business traveler needs. I have stayed in several other hotels in this neighborhood, and liked them more, although this quite sufficient....

<Title>“It was really great”
<Content>I just got back from San Diego last week, staying at the Hyatt for 5 nights. We had connecting rooms for myself, my husband & 2 kids. The rooms were nice with extremely comfortable beds & pillows. I was a little worried beforehand about the connecting rooms because we have to have them since our kids are younger. They had "guaranteed" connecting rooms when I made the reservation and we actually got them! The maid service was just okay (they kind of clean around your stuff laying around). We had several things laundered and that was done very nicely. The breakfast buffet at Lael's was spectacular but pricey ($24 per adult, $12 per child). The sports bar had great appetizers & darts/billiards - this was fun for the family to hang out after a day of sightseeing and relax. The hotel is located next to Seaport Village which was not that great. The hotel is within walking distance to the Gaslamp Quarter (be sure to go to Blue Point Seafood Restaurant - it was awesome!). You can also walk to the USS Midway which was very interesting. We would definitely stay there again!

<Title>“Not a 4 Star Hotel - expect Super 8 Level”
<Content>Just returning from a 3 night stay - that would have been cut short, but there is a penalty for eraly check-out and our package gave us our third night for free. Let me start with the positives: 1. Our room, after changing it around, had a fantastic view. We could see the USS Midway, the water and some of the city. It was by far the best part of the experience. Now for the rest: 1. We waited over 12 hours to receive a crib for my little one. We called numerous times and was ready to go buy one since it was 11pm and we had a baby crying, needing to go to bed. 2. We requested a microwave and fridge. We did not receive the microwave and the fridge looked like it had been in a war. 3. When the crib finally arrived, we got the blankets out of the closet for the crib and they were soiled and dirty. We had to give him the 2 bath towels tas blankets. That left us with no towels the next morning for our shower. We requested them and no towels were brought until after our shower. My husband used a hand towel to dry off on. 4. We did not even notice until after my 3 year old had slept on the pillow, but his pillow had blood stains on it. YUCK! When I went to the front desk to tell them about these items, the clerk just said oh. ?!?!?!?!?! 5. Upon returning to our room on day 2 - our room was barely cleaned. My husband ending up wiping up the bathroom floor. The shower had not been cleaned etc... The front desk offered to give us free breakfast or a credit on our bill for the hassle. That was after speaking with the front desk supervisor. We will not be returing to this hotel on a future San Diego trip. We will also not recommend that others do so. I value the reviews on tripadvisor - please feel free to contact me with any questions. Thanks!

<Title>“Don't worth if you pay more than $100”
<Content>After 2 nights stay, I have to say I don't recommend it for travelers have to pay more than $100 for it because of the service, cleanliness, quietness and price. We got a deal for $95/night for a King room and reserved it one week ahead. When checking in, we were told the only room available was 2 double beds room. That was not an honest way to do business. In compensation, we were offered a higher floor room for the bay view. The view was great! However, the window was like not been cleaned for years! The blanket under the sheet was dirty, with curvy hair entangled in it. The entrance hall looked fabulous, but the decor inside was grandma old. TV was a CRT, not flat screen, let alone LCD. I felt like in a Best Western or Holiday Inn Express. The washroom was big. The shower was OK but the tap didn't stop when the shower was on. There were a train track just in the front of the hotel. When it passed at night, the train whistle was loud and so frequent and it was moving so slow. You still hear the airport plane noise over distance and the neighbor room's TV. Every complimentary service in other hotel was charged here. Consider it's right in downtown, it was normal. Breakfast was so expensive. You have a choice of buffet or continental. The difference is for continental, you cannot touch the hot food except the oatmeal. The food was tasty, fruit was so fresh and high quality. But for $40 for 2 person, I say, go to other place. For comparison, the Treasure Island in Las Vegas, it was way better.

<Title>“It was OK but not great”
<Content>I arrived on November 20th for the NATCOM Convention. I got a special rate (140USD per night) which included a basic lower-floor room, but the girl at the lobby offered me a better room for the same rate. The room was o.k. for the rate I got, though I would not pay full rate for it. My only complaints about the room are the old TV furniture which was also very low for watching TV in bed and the charge for WIFI, I found 10USD per day excessive and you can't even charge it to your hotel deposit account, you'll need a direct charge to your credit card. If you're required to leave a 100-dollar deposit for the first night and an extra 50-dollar deposit for each additional night, you should be able to use that money on any hotel service. Also, pillows are not very comfortable but the bed and the chair with the ottoman are. The view from the Top of the Hyatt is great, I went to there one night and even if you don't get a window table, you will still get a nice view. Although there are plenty of elevators, they still get crowded during conventions and sometimes you'll have to wait several minutes for one to arrive. I did not get to go to any of their restaurants since they close quite early. Instead I used the room service which has a poor menu, it's pretty overpriced, and the food is not tasty. Bell boys were very helpful, I was trying to schedule a taxi service for next day and one of them got me a town car which charged taxi fare. Unfortunately desk personal besides the with whom I checked in were not that helpful. Two nights in a raw there was nobody at the concierge desk but there was an ad asking guests to go to the front desk instead. I did that but they could not arrange a taxi for me to get back to the airport and the day I checked out there was none at all in the desk. When I finally got somebody to get to the desk, the guy threw the bill to me and said "that's it", no thank you for your stay, no nothing, When I spend more that 800USD in a hotel or in anything for that matter, I expect people to be kind.

<Title>“Good for business travelers and those who like big hotels”
<Content>This hotel is big (not Las Vegas big). There are two towers and a huge lobby that connects them. I was in San Diego for a convention and when I checked in there were only double rooms available. I had to wait 2 hours for a king room. I didn't mind waiting because I was the first in my group to get to the hotel, but I could see where this could be a problem for other guests. Positives: - Large room and great view of the ocean -- plenty of room to work if you are a business traveler - Great top floor bar with amazing views of the water and surrounding area - Convenient location to the convention center - Walking distance to the gaslamp district (10-15 minutes) although wouldn't recommend if you have limited mobility Negatives: - The hotel appears to be understaffed (had to wait for a room, valet took a while, room service took an hour) - Too far to walk to the gaslamp if you have mobility issues - Service is lacking if you - Bathroom is nothing special (ceramic tile)

<Title>“Overpriced everything!”
<Content>While I can say nothing but wonderful things about the view, the location and the cleanliness, I would not return to this hotel. The lobby and the pool area are beautiful, but the rooms are no more than anything you'd find at a Holiday Inn Express with probably the same decorator! Along with the outrageous price of the room, self-parking is $20/day; internet is $10+/day; no breakfast; on top of all this, they charge $1 for every local call! As far as I could tell, the Hyatt did not have the free shuttle that our friends had at MUCH less expensive hotel. Beyond the outrageous prices, our stay had other issues. When I pay over $200/nite for a room, I don't think it is asking too much to have a hot shower and a quiet night's sleep. We stayed 4 nights and took cold showers every day. After about 10 minutes, the shower would turn scalding hot. Would not adjust to warm; just cold or HOT! I did report this to the front desk after the first day, but she did not seem the least bit concerned. Apparently, this hotel is Christmas party central. I'm no Scrooge....I love a Christmas party, unless I'm trying to sleep at 2:30 in the morning and the party has moved to our floor. We called the front desk and the party continued AT LEAST until 3:am. when I finally was able to fall back asleep. Upon check-out, I spoke with a manager and told him how disappointed we were with our stay and expressed that I thought the charge for the internet was outrageous given the price of the rooms. He said that they are comparable to other full service hotels in the area. Bottom line is this......full service hotels are only full service if you have your wallet WIDE OPEN! My future stays will be at a non-full-service hotel with breakfast, free internet, free parking, free local phone calls, hot water, a quiet night's sleep, and a complimentary shuttle. Maybe Hyatt needs to re-evaluate what "full-service" really means.

<Title>“Nice hotel, nothing special”
<Content>We stayed three nights for a conference. I booked here because it was easier than commuting from another hotel, and it was easy. We had view rooms, and the view is... ok, the room is better than ok... but not in line with other $300 dollar a night rooms I stay in. The restaurants was ok..... and pretty expensive, especially at breakfast. $70 for two people with tip. Stay here if you must... but I really would have preferred trying the Hard Rock or the Omni.

<Title>“Nice hotel but big!”
<Content>This is a very nice hotel, a typical Hyatt. It's huge, which I don't care for, but I was there for a convention. The staff was incredibly nice. The hotel put six chairs in my room for a meeting at no charge, and didn't charge me for a late check out after I had to stay in my room for that meeting. A room service dinner was nice at an ok price. Spa services were overpriced even for a hotel

<Title>“Location, location, but....”
<Content>I had been in the Grand Hyatt previously for a meeting. The location was next to Seaport Village and just yards to the water. The grand reception area can take your breath away. Friendly staff at check-in, restaurant and bar. The view out our window was spectacular of the harbor. Now, my down side of this place. When we had arrived, there were hundreds of teenagers in front of the hotel. In the parking structure, the teenagers were screaming. There were staff members operating the elevators, the kids running up and down the halls. I was told there was a teen event at the convention center this weekend. I wished the Hotel's website (Meetings & Events) would have mentioned this noisy event. Internet cost is $10 per day, and restricts location where you sign up (which tower, lobby or room). Overall, the stay was nice and convenient (location).

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel and was very, very pleased with my stay. I got a FANTASTIC deal on Travelzoo, and thus only paid $99 per night. I found that for this price, this was an excellent hotel. It has a grand lobby and our room, in the Sea Tower, was on the 14th floor and had a lovely view of the harbor. The beds were comfortable, the room itself was quite spacious, and the bathroom was quite spacious as well. I went to visit family so I did not go to any of the attractions, but I believe it is in a good location - it is right next to Seaport and appears to be about a 5-10 minute walk into the Gaslamp area. The only reason I am giving it a 4 and not a 5 is because I did not go to any of the restaurants, or utilize any hotel services such as the concierge, so I feel I cannot rate for something I did not use. Also, the hotel is categorized as a 5 star, but I feel it is more like a very nice 4 star. I consider hotels such as Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton to be 5 stars, and this hotel is not in that category. This is a great hotel and I recommend a stay here, especially if you find a great deal. I think if I had paid $300 or more per night I would feel slightly ripped off because there is nothing about the rooms or the service that is exceptional and worthy of that higher price, but if you find something in the mid $200 range or less, this is definitely a great place to stay!

<Title>“All one could expect”
<Content>Just stayed for two nights while on business and was quite satisfied. Having stayed in San Diego a couple of other times, I can't imagine a better location in the downtown area. Just a few minutes from SAN, right on the water, and Seaport Village is right outside the door/ Fine business center and a staff that went the extra mile to help me, including an upgrade upon checking in at no extra charge. I stayed in the newer tower, so I can't speak for the older rooms, but the room was what you would expect from a Grand Hyatt. Nothing to write home about but clean and of high quality.

<Title>“Romantic Weekend”
<Content>We secured an extremely comfortable King-size room with out standing views. Everything abut the hotel is top notch (great service, efficient and knowledgeable, restaurants are wonderful, etc...) The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was large with a decent closet. The bed linens were very nice and had a high cotton count in the material. Very soft and sleek. Nice assortment of TV stations - something for everyone. Toiletries are good quality and well-stocked. Pool was nice as were the whirlpools. Beautiful views over the harbor - expecially at sunset. We really enjoyed the location - there are amny restaurants in the neighborhood, fun shops, and all around beautiful setting. SeaPort was also a very nice place to pass a few hours. Easy access to GasLamp District, Horton Shopping, SD Zoo, ferries to Coronado Island - it's all right at your doorstep We were very comfortable at the Hyatt and would definitely stay again.

<Title>“Grand Property!”
<Content>Hotel is right on the waterfront; walk out the back right into the entrance of Seaport Village where there were many dining options. Walk along the seawall, to the cruise ship terminal. There you can take the MSS Midway tour which is great (set aside 3-4 hours though). We took the "Duck" tour which was half land and half water. We happen to be there during Fleet Week and saw many ships entering and leaving the harbor. Shopping is also a short walk away as well as the Gaslamp Quarter which has many restaurants and bars. Great place to go to in the evenings. Use the transit rail system; it can take you many places even to the border where Las Americas outlet mall (one of the biggest) is. One night we did head out by taxi to Old Town where any of the Mexican restaurants there will be more than happy to see you. Great food and atmosphere! The room itself is very nice, as you would expect with a Hyatt property. This hotel is family owned and managed and you can tell by the attention to details and well trained staff. The bars and restaurants are good too, and the pool was a highlight. Overall, a very nice property.

<Title>“Fantastic!!!”
<Content>My fiancee and i stayed here for three nights during the US Open and could not have been happier! We took the Amtrak from Anaheim to SD and stopped at the Sante Fe Depot right downtown. From there we walked three blocks to our lovely hotel by the bay. As soon as you walk in, you can't help but be impressed with the GRAND lobby, very very nice. Check in was such a breeze! The staff was very friendly and had us checked in in 10 minutes. The lady who helped us was nice enough to give us a room on the 27th floor in the southeast tower with a fantastic view of the bay! The rooms were very nice and the bed was very comfortable. The location of the hotel is great! There is a trolley stop right across the street and the gas lamp is a few blocks away. We would definetly stay here again! BTW, make sure to grab a drink and watch the sunset at the Top of the Hyatt bar!

<Title>“Great location!”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel for a conference. The best thing about the hotel is the location and it's proximity to seaport village. It is a short taxi ride to the zoo/Balboa park too (about $12). The rooms are general - beds, tv, chair, desk. they had an ipod deck. and when I asked for a fridge and microwave for our 2 year old - they brought them up right away. The bathroom are also pretty big. Not a lot of drawer space, but I used the shelves in the bathroom for clothes too. The pool area is nice with a play area for kids.

<Title>“The lobby is grand but the rooms? Not so much...”
<Content>We stayed at this property once before, when the new lobby and tower were under construction (2003)--it is as though the rooms in the Seaport Tower have not been renovated since that time as ours appeared worn and tired, particularly the bathroom. The location is terrific and once again we had a fabulous view of the bay and surrounding area. Not sure what is so Grand about this Hyatt, however, other than the public areas which are very nice as is the pool. Oh, and the price--they must have the market cornered to charge the fees they do for such an average room--thank goodness for the views! If ever we find ourselves in San Diego purely for pleasure I would not stay here and only did so because of husband's business meeting.

<Title>“I Really Liked It”
<Content>I have to say, I really liked this hotel. It is so close to everything and the views are just great. I also found the staff very helpful and friendly. The rooms, while not the best I have every stayed in, are nice and very clean. The lobby is spectacular and the stay was quiet and very enjoyable. If I go back to San Diego (and I hope I do because it is an amazing city) I will stay here again. Just one little thing… I like the bottom sheet on the bead to be fitted. A tucked in flat sheet doesn’t do it for me and I wish a nice hotel like this one had not pulled that.

<Title>“Great location, beautiful view and service”
<Content>Came to the Manchester for a convention, have been here all week. Very happy with the room in the Harbor Tower, and with the fantastic view. The hotel is just a couple of blocks to the Convention Center, where the main convention was held. However, the first half of the week was business meetings in the Manchester, itself. I couldn't be happier with the service for the meetings, the restaurants, the gift shop, and the room. The rooms are thoroughly cleaned each day - I saw the maid actually scrubbing down the wall of my shower. I like the triple sheeting and 6 pillows. Room service was fast, and a big cheeseburger with all the fixins' and huge serving of fries cost $24, including tip. (I do wish they'd brought a glass of water, though.) Sally's had a great chicken sandwich and blackened tuna. There is the problem of the one cup at a time coffee maker. I didn't even bother getting a key to the mini bar refrigerator with its $10 a day restocking fee if you use it for your own stuff. I did end up buying one of the $4.50 bottles of water because I don't like the taste of the tap water in San Diego. The spa is a good deal if you feel like some pampering. My one hour massage also bought me an afternoon with the steam shower, jacuzzi, a private lap pool and dried fruit and water while lounging in the sun and shade with a book. I could have ordered pool side food and drink, too. The hotel backs up to Seaport Village, a beautiful park and shopping area. (My husband and I bought hats, ate a couple of meals. ) The first day I came, there was an art show along the shore. Just across Harbor Drive is the Gaslamp area with shopping and tons of unique restaurants. (Enjoyed meals at Osetra with their wine fairies and La Bocca.) There's a Ralph's grocery 5 blocks from the hotel. Watch out for the pedicabs - $30 a person if you don't haggle. The shuttle from the airport cost me $8 one way. My husband came later and his taxi was $12. We took the Old Town trolley tour for $32 each, getting off on Coronado Island for a walk on the beach, browsing at a book store, and ice cream.

<Content>The hotel handy for the convention center but while staying I found the owner is the biggest funder of Prop 8 (the one to deny all Californians the right to marry) I WISH I knew this before giving them my money, San Diego is typically 'family' friendly so this was a shock. This put a cloud over my entire stay - without this issue the hotel was, OK.

<Title>“Huge Let Down”
<Content>My wife and I stayed there Labor Day Weekend. We love San Diego and chose it based on the brand, proximity to the sites, and the great rate we found. Our stay started off with a bed sheet with stains that still make my stomach turn. The staff was either embarrassed or just angry about my complaint. Our trip ended with me being accosted by one of the self important staff for slouching in a couch with my eyes shut for a brief moment. Before that, we were woken up at 2:00 AM and kept up all night by a neighboring room full of drunken girls. It took two calls to the front desk a half hour apart and an hour+ of aggravation for them to quiet down. There were many nice people there, especially at the concierge and bell desks, but the few things that happened were preventable and inexcusable. If you want a deal and potential for aggravation, stay here. If you want a great San Diego visit, go to the Coronado instead. There was a huge protest outside while we were there. I could see why locals hate the place. Hyatt should be ashamed.

<Title>“Big, Convention hotel for San Diego”
<Content>Stayed for 3 nights on business in Aug in a standard double bed guestroom. The beds are comfortable but the rooms are starting to look a little "tired". I forsee a renovation in the next couple of years from Mr Manchester. There is wireless and wired internet in the room ($9.95 per 24hrs) and also an Ihome ipod docking station/alarm clock radio. The lobby restaurant and bar are very expensive as expected in a hotel this size. The fitness center is large and in good working order. The pool area is filled with many, many children and families during the day and also at night. Pay the extra $30 per day to use the private Spa pool if you can afford it. The fire pits at night are a good spot to relax by the pool. Smores kits are available for purchase in the lobby grab n go shop. Parking is $20 per day with unlimited in and out. Guests can easily and safely walk to the Gaslamp Quarter. I highly recommend Richard Walker's Pancacke house for breakfast. Pinkberry just opened in the Gaslamp so that's a great spot for frozen yogurt at any time of the day. Seaport Village is located directly behind the hotel and has a few restaurants and shops to browse. I would not return to this hotel. Check out the Hilton Gaslamp or the very cool Marriott Gaslamp (you will not be disappointed) if you come to this area of San Diego.

<Content>Family of 4 stayed at the Hyatt for 3 nights 8/13-8/16. Room on 22nd floor was nothing fancy but clean and comfortable with a great view of bay. Decent size bathroom. Maid service kept up room great. Common areas of hotel are beautiful. Pool area is nice with extras for the kids like pingpong tables, foose ball and hula hoops. The location of the Hyatt is great for all things to visit in San Diego. Trolley right outside the door. Petco park and Gaslight district within easy walking distance. I will agree you can hear the trains even on the 22nd floor. Only one time during the night but I am a light sleeper. No one else in my family heard the train whistle. I would defintely stay here again.

<Content>Stayed here for a conference. This place, with its lobby of huge faux-woodland murals, its gallery of pictures of 'Papa Doug' with buddies like Arnold and Katherine Harris, among others, and its pretensions of glamour and sophistication, rings hollow. The pretensions end at the elevators - the room was 'average' to say the least. Will not go back.

<Title>“Great location but disappointed”
<Content>A big plus for this property is its location. The housekeeping staff did a great job keeping the room tidy and the staff at the parking garage were friendly. As I was staying at the hotel for a conference held there and it being summer vacation season, the garage ran pretty full and parking was difficult during the first few days. The hotel staff seemed to do a great job with the conference. Front desk staff and staff answering the hotel phone could use more training--generally, not the most helpful group during my stay. I did not get the type of room I had reserved and during check out, I was unable to get a receipt due to "computer system turnover." The morning I did checkout, I had to call the courtesy phone at the front desk so that someone would help me. The staff member seemed put out that she had to help me when she did arrive. I am still trying to get a receipt for my stay; interestingly, I receive slightly different information each time I call about this. The room is noisy. The first night I stayed there, I was awakened at 4am by train horns. Unfortunately, this was not an isolated event. Granted my room was just off the elevator, so I heard everyone as they were getting off the elevator when they came in for the night/morning. There were loud motorized sounds (the elevator?) and I knew when others on the floor were taking showers/flushing toilets/using the water, because I could hear water flowing. Overall okay for the conference, but would definitely stay somewhere else next time I am in town.

<Title>“Hyatt has got it all”
<Content>Had the pleasure of staying at the Manchester Hyatt for a business trip recently and it is the perfect San Diego Hotel for many reasons. The location being the best reason, close to the Gaslamp, Petco, the USS Midway, etc. You can walk everywhere or take the street trolley. Pool, conciege, gym are all top notch except that they let kids play in the jacuzzi, not happy about that and pretty annoying. It's expensive for the most part, but nothing over the top. We had a nice room and most rooms have nice views of the harbor. Food was a rip off, so don't eat there. They do however have 2 fantastic bars, the first is the Top of Hyatt, on the top floor, great views. The second it the KIN lounge, just opened, great outdoor lounge, more upscale though, no shorts or sandals. To sum it up, close to the airport, close to all attractions including the zoo, so what's not to like? We checked out the Marriott next door as well, better pool, all rooms have balconies, and more of a modern look if that's what you're into.

<Title>“Terrific Hotel - Fantastic Location!”
<Content>My family and I stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt for 7 nights this month. We had two rooms, both of which were very clean and comfortable. It is a very large hotel - lots of conference attendees where there during our visit, not many families. Staff was friendly and attentive. Fabulous view of San Diego Bay! 4th floor pool was very nice, although drinks and food were expensive. We really enjoyed renting bikes from the hotel - we rode 4 times during our 7 day stay - a really great way to see/learn about the city. There was a doorman there - Michael - who was wonderful. He was friendly and very helpful when pointing us in the right direction on our bikes. Even made sure to tell us where NOT to go! Very much appreciated! Lots to do close to the hotel - Seaport Village (shopping, restaurants), harbor cruise, Old Town Trolley, The Midway etc. Really fun activities! Staff at Redfields cafe was not very friendly. They really made it seem like waiting on customers was a burden. We ended up going to the cafe out the back side of the hotel - AnnMarie's. The staff there was friendly, worked hard AND their prices were less expensive than Redfields. Do yourself a favor and go to the grocery store, Ralph's - only three blocks away. The bottled water in the room was $4.50 a bottle. Maid service was very good. Only downside of this hotel was the train noise. Amtrak and frieght trains travel close by and seem to always be blowing their whistles! Location, views, activities, staff really make this hotel stand out. Great job Manchester!

<Title>“will look elsewhere next time”
<Content>Despite booking back in February for 6 nights for a party of 4, arrived to find the first night overbooked. Hotel offer to accommodate us at the very luxurious Grand del Mar looked good on paper, but we were jetlagged, looking forward to going downtown for the baseball game and unimpressed with having to travel 13 miles three times over the evening. Even less impressed when we discovered we had been allocated the last queen room, which even with a rollaway left one child with nowhere to sleep, which the Hyatt knew full well before sending us up there. Luckily we got a cancellation. OK, so the Hyatt compensated us, but it was all so impersonal and inconvenient, especially travelling with kids. Pool closed one afternoon when someone got sick, and overall just a hotel with a complete lack of any ambience or personality.

<Title>“Loved the Manachester Grand Hyatt”
<Content>This hotel is conveniently located next door to Seaport Village and across the street from the GasLamp district. Location, location, location. We got a great room rate from Priceline at $95.00 - awesome. We were on the 31st floor - pool/oceanview. We had a king bed which was nice and comfy. We were missing a remote for the t.v. - I placed a call to the front desk and within 10 mins., we had a remote. Check-in/check-out was easy. The staff was great. No complaints (which is good). I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Nice on the surface-beware”
<Content>Upon arrival in San Diego, we couldn't wait to get into our room. The first room smelled on smoke and had cigarette ashes in the sink, so we were moved to a "better" room with a great view. We unpacked and headed out. When we climbed into bed, the sheets were wet with urine! I called housekeeping, which is closed at 10:30, and then the front desk. All they could offer was clean sheets. I told them we'd both sleep in the other bed, since it was just my daughter and me. I stripped the sheets off the bed for them to be changed. The next night, around the same time, climbed into bed to find them smelly and slightly wet. The sheets had been changed but the mattress pad was still really wet. So I called down again. They offered to let us change rooms, but at 11:00 pm it was too late. So I stripped it again, and laid a blanket from the closet on top and some fresh sheets. The next day, mattress pad that I removed was gone, but the blanket was still on the bed in its place. Called down again, and they offered free breakfast for the following morning in which we were leaving. ONce we arrived home, I emailed the hotel and the customer service of the Hyatt. Their offer was if we traveled and stayed at a Hyatt, to call a number and they would upgrade us, if it was available. So beware!

<Title>“Great for Families”
<Content>Just came back from a great stay at the Hyatt. If you are looking to stay in a five star hotel, that would be close to everything,and has the best view of San Diego, this is it. We stayed in the smallest suite in the harbor towers. The room accomodated ,two adults, two teens, and two tweens, well. We had two rooms and a parlor on the 25th floor. The beds were very comfortable and the room was clean. The view was amazing and so was the service. The kids loved the pool and the fire pits. After a dip, the kids warmed up to the fire and we made s'mores. We took the train down from LA and we did not need a car at all for the visit. We saved money on food by requesting a microwave in our room for no extra charge.

<Title>“Good location,mediocre hotel”
<Content>We stayed for 4 nights and if you don't pay the full price, it's O.K., but nothing to write home about. No vent in the bathroom.... It's and old hotel, and i booked it for location on priceline. Get a hyatt gold pass- it's free- and you get the gym for free and can shower, even after check out. Yes, they charge extra for EVERYTHING. We don't watch TV, but it's one of those old ones, small picture, big box. No balcony, windows open just enough for the kids to through things out, but not enough to get some air, or them falling out. Get a room high up, otherwise you'll be up with the train schedule.... Parking $ 28/day, self park $20/day. We did not try the restaurant, there are so many places to eat, why do hotel food. They told us the pool was heated- it was just as cold as the ocean and windy. It's on the 4th floor- nice view. If you like the ocean, dive there. Our kids loved the ocean better. Sea World was nice, Wild Animal Park underwhelming! Our Zoo is better and a lot less. Ralph's is only s blocks up on Market street- get the snacks there. We have a 2 year old and a 4 year old and it was fine, b/c the location is super.

<Title>“My Favorite Hotel in Downtown San Diego”
<Content>In my opinion, this is the best hotel in downtown San Diego. The hotel is excellent. The location is excellent, the views are great (especially if you get a higher floor), and the staff is very friendly! Some of the furnishings in our room were a little worn, but still in better shape than other downtown hotels in San Diego we've tried. The bed was very comfortable, and the room was clean. We stayed in the older tower (furnishings are probably more updated in the new tower). Parking is a little expensive at $20/day, but at least it is convenient and there's plenty of parking (we stayed at the Embassy Suites one time...Valet parking was required there...and we waited 30 mintues or so for our car each time we wanted to go somewhere). The SeaPort village is next door...and it is a tourist trap (as someone else alreay mentioned). However, it's a fun tourist trap for my family. We don't usually buy much in the stores, but we like the restaurants like the Edgewater Grill. Another of our favorite restaurants, The Fish Market, is also nearby. We were fortunate to get a better deal than most through a Priceline bid. We paid much less than the typical rate...I'd still pay the full rate to stay here again.

<Title>“Typical, nothing special”
<Content>Bid $100 on a 4 star hotel in downtown san diego a few weeks ago...which accepted on my first bid. I probably should have bid lower. The Hyatt is your typical 4 star hotel. Clean. Newish in both lobby and our room on the 28th floor. The location is quite good if you want to be downtown and on the water. great views. free cookies and juice in the lobby. It has all the downfalls of a 4 star hotel (overpriced food and services), and in my particular experience, none of the benefits in terms of extra service and customer care. When I call for maintenance at even a 2 star hotel -- at least they show up. My telephone did not work, which required me to walk down and ask to have this fixed (thats fine). At first, they told me to wait until the morning. I insisted that this be corrected so i could at least order room service, polite of course. Nobody shows up. Nobody fixes it the next day. Next evening, same story. I asked the front desk again (different folks), even was told to wait until tomorrow or use my cell phone. Finally i got someone to come up after much needless debate, 5 minutes of telephone maintenance later, everything was fine. How hard was that? I understand that things go wrong everyday in a hotel, but at the very least, please listen to your customers basic maintenance requests.

<Title>“Everything costs extra - for nothing.”
<Content>This hotel looks better in the photos and is not so fancy as you would expect. The biggest disappointment for me was that everything costs extra, even ridiculous things. For example, if you place your own juice in the minibar ("refreshment center" as they want to call it), you will have to pay 10 dollars for "restocking fee". If you want to empty the minibar and place your own preferred items there, they will charge 25 dollars handling fee for this. I found this ridiculous! The gym costs as well, even if in the website you get the image that it is free. 20 dollars for three days, just stair machines, ellipticals and free weights! The wi-fi costs extra. You get the impression it would be free. The rooms are ok, but certainly not worth for 300 dollars per night. The bathrooms look old and used. There is no complimentary breakfast and the restaurants are expensive and just mediocre. The Seaport Village next door is a tourist trap and I had worst pizza there I have ever eaten. The pool and the views are nice, though, and the overall impression of the hotel is quite clean.

<Title>“Overall A Great Stay at the Manchester Grand Hyatt”
<Content>We stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt this past weekend. My parents were attending a conference and booked an additional room for us. Despite some initial hiccups, our stay was quite nice. Although my parents booked at the conference rate, they were graciously upgraded to a 28th floor Bay View room for the entire stay. When we joined them over the weekend, my parents were told that the Hyatt would try to accomdate us in a room next to their room. Apparently, the person in the next room was a late check out and there some coordination problems with housekeeping so we ended up waiting almost three hours to get a room. We checked back with the front desk periodically and it was frustrating to be told that it would just take a few minutes longer. To their credit, the front desk was always polite. We were trying to be patient since we had been promised a great room next to my parents. Finally after two 1/2 hours I called housekeeping directly to find out what was going on. To make a long story short, after three hours, we took a room three doors down with the same gorgeous Bay View and a King size bed. With two kids in tow, we would have preferred double beds but we managed. Room service is pricey but the food was pretty good and delivered quickly. It is true that the elavators are a bit slow but the place is incredibly busy! I would have preferred a bigger and less crowded pool too. Otherwise, service was fine. Sally's by the Bay serves an incredible and reasonably priced brunch on Sundays from 10-3. They even have a great kids menu. Overall, it was a very nice experince and I would stay at the Grand Hyatt again.

<Title>“Great location, nice hotel.”
<Content>I stayed at the Manchester Grand for a work conference, and since it was much nicer than the hotels I usually stay at on business, I was pretty satisfied. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could. The pool was absolutely beautiful, the view from my room spectacular, and the food at the restaurants and from room service was above average hotel food. The service I received from the concierge and bell staff was also good. The bed was very comfortable. And..the location. Right next to Seaside Village which is full of touristy shops and restaurants, and a short walk from the Gaslamp quarter, which has great shopping and excellent dining choices. You're also a short walk from the marina area where you can check out a giant aircraft carrier and some tall ships. The down-sides: *when I got into my room, the toilet paper roll was half empty as was the bottle of lotion on the sink. This was the first time I have ever experienced that in a hotel, and it kind of grossed me out. When you go to a hotel, you aren't supposed to see any sign of the people who stayed in the room before you!! *Guests had to pay additional costs to use the fitness center and wireless internet. For the cost of this hotel, I would expect these things to be included. Overall it was a good stay, but I don't know that I'd stay there if I was footing the bill myself.

<Title>“Slightly Disappointed”
<Content>We visited the Grand Hyatt back in 2006 and were excited to stay again as we loved it. As it turned out, we were a bit disappointed as it's become quite "worn" in some areas. I booked ahead and received a discounted rate but for someone paying full price, the value simply isn't there. The lobby area is beautiful but when you reach the elevator area, there's a stench of what seems to be a water/sewer issue. We noticed it on each floor. The rooms are rather small and ready for some updating. The carpet was dirty but the view was nice and the bed was comfortable. There's a sign in the bathroom indicating that linens are only replaced upon request in order to conserve water and energy which is a great idea. However, the housekeeping was somewhat lacking. We had dirty glassware left in our room day after day. We even tried setting it on the floor in the hallway but there it stayed. We occupied our room for six nights and not once was the room vacuumed. There was also an awful smell each time we turned on the bathroom sink - like sewage. The Bellmen were very helpful and courteous. The staff at the Concierge desk were also very knowledgeable. The pool is nice but definitely in need of more shade. There are a few cabanas but other than that, no shady areas for those who need to avoid the sun. We attended the July 4th BBQ and while the food was tasty, it was mayhem. They ran out of several items in the first few minutes and the line backed up. I used the workout room and it was extremely state of the art and clean. Overall, I would stay at the Hyatt again if the price was good just for the location but it's definitely not worth the $299 per night as I'm sure some guests paid.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>Hubby & I, are Experienced travelers. Before staying here, we researched what others on this website had to say. The Manchester Grand Hyatt hotel was a very pleasant experience. Fabulous location, location, location. Our room was very nicely appointed, but was not a suite. But then, we did not book or pay for a suite. We were very happy with our room. We stayed on the 30th floor of the older tower. Views? OMG! Beds and pillows- were great. Room was great-just remember- we did not pay for, or stay in a suite. This review is for a standard room. Hospitality and Personnel- excellent and friendly. If you, like us, want to bring a cooler of some kind, and some groceries- un-like other hotels we've stayed at- you will not be looked down upon. We stayed on July 4th. A very busy day for all water front locations in this area. We booked our room- using hotwire.com and paid a measly $159. for our room (prior to tax). Truly a deal and 1/2. My one caveat, is that I wanted to use the spa-and was told ahead of time, that day usage of the spa for a hotel guest would cost $10. We went to the spa, and we were told it would now cost $25. HUH, over a 24 hour period the cost went up 2 and 1/2 times? Apparently YES. I did ask for the manager, told her I'd been quoted $10. for a full day of the spa "yesterday", she explained that yes-management had increased the charge to $25. However, she would honor the $10. we'd been quoted the day before. (hurumph-well I should think so). In regards to the spa. The men's and women's are separate, each has a sauna, steam room, lockers and bathrooms separate. Together-there are lounging areas, a private pool and spa (no kiddies allowed). A wonderfull pool and jacuzzi area with views to die for overlooking the bay, the boats and the ocean. Truly worth it, if it's a busy time, and you don't want to be around children. The workout room, cost a gues $5.00. But- it is pretty impressive and worth the money for sure. The hotel itself- the lobby, the bars, the restaurants and the gift shops- are all well appointed, with fabulous artwork- fixtures, flat screen TV's and great service. IF- you happen to go on July 4th. I don't think there is a better place to see Fireworks in all of San Diego. Even my "I really don't care about Firework's" hubby was impressed with the show that was put on. We would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat. PS: If you're into sailing- right in front of the hotel (on the water) you can rent a 25' Catalina Sailboat for two hours for $108. For breakfast- mosey over to the Edgewater Cafe. Great people watching, reasonable food, right on the water. For dinner- We would recommend: "Roy's Asian Fusion Cusine" less expensive then "Sally's" way better, and world famous. *But, make an early reservation for Roy's. Or, you will miss out!

<Title>“Best service ever!!!”
<Content>I just returned from a conference at Grand Hyatt in San Diego. First, the location and views are excellent. It is great to wake up, open the blinds, and see the ocean and Coronado Bridge. The breakfast buffet is pricey--$25.00--but it offers extensive hot choices and some of the best muffins and freshest fruit I have ever eaten at a buffet. My room was clean, the bed was top quality, and the linens soft to the skin. They have an ihome so you can plug in your ipod. For me the biggest selling point for this hotel was the service. I am a frequent traveler and I have NEVER received such great service from every employee I met--the folks at the front desk, the servers at the buffet, the cleaning service--all bent over backwards to keep us happy and did it with a smile. They are doing something right at this hotel.

<Title>“Very pleased”
<Content>Bid 153$ a night for a 4 star in San Diego and this was the place we were allocated. Unlike a previous reviewer i was very glad to be offered the 2 for1 breakfast deal at check in as 20$ for 2 adults is a great price. The food at the buffet was excellent and at those prices you would hard pressed to obtain food that was as nice at an outside venue. If you are not offered it I would suggest ask for it! The room was OK but the queen beds were definitely on the small size, with my wife and i being slim it was not too bad but by American hotel standards I would say they were a bit too cozy. The decor in the public areas is very nice and reminded me of being in the concourse of a posh railway station, all very grand. The rooms at my price point did not have quite the same feel as the public areas but were ok .if a little drab. The hotel seems to cater to a lot of conferences and as a result you may be able to pick up a free wifi signal from your room. The local area had some great restaurants and was within walking distance of the gaslamp district so you will be spoiled for choice. As stated earlier the buffet breakfast was excellent value at 20$ for 2. Parking at the hotel is 20$ a day which is about standard i feel. Other people complained of noise from trains...you can hear it but it never woke me up. Once awake you do hear it and it is loud so you may wish to ask for a room on the " view " side of the hotel. We never slept in past 0800 so there may be no noise before a certain time but you cannot miss it when it does happen. All in all i was pleased at getting this hotel for the price we paid.

<Title>“Agree on the hidden extras”
<Content>I wouldn't recommend this hotel as value for money unless you get it through Priceline which we did. It is a nice enough hotel but like someone else said - hidden money extras such as trying to con you into buying some gold card thing to get a cheaper breakfast or the other pool/spa/gym is not free. One pool is though. Great views and perfect location. Clean rooms and so-so staff. The parking starts from approx $20 a night so not cheap. There is no complimentary WiFi & it is expensive (like other big chains). Give it 3/5 for location on the plus side but lost the 2 stars for price.

The 24th floor corner room was fantastic. We had views of the bay and the city lights. The location is excellent and you can walk to many great restaurants.

<Content>My wife and I stayed at the Manchaster Grand Hyatt in June 2008 for the San Diego marathon. The lobby was impressive. Room was nicely furnished, but was filthy - there were clumps of dust and dirt under the bed and behind the night stands. Room service was mediocre and definitely not up to the standards of a AAA 4 diamond hotel. Breakfast at Lael's was pretty good, but some dinner entree items (e.g. pizza) were very poor. Staff were responsive and polite, but did nothing to remedy the poor quality food.

<Content>Manchester Hyatt is in a great location, in walking distance to the Gaslamp District, close to the ferry to Coronado, and on the waterfront near some nice restaurants. My stay was for 7 days while at a conference and it exceeded my expectations. While the hotel was pricey, it seemed as though most of their guests are business travelers ( and it is next to the convention center). The staff was wonderful and the room was spacious and clean.

<Title>“nice room, breakfast can be a painful experience though...look out basil fawlty”
<Content>stayed here for 8 days for a conference...rooms are nice, nice views of the harbour and marina from the 31st floor (got a deal on the harbour tower, 245 a night inc breakfast each day).... Talking of breakfast, if its included depending on what deal you you may get vouchers for the buffet breakfast at Laels. This can be good, or very very very frustating depending on how full the hotel is. Some days you go down there and theres a massive queue, 20 minute wait (for a buffet breakfast for pete's sake) and the staff arent communicating between themselves about what tables are free and what arent..... So its ok getting free vouchers for breakfast, but if you're customers can't use them, even better....more money in the bank.............This let the whole experience down, extremely frustating as theres a marriot right next door which is my preferred chain usually..... So basically if you want breakfast, go down early or order room service.....dont bother complaining, you're wasting your time... Not impressed....to add to the problem, mothers day they shut down the buffet breakfast room so they could charge people for a mothers day buffet brunch, excellent commercial sense as basically all the customers with free breakfast vouchers got shunted off to redfearns or whatever its called which couldnt cope with the demand and basically the whole thing was an absolute SHAMBLES................One of the front of house staff in one of the catering areas needs some attitude readjustment, i basically got told to go find out something myself instead of asking her...how nice... Why am i not awarding a terrible? The room was good, and the room service was ok, the club sandwich was excellent.......my terrible rating i save for special establishments (see other reviews)..............

I don't know if t he staff was overworked or what, but there could certainly be some improvements. First, the valet was extremely rude to us and went as far as to question if we were even guests at the hotel. Then, as we stood in line to check-in, the reception staff one by one walked away. When they finally decided to help us we were told that our room would not be ready for 2 hours. The room was nice and fairly quiet, but I did not receive any of the amenities I requested in room. Checking out was a smooth process...until we got to the valet. They charged us $56 for one night of parking. Apparently if you go one minute over 24 hours you are charged a full day of parking, which was $28 per night. They did not include this on the hotel bill. For the price of this hotel there can certainly afford to treat their guest with a little bit more respect. I was certainly not thrilled with this visit. I may give it another chance in the future.

<Title>“Consistently Great.”
<Content>I love this hotel. The location is central and provides easy access to the gaslamp quarter (dance clubs, restaurants, boutiques), East Village or ballpark district (coffee shops, bars, local eateries and unique shops), Horton Plaza shopping mall, seaport village and more. The service is impeccable. The staff is highly accommodating and seems genuinely focused on customer satisfaction. The rooms, although not huge are very comfortable and quiet. On my last three visits to the Hyatt, I have been lucky enough to stay in rooms with amazing sweeping bay views. The Top of the Hyatt bar is lovely and sophisticated, yet still low key and relaxed. The breakfast buffet at Lael's is delish! And finally, the pool is just wonderful. Plenty of lounge chairs, a simple bar, nice jacuzzi and a laid back vibe that is so characteristic of San Diego. My only two slightly negative remarks are that self parking is $20 a day and that the room service menu and quality/value could be improved. Other than that, I HIGHLY recommend the Hyatt.

<Title>“Beautiful but Lots of Extra Charges”
<Content>The Manchester Grand Hyatt is a gorgeous hotel that's very well located. It's next to Seaport Village, across the street from the trolley station and within walking distance of Gaslamp Quarter. The staff was welcoming and always helpful. The restaurants in the hotel are lovely, but a bit pricey. My only problem with the hotel is that I was charged extra for internet and gym usage. Water was stocked in the room but you'll be charged for that as well. We had to run to the grocery for water to keep in the room. All in all, it was a great experience. San Diego is a great place to visit.

<Title>“Regency Level Only Way to Go”
<Content>I was at this hotel for 4 days on business. The only way to stay at this hotel is on the Regency Level --the amenities are some of the best I've ever experienced. Free use of their computers and printer was a godsend as I hadn't brought my lap top. The lounge was a quiet bright place to work all day if I wished with an amazing view of the bay. Excellent continental breakfast, snacks all day, and delicious cocktail munchies also helped with expenses. The rooms themselves are not what rooms on that level usually are--they could use some updating--but my bed was excellent, room service was always within 30 minutes, and water pressure great. Staff very pleasant with the exception of 1 front desk guy who was rather surly--it was 6:30 am, but that shouldn't make a difference.

<Title>“Internet service not free”
<Content>Internet service is $10 a day and I was double charged - once by Hyatt on my bill and once by Hospitality Service (the internet service the Hyatt contracts with) which I only noticed when I saw the charge on my AMX account after I returned home. It was a nightmare trying to remove this "double-charged" internet service. Hyatt is not helpful - they expect you to call the Hospitality Service and try to fix this problem. When you call the Hospitality Service you are put on hold and then told that you will receive an email receipt within 48 hours which I never received and then had to call back and still never received (thinking they did this on purpose so people would give up trying to remove the charge). I wouldn't stay here again because of this experience. Another issue is that there is a train that blows its whistle in the middle of the night. Other guests told me after my stay that they received free ear-plugs from the front desk because they complained. The front desk should provide every guest with free ear-plugs upon arrival. If not, expect to get woken up.

<Title>“Nice views, poor value”
<Content>We went to a conference and were too late for $250 conference rooms. We ended up paying $400 and $500 per night, which is way more than I think the hotel is worth. Rooms were nice but unexceptional quality-wise. The lobby and pool are gorgeous, location great. Several flaws with service - too few towels and glasses. And one of the two glasses provided had toothpaste residue from the last guests. We called for 4 fresh glasses. Housekeeping came by in 15 minutes with just 2. After some explaining that we did not care to wait for the next day's cleaning to get enough clean glasses for our stay, we finally got 4 clean ones. Hotel is better suited for business & conventions than family vacations.

<Title>“I expected more from a business hotel”
<Content>Stayed at the Hyatt this month for a conference. The other reviewers are right about the spectacular view, but for the price and the clientele, I would have expected both free wi-fi and free access to the gym. The other disappointment was the trains - I know this isn't necessarily the hotel's fault, but it's located directly across the street from a well-used track that has street crossings, so it's LOUD. Woke me up every night, and because of the way the hotel is designed, I don't think there are many rooms that would escape the noise.

<Title>“Enjoyed my stay”
<Content>I stayed for 5 nights in March to attend a conference. The check-in was quick and efficient. As others have mentioned the lobby is very beautiful. There are numerous paintings, pictures of San Diego as well as photos of the various Manchester family members with prominant people spread throughout. My room was in the Seaport tower which I believe is the newer of the two. I had partial views of the bay and the city from my room. I'm sure other rooms would have a much better view. The room was clean and spacious. There were a few scuff marks and worn areas on the furnishings but otherwise everything looked nice and worked fine. I only have two complaints regarding the room. The bathroom did not have the curved shower rod. I can't remember staying in a hotel in the past few years without this feature so I felt claustrophobic when I took my shower. Perhaps other rooms in the hotel had been updated but not my room. The second complaint which many others have mentioned is the noise from the trolley/train. It is definitely noticeable in the room. I'm not a light sleeper so it did not bother me but I can see how others may have a hard time falling asleep or waking up due to the noise. I used the gym on two occasions. One of the nicer hotel gyms I've used. Not only does it have a good selection of aerobic type equipment but it also has many free weights and weight-lifting equipment as well which I rarely find in hotel gyms. The weather did not cooperate during my free time so I did not use the outdoor pool but it looked very nice. The location of the hotel is great. It's within walking distance to Seaport Village, the harbor, the convention center, the trolley station, and even the Gaslamp district. Unfortunately the hotel does not offer a free airport shuttle. I noticed that several other hotels in the area do offer free airport shuttles. Cab fare to the airport was about $11. This is definitely a business/convention hotel. There were several meetings going on while I was there, along with the accompanying crowds. Even then, I think it is family-friendly and I would enjoy staying here for vacation. I would stay here again if visiting San Diego.

<Title>“Very Nice!”
<Content>Went to the San Diego Manchester Hyatt to glom some free hotel time while my hubby was at a convention. Our 8 year old daughter came with us. This is a pretty new hotel (5 years?), and the style is very traditional/Versailles/English country manor, which normally I don't care for, but they do it well and lots of other folks love that style, so if you do, you'll love the hotel that much more. Staff was lovely except for when we initially arrived, which was late in the evening. We had been confirmed a king bed with rollaway but were told that only double bed rooms were available. A couple of stern looks and statements later, and we got a nice king room on the 19th floor with a rollaway, which was high quality rollaway, not just a cot. Unfortunately, we had to move furniture ourselves and set up the bed ourselves, but we decided better to just get it done than wait and have to tip someone else (attention hotel management!). Also, there were not enough towels nor were there robes on our arrival. A call to housekeeping resulted in delivery of robes and a mountain of extra towels within 15 minutes. The cleaners did a great job and were very sweet to us during our stay. However, a colleague staying in the other tower (Seaport) commented on a distinct lack of cleaning of her room during our stay. Our room looked out to the other tower and over the pool, and we could see the navy yards across the bay and the ocean, and also trains and trolleys. We would recommend this hotel for people with kids because there's so much transportation to see just from the windows: aircraft carriers coming and going, commuter trains, freight trains, F5s, helicopters, commercial jets, trollies, pedicabs, etc. If you have one of those kids who likes to watch things that move, this is the hotel for you! On that note, let us comment that YES, the train will wake you up in the middle of every night, always at different times!! The horn is very loud, even on the higher floors. It was only a minor nuisance for us, though, and we always fell right back to sleep. The only other weird thing about our room was a distinct lack of hot water pressure, even in the shower--I swear I haven't been in such a large hotel where you're taking a shower and the water starts to turn cold after 15 minutes. And there was almost no water pressure at all in the sink (attention hotel management again! room 1902!) Now for the amenities: gorgeous gym with 24 hour access and personal trainers onsite. There is a nice spa, though we did not partake. The pool area has 2 jacuzzis, and people seemed to be pretty considerate about monitoring kids. You can see the ocean from the pool area. The breakfast buffet is very pricey, but very comprehensive, good for a fancy Sunday brunch. For cheaper breakfast, you can go just to the courtyard outside for a starbuck's type place owned by the hotel. Even that is a bit pricey, so if you walk literally 2-3 blocks away you can find much cheaper local places. Also there's a Ralph's supermarket about a 5-10 minute walk away, so we stocked up on fruits and snacks to keep on hand. Also fun is the Top of the Hyatt bar lounge on the 40th floor, with nice panoramic views, and it's OK to bring you kids up there for a Shirley Temple while you unwind with a beer before setting out in search of dinner! Seaport Village is right next door, if you like that kind of thing, and it is nice to walk all along the harbor from the hotel up to the Midway. And if you have to be at the convention center, you walk out of the hotel, past the Marriott and there you are (< 1/2 mile). Parking is NOT included, self-park is $20 a day, valet $28 with unlimited in-out, and the valets were lovely--very helpful and it never took more than 10 minutes after a call from our room to get the car--most times it was waiting for us by the time we got out. Concierges were a bit fussy, but helpful. Our impression there is that there may not be enough of them and they may start to feel overwhelmed. Also, they will tend to only guide you the "tourist way" to destinations, but if you're like us and more adventurous, you will have to get the insider info elsewhere. Gaslamp district is 3 blocks away, Balboa Park is 2 1/2 miles.

<Title>“Corner room - what a view!!!!”
<Content>We stayed at the Hyatt for 4 nights as part of our honeymoon to california. When we first entered our room this first thing that hit us was the view - and it was pretty amazing. The full view of the bay (which the took a jet ski accross the next day) and to room itself was very spacious and modern. The location also we ideal, a short walk to the famous and busy Gaslight district with all the nightlife (the Field Irish Bar is a must!!) and nice resturaunts, Petco Park where we watched a baseball game, and also the ferry to coronado island which was a nice day trip. Not too mention that right being the hotel is the quaint seaport village with bling yachts. At $300 a night it was expensive (albiet we had a 4 for 3 deal) but for a special occasion I thought it was well worth it. Absoutley loved San Diego, couldn't recommend it enough, and hotel was a great place to stay - if you can justify the price!

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel: Business & Pleasure”
<Content>We scheduled a family reunion to celebrate a 25th birthday of our daughter...confirmed 3 rooms and were offered perfect waterfront views on the 22nd floor. The location is fantastic, right within walking/jogging areas. Seaport Village and the USS Midway were enjoyable. We had reservations at Poehe's and the Hotel's Concierge sent a lovely dessert to our table. We stayed 3 nights in March. The staff was very friendly and accomodating at all times. Self-parking was reasonable for a downtown location. I would suggest this property for an upscale pre/post cruise hotel.

<Title>“Solid not spectacular”
<Content>We would actually rate it 3.5. We stayed for two nights, booked through priceline for the downtown area. It's really a business hotel, abutting the Seaport Village and close to the convention center. If you want the gaslamp area, there are several comparable hotels that are closer. Nothing was great; nothing was awful. Beds were comfortable. For a 4 *, Room was a bit small, bathroom was clean but plain, and TV was old. We would stay again, but it wouldn't be our first choice.

<Title>“amazing view”
<Content>Stayed here for a conference and was upgraded to a corner king. The views over the san diego bay were AMAZING! My husband traveled with me and we were both facinated with all the military equipment constantly comming and going out of the harbor. I thought many things to do with the hotel were overpriced. Parking was $20 a day, internet I believe was $10. You had to pay to use the gym, pay to put stuff in your refrigerator in your room. You would think when you pay $300 a night for a room, you could get something! Anyway, the location is fantasic, it's just steps from Seaport Village which has tours running out of it so you can see more of San Diego, the USS Midway museum is within walking distance as well and the gaslamp district with all the shopping is right there as well. A rental car would probably not be necessary if you were staying here.

<Title>“Sorry, I expected more.”
<Content>The hotel itself is nice. The lobby is absolutely beautiful. I didn't see fresh flowers in the lobby. 5 * hotels must have fresh flowers to be considered 5*, which I thought this one was, but I might be wrong. Our room was okay. We were on the 25th floor, bayside view which was nice. I was disappointed in the bathroom. Nothing fancy at all. Not even the rounded shower curtain rod as lots of cheaper hotels have. It was just a regular bath tub which disappointed me. The pool is nice and has a beautiful view. There was a wedding going on and I think this would be a beautiful area to have a wedding. The other tower was nice to go into to see the view as well. Drinks were expensive so go somewhere in the Gaslamp to find cheaper drinks. Perfect location if you want to go to Seaport Village though. Right behind the hotel. I was disappointed that it closed down relatively early for a Saturday night. Valet was $28 but self parking was $20.

<Title>“Great location, nice rooms, great view”
<Content>Cost about $219 for a king bed room. Very neat. Very clean. Average room size - good for two people. Hotel was quiet, but I am sure if it is busy, the hall noise might be bothersome. BEWARE around 1-2am, the TRAIN WHISTLE/HORN is VERY LOUD. It lasts a few minutes, but it is only once during the night. It wasn't a big deal for me, I went right back to sleep, but it was quiet a surprise. Comfortable bed and pillows. Other room amenities are slightly above average. The TV is older, but who goes on vacation to watch TV? Traditional/conservative style furnishings. View was spectacular from 28th floor. Bathroom was average, but very clean. Good tioletries. Ample towels. The bathroom light is very low which was sort of pecular, but didn't really bother me. Great water pressure and temperature. Nothing fancy about the bathroom. Room was suppose to have robes, but we had to call front desk to have delivered. No big deal. Cool in-room coffee maker (pod type) even if it is average coffee. Do yourself a favor, go to the coffee shop on the boardwalk right outside the hotel at Seaport Village -- good starbucks coffe with affordable breakfast fare. Very tasty yogart granola parfait. LOVELY view on the marina. Pool area is great, but I am sure if it is very busy, it is crowded. It was virtually empty during our stay. Great views from the pool area. LOVED the fitness center. Well equipped with great views of the marina. Very peaceful. Very big hotel. Amazing lobby. Didn't try the restaurants. Top of the Hyatt has an awesome view, service was a tad slow on a Saturday night. Two drinks about $23 without tip. Romantic spot. Parking $20 a night with in and out privaleges. Location is very convenient, quality room. Definitely would stay again.

<Title>“Great conference hotel with wonderful views”
<Content>I have stayed here twice over the last year, both times for conferences. The rooms are clean and well-appointed. Free WiFi would be nice, but at least the pay system worked quite well. Room service was efficient but expensive. But frankly, the whole area within walking distance is expensive. This is really a tourist/conference district and it's tough to find food for a reasonable amount without walking 20 minutes, especially any food to go. There are quite a few restaurants nearby, though, so do walk out and experience them - you don't need to stay in the hotel to eat. The views from the hotel are amazing and the public spaces, both inside and out, are well designed and pleasant (the outdoor pool and hot-tub areas are lovely). The overall feel is of a high-end and well-run operation. Given that this is a large conference hotel, though, it would be useful to have several snack/coffee stands or cafes, rather than the one at the far north end. I found myself longing for coffee during a conference session and not having time to walk that far.

<Title>“Loved the Manchester!”
<Content>We stayed at the Manchester mid-Feb, mixing a mini-vacation with a business meeting. It's a beautiful hotel set on the San Diego Bay, next to Seaport Village. Rooms: We booked a king room thru the hotel website (2 weeks prior). Had originally planned on staying at a smaller chain, but Hyatt had a "mini-reduction in rates" so we were able to take advantage of our AAA discount . Good tip - check the specials the hotel offers (as we had buffet breakfast free with our room) and do join their Gold Passport program. Prior to arriving, we were offered Hyatt e-concierge services (we requested a quiet room with a nice view and extra pillows). WOW - they put us on the 24th floor, in a corner room for $152/night! Room was pretty standard - but the views were magnificent! Also had a window that opened for fresh air. Hotel service is outstanding throughout. Used valet parking - and car was always ready with a 5 minute notice - plus the attendants gave good directions (that were quick and precise). The fitness center is on the 4th floor with top of the line, current cardio machines, free weights, and exercise areas. Some treadmills have direct views of the bay (cool to watch cruise ships and navy helicopters coming & going). Pool area also has two jacuzzi hot tubs plus gas powered firepits, and beautiful harbor and city views. Downtown location is close to everything - plus the airport (under 10 minutes away). Printed our boarding passes in the lobby, without charge. The business conference was in the hotel - so this was a perfect choice. It's a very well run hotel that's convenient, upscale (pricey for most things), and has superior service in every aspect . Loved it!

<Title>“Great Hotel...Fantastic Location!”
<Content>Just got back from San Diego for a conference. The hotel is really as grand as it name implies. Easily the most prominenent hotel in the area. The lobby is very large and beautifully decorated in wood carvings. The rooms were average size but well decorated. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom large and modern. By far the best part of the hotel was its location. Pretty much every view from the hotel is of the bay and surrounding marina. It's conveniently located next to Seaport Village with lots of really nice dining choices right by the water. The Gaslamp district, with countless restaurants, bars, and nightclubs, is an easy walk only a few blocks away. My only complaint was of Sally's Restaurant in the hotel. Although the food is pretty good, we were troubled to see that they charge double the price for the same dishes on the dinner menu as they did on the luch menu! If you want to eat here...definately go for lunch as the same food will cost you half as much!!! Other than that, the Manchester Grand Hyatt is a beautiful hotel with a great location. Would definately stay there again!

<Title>“Great location for a relaxing weekend”
<Content>This hotel is very large, over 1600 rooms - certainly geared towards the business traveler. But the location makes it a great place to chill out for a weekend with the adjacent Seaport Village and the Gaslamp Quarter close by. I recommend the trolley tour (you can purchase tickets at the hotel and there is a trolley stop at Seaport Village) This is a hop on hop off deal that takes in a lot of what the downtown area has to offer, with Balboa Park, Old Town - it even goes over to Coronado. And, Seaport Village might be a bit "touristy", but it is a great place to people watch and spend the day. There were several street performers; a magician, a few palm readers, and even a nice woman selling home made tye-dye shirts. There are many restaurants there but Busters was the best - the fish tacos were excellent and so was their breakfasts. Back to the hotel - they did a good job at Redfields for the Super Bowl. The view from the Top of the Hyatt lounge (40th floor of the Harbor Tower) was fantastic. The pool is heated. You can walk to the cruise pier in less than 15 minutes. This is where you can take a harbor cruise or, during the winter months, take a whale-watching cruise. Also, the USS Midway is there. This was my first trip to San Diego and I only stayed two nights, but I could not have enjoyed my stay better and part of what made my short trip to San Diego great was the friendly and helpful staff as well as the location of the Grand Hyatt. I suppose it would depend on the rate one gets to determine if this hotel is a good value. I would certainly come back to San Diego and stay at this property again. If I had to find any fault with this hotel, it would be that they do not offer an airport shuttle.

<Content>The rooms are clean and neat, but doesn't meet one's expectations of a Hyatt. The beds were comfortable, and room spacious. The location is great, you can walk to Seaport for "touristy" shopping/coffee, and to downtown's Horton Plaza for a US mall experience. Restaurants are nearby, and the views from my 28th floor room was pretty good. The only drawback I found was that the furnishings and ambience of the room was a bit dated, including the carpet. The little fuzzy CRT tv was small and difficult to watch. I did enjoy the "flight check in" station with printer at the front desk, for web-checkins for flights, which terminal was conveniently located next to the checkout station that allowed your bill to be emailed to you. It was perfect accomodation for a conference but I wouldn't recommend it for a relaxing vacation stay. The pool and spa, were difficult to locate, and the restauants were average. The room service food was hardly edible.

<Title>“Pretty Nice”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel because the Omni was unavailable. The hotel is nice, but too big. It feels like a Las Vegas hotel. The location downtown is close to everything, but all in all, I would say the visit wasn't that memorable. Nothing bad, but just not wonderful. The highlight if you stay there or in San Diego is definitely the Top of the Hyatt. Day or night, the view is incredible.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>This hotel is very nice and clean. It has a great location. The staff are friendly and helpful. I loved the bed and pillows. I bought some pillows at the Hyattstore.com when I got home. I loved the location too. You can walk a lot of places.

<Title>“Noisy, expensive, but we loved it!”
<Content>We stayed there while husband attended a business meeting. Loved the location, loved the service, loved the rooms. The restaurants were always packed, so we ate off-site most of the time , but excellent restaurants were right out the side door in Seaport Village. Spent a lot of time in Seaport Village, which almost seemed like part of the hotel. I was alarmed after a lovely afternoon at the spa, getting a manicure, pedicure, set me back $175.00. However, everyone was so nice, and so attentive. What did I expect? The only other annoyance was the darned trolley clanging its darned bell in the middle of the darned night!

<Title>“Great!!!”
<Content>I really enjoyed the stay. First they gave me a big discount due to the fact they couldn't get me smoking room. It was New Years Eve and they told EVERYONE that check out was time was 2 pm. I was so happy, because I had a long night. Everything was great, from the bathrooms, the bed and the breakfast. I'm doing the same next year!

<Title>“Almost Too Big”
<Content>We were going to be in SD for a few days to visit with family and I thought I would try Priceline. I got the Manchester Hyatt for $100 a night. Not that much lower that the lowest rate on the Hyatt website but with parking at $20/day, I thought $120 was better than $170. We had a room on the 25th floor. I didn't hear the trains but my husband did and it bothered him at times. The room was tiny for the four of us (w/kids 5 & 13) but clean. I didn't like the deodorizer that they sprayed all over the place and it was a hike to get anywhere around the hotel. There were a lot of people there - including the Univ. of Texas football team but it never felt like it was crowded. We liked the proximity to Seaport Village and ate there a few times. We also walked a few blocks to Horton Plaza - a nice mall. It was a nice walk after being in the car for 3 hours. I liked having what we needed nearby but I'd think I'd like to try a smaller hotel next time.

<Title>“Great Hotel. Perfect Location”
<Content>The Manchester Hyatt is a lovely Hotel. No complaints. The service was excellent and the location was perfect. It was only a short 5-10 minute drive to Sea World and The San Diego Zoo. The Hotel is also right next to Seaport Village which has many restaurants and shoppes. We had a corner room with great views of the bay and the city skyline. Awesome views! We would definitely stay there again.

<Title>“Convenient location, good service, great pillows, some noise at night”
<Content>This two-tower hotel has very comfortable rooms. The bed and pillows are wonderful. After traveling in the Orient for 4 weeks, I thought that Asian service was the best. But, this hotel pretty much matched Asia for superior service. The concierge service is the best I have ever found. This hotel is very suitable for business travel. The only negative was that our room 3602 was RIGHT NEXT TO THE METAL STAIR WELL that the night watchman banged down every few hours during the night. We were in the 40 floor tower, so I would avoid any room ending in 02 in that tower. We complained and the hotel made an accommodation to fix the situation. But if you don't want the hassle of moving, make sure that you don't get near the stair well. Oh, the other negative is that the trains sound a horn in the middle of the night from time to time. (Bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.) These trains affect ALL hotels that are in this harbor/ waterfront area, so there is not much you can do to avoid it if you need to be near the convention center. The breakfast buffet was so great, that we actually tried that restaurant for dinner one night. oops... that did not work out. While they do a great breakfast, somehow, the dinner menu does not work out at all. Overall, a very good business hotel. Stayed here 7 nights for a business conference. There is none of that useless "turn-down" sevice at night, so there is not that extra intrusion into the room at night (a welcome relief.)

<Title>“Near the convention center, Gaslamp, and that @#$% train”
<Content>Stayed at the Hyatt while attending a conference. Good news: The hotel is clean, housekeeping got it right every time, reservations weren't screwed up. The location is very convenient to the Convention Center, the Gaslamp district, the Midway aircraft carrier museum, and the Marriott. There is a safe but no refrigerator. A supermarket (Ralph's) is within walking distance. Bad news: Food provided by catering was nothing special, though maybe the cheap stuff was ordered. The bar at the top of the hotel is disappointing. The windows aren't big and are designed to prevent you from looking out while sitting in the low chairs that are near the windows. The train whistle is relentless, though the HVAC unit's fan can be put on high, masking much of the noise. This is an above average conference hotel but if your conference uses the US Grant hotel for overflow, let them put you there. The location is better for your time off and that hotel is rated higher by this web site. Maybe it's my age, but it was just weird seeing how many Japanese tourists were smiling and taking pictures of each other in front of the Midway on December 7 (Pearl Harbor anniversary). I'm glad that times have changed.

<Title>“Great hotel in a great location.”
<Content>I have been staying at the Hyatt Manchester for years, back when it was one tower and now in its remodeled glory and I have never had an experience that I would consider "bad." When something has not been to my liking, the staff has in most instances been very accomodating. To see ratings of 1 and 2 for this hotel is just hard for me to imagine. Nevertheless, it just goes to show that different people have different experiences and probably handle those experiences differently. By the way, the hotel is in a great location and has a first rate health club.

<Title>“No problems at all”
<Content>I stayed here for 4 nights for a convention,a little wary because of some of the reviews that I read here. I must have been lucky, because I have no complaints - and I am a fussy guest. From check-in onwards, everything was efficient and smooth. I stayed on the 8th floor in a room which was large enough and very comfortable, with a great bed. Room service delivery was especially fast and friendly, as was the laundry service. The elevators, although full of delegates, were not unduly slow. My room had a beautiful view of the pool and harbor beyond. There was no noise from other rooms, nor did I hear the trains which run nearby. One night we had snacks in the lobby bar, which were delicious - ahi tuna, cooked just right, and flatbread pizza. It was better than the food in the restaurant where we went for dinner. Great location for either Seaport Village or the Gaslamp district, and about 10mins walk from the convention centre. Overall, hard to get any better. One of my fellow delegates was bitten by bed bugs at his hotel!

<Title>“Great location, amenities and service, but...”
<Content>I recently stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt, San Diego for 10 nights. The first six nights were for a convention, and then I extended my stay for a vacation. This hotel is in a great location with beautiful views of the bay and marinas and within walking distance of Seaport Village (parks, music, affordable eateries), downtown’s famous Gaslamp District, the Midway (retired aircraft carrier – open to the public), and a short ferry ride to Coronado Island. It’s also located a reasonably short taxi ride away from Balboa Park and the San Diego Zoo (both of which, I recommend highly). The Hyatt’s entrance is “grand” and the lobby and restaurants/bars contained therein are all beautiful and immaculate. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same about the rooms. The hotel hallways, rooms and room décor/furnishings are about the same size and quality as a roadside Comfort Inn or Hampton Inn (the exception was that the bed and bedding were very comfortable). In addition, the room’s walls and windows are paper thin, and as a result, the sound of slamming doors, running water, televisions, conversations, hallway traffic, outdoor trains and automobile traffic were ubiquitous. I also want to add that I felt that I was being nickled and dimed by this hotel. I'm used to using a long distance access card (toll-free number) for free, but the Hyatt charges $1.00 per call. In addition, they charge $9.95 for each 24 hour connection to the internet. With regard to the room service, the unusually limited selection was not just overpriced (like most hotels), but ridiculously overpriced...especially when you add the $3.00 delivery charge and the required 21 percent gratuity to the price of the meal. For example, after all was said and done, my waffle and cranberry juice breakfast cost just over $29.00. And, with regard to laundry, getting my suitcase-wrinkled shirts pressed cost $7.75 each. With regard to the service, I will say that each Hyatt employee I dealt with was earnest and kind. There were a few problems for which the hotel personnel bent over backwards to remedy – which in the end, they did. However, I don’t want to overstate these problems. For every issue I had, the Hyatt did 100 things right. So to summarize…great location, amenities and service, but the rooms themselves left a bit to be desired and the incidental charges were a bit insulting--especially when you consider the nightly rates.

<Title>“One major flaw”
<Content>I booked the Manchester Hyatt for a conference that was being held there. They gave me a corner room that was spacious and well appointed. The room, furniture, bed and bathroom were all top notch.. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful at every encounter. The hotel, although huge, is laid out well and I enjoyed the pool. (Hint- even though they don't have a pool bar open, you can order room service to bring you drinks up on the pool deck.) Room service was overpriced but I'm not sure when/where it's not. Sounds good overall, except for one thing...... It's darn near impossible to get any sleep there due to noise! The hotel has the unfortunate location of being directly next to train tracks. The trains blast their horn as a warning for the pedestrian crossing that they traverse. What this means is that every hour or so throughout the night there's a ridiculously loud train horn blasting into the room (even in rooms on the upper floors where I was.). It was so ridiculous that it was comical at first, however upon not being able to sleep it got really old, really fast. (I definitely wouldn't consider myself a light sleeper.) The hotel windows are cheap, thin, single-pane construction. I'd imagine if the hotel were to sink money into nicely constructed double-pane windows the noise would be diminished by quite a bit. They've chosen not to however and the guests are left to deal with this. After the first night of noise I asked the concierge where I could buy some earplugs. Without hesitation she reached into a drawer and pulled some out. I'm fairly certain that this a frequent request and one that Hyatt should be a bit embarrassed about. Until they pony up for some new windows, I'd strongly encourage light to normal sleepers to either avoid this place or pack some earplugs.

<Title>“Totally misses the mark”
<Content>This place looks nice from the street and in the lobby, but the rooms leave plenty to be desired. I checked in, requested a non smoking room and got a non smoking room that smelled like an ashtray. Went back to the lobby to get another room and was told that smoking had been allowed many years ago on that floor but had since been designated for non. Staff didn't hesitate to change my room, but put me on a low floor with a view of a rooftop littered with garbage and only a sliver of skyline. None of this is a big deal to me since I'm only here for a convention and thus hardly ever in the room except to sleep, which is also where this hotel fails me and the reason I'll be checking out early. On a Sunday morning at 8:05 AM, I got a knock from housekeeping to clean the room. Suppose I should have used the privacy sign, but didn't think I would have to refuse housekeeping so early on a weekend. Now, as I write this, it's 4:00 AM and I've barely slept a wink thanks to slamming doors in the hallways, which I had assumed was coming from another guest but actually was caused by inconsiderate engineering staff going in and out of a boiler/AC room at the end of the hall. Called the front desk to report this, got an apology and a promise to address the problem, but it continues. Two days left in this convention, and I'm already very tired. I'd ask for another room here, but I'm afraid of what would await me. I'll be checking out instead.

<Title>“Couldn't have asked for a better stay”
<Content>I stayed at the Manchester for 6 days-4 days for a conference that was held at the hotel and 2 days for sight seeing prior to the conference. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and can't for the life of me understand the negativity of some of the other reviewers. This hotel is beautiful! Check in was very efficient. I arrived at noon and was given a room without any problem, even though it was several hours before stated check in. I requested a room in the Seaport tower with a bay view and was not charged extra for this. What a fantastic view of the bay and the ships passing by! One window does actually open, which was great because I love fresh air. However, it's very noisy at night and had to close it over night....trains, horns! The walls must be pretty thin because I could hear jazz music blaring from the room next door which kept me from falling asleep one night. I called the desk and within 15 minutes the music had stopped. The rooms have been recently renovated- comfy pillow top bedding with lots of pillows, new carpeting...very clean. The rooms have an ipod docking station/alarm clock, which I thought was wonderful. Housekeeping was very efficient and our room was made up daily. I ordered room service for breakfast twice and was delighted each time. Pricey with a $3 delivery charge and a 21% room service charge (including tip) but it was very convenient and delicious. The food was a great temperature and received within a half hour of placing the order both times. They even delivered one morning to the 4th floor pool deck where I was enjoying the beautiful San Diego weather. I also had brunch in the hotel restaurant, which was very good. They have a fantastic buffet with omelets made to order. The rest of the meals we had outside of the hotel. There are many casual dining restaurants within an easy walking distance, especially in the Seaport village located directly behind the hotel. There is everything from order-at-the-window tacos and margaritas, hot dogs, etc. to fine sit down dining overlooking the bay. We had a really nice dinner at the Harbor House in the Seaport village, which is right on the boardwalk by the bay. Expensive, everything is ala carte, but very good. Our favorite restaurant was Anthony's, located between the Midway and the Star of India on the boardwalk. I had the Sea Bass one night and the California spiny lobster another night...salad, bread and side included for under $30. I didn't see prices like this anywhere else in the gas lamp or Seaport Village. I did not rent a car and would not recommend doing so unless you need it to travel outside of the city. Everything worth seeing is within a few miles. Taxis are always readily available at the front of the hotel with reasonable fares. Taxi fare one way from the airport was $12. I understand there was a daily charge of $20 for parking a car. The shops at the Seaport Village were fantastic, also good shopping at the Horton Plaza. I liked Seaport Village because the shops were so unique. Horton Plaza had stores that you see in any mall. I really enjoyed just walking up and down the boardwalk. A lot of activity with T-shirt and jewelry vendors, there were several cruise ships that were docked while we were there. Lots of military ships passing and the navy seals were always active. My only complaint was the large number of homeless people that literally littered the beautiful park areas adjacent to the boardwalk. It would have been nice to sit on the benches for a while and watch the boats float by on the bay, but couldn't. Another reader said they were not approached by them, I was twice. I have to say it was very creepy walking down here at night, I wouldn't recommend it. My Mom took a tour of the Midway while I was at my conference and she really enjoyed it. I would also highly recommend the Trolley Tour. Tickets are $30 and available at any of the trolley stops (one in Seaport Village). The tour is 2 hours if you don't get off and is fully narrated. There are stops at the Zoo, the museum district, the cruise ship terminal, Old Town and Coronado Island. We got off in Old Town, which had a lot of shopping and had a great lunch at Baja Rockin' Lobster. We also got off in Coronado Island which had great shopping as well and went through the hotel Del Coronado. We went through the back of the hotel and sat on the beautiful white sand beach and watched the Pacific surf. I was told the sunset from there was out of this world. I spent a lot of time on the 4th floor pool area, which was beautiful. Decent sized pool, 2 hot tubs and cushioned lounge chairs. Chairs were hard to come by at midday, but available. There were beautiful views of down town San Diego and the Bay from up here. There was not anywhere to get food or drinks by the pool but there were phones where you could call to have something delivered. In fact the only place where you could get a bottle of water or a soft drink was in the gift shop in the Harbor Tower. There are no beverage machines located anywhere in the hotel. I would also highly recommend going to the 40th floor of the Harbor Tower and have a drink at the Top of the Hyatt. The views here were fantastic! Don't hesitate to stay here, the location is perfect, the hotel is beautiful and the service was excellent. You won't be disappointed!

<Title>“Pleasant stay, but misses the mark”
<Content>I've stayed at this hotel many times. Including one stay before they remodeled a few years ago. Earlier this year, I found the hotel to be very nice. But on a trip this month, I felt it was slipping a bit much like the days before the remodel. This hotel is perfectly fine for a business stay, but for those looking for a getaway, you may want to consider elsewhere. Here are some things to know: Arrival and Front Desk - All of the staff was pleasant and efficient. I could overhear all of the front desk staff giving the same sales pitch to upgrade rooms "for only $20 additional dollars a night", this was in response to the fact that all of us requested king beds but could only be given doubles. The person who helped me gave me room keys, but forgot to have them coded for my room so they didn't work. She also forgot to give me a key to the mini bar, so I called down for it later. Rooms -- Beds are well appointed with new linens, down comforter, etc. However the room had several little things wrong with it - the internet connection did not work and the outlets by the desk did not work consistently, so I had to sit on the bed and plug in there. They do not provide robes at this hotel, which I still don't understand. I requested one and received a very shabby and stained robe. It had nail polish all over the front of it. A robe isn't a necessity for everyone, but it is standard at any 4 and most 3-star hotels. The hairdryer worked, but the switch was broken, so you had to jiggle it for the dryer to come on. The bathroom was clean, but the grout is very stained and needs redone and sealed in black so that it doesn't appear so dirty (in this case it ws white grout around the edges of the room that slowly darkened to black where a person stands at the sink) I reported the electrical issues, but they weren't able to fix them during my stay. Fitness Center - The Fitness Center could be outstanding, but everyone I spoke to agreed it misses the mark. It's open 24 hours which is excellent, but there is only about a 10x10 space to do any stretching or ab work. There are TV monitors set up at each cardio machine, but they did not work. Every day the attendant would say "they are being installed tonight" but the next day it was just the same condition. What made this worse is that the machines faced windows which overlooked the bay, but due to the 17 inch blank screen in front of you, you couldn't enjoy the view. Restaurants - Here is where they Hyatt has done well. They have a variety of restaurants and lounges to choose from and they are all good quality with a variety of options. Sally's is a nice spot that feels separate from the hotel, even though it's not. All in all, this is still one of the better Hyatts, but I think they need to stay dedicated to keeping the rooms in good shape and aim to make the room amenities features of the room instead of detractors. Great for 2 nights, but probably not to impress anyone.

<Title>“Prime Location”
<Content>I stayed at the Hyatt Manchester Grand for one night prior to a cruise. This property is wonderful, the lobby is very impressive. The hotel is huge there are two towers. I was checked in in about 2 minutes. The front desk staff is quick and extremely friendly and accurate. The hotel offers everything a roof top pool, a full service spa, meeting rooms, dining, exercise room, etc...My room was clean and had excellent amenities. If you would like a great view pay a little extra for a bay view it is so beautiful. This hotel is in a prime location close to everything in the city such as the pier, San Diego Airport is about 3 miles, and Seaport Village is right outside the side door. The hotel does have valet and self parking I did the self parking for $20.00 per day. I will definitely return to this hotel if I am in San Diego. Once again Hyatt has exceeded my expectations.

<Title>“Massive hotel complex with good features.”
<Content>Stayed at the Grand Hyatt in San Diego for 3 nights. The complex itself is huge and definitely caters more to the business/convention crowd. Got upgraded to a corner room with amazing views of both the island and marinas. Too cold to enjoy during our visit but the pool and spa were nice touches with outdoor fireplaces. Check out Beach Bar on the top floor of the W for a great place to grab a cocktail.

<Title>“Truly grand”
<Content>Let me say first of all that I don't typically stay in luxury hotels, but my husband and I got the Manchester Grand Hyatt through Priceline for $120/night plus taxes. At that price, what a deal for a fabulous hotel! The location is great, right in Seaport Village (yes, it's a tourist trap, but very pretty), with a stop for the San Diego trolley a short walk from the entrance. (We did not have a car for our stay and got along fine using public transportation.) The hotel is very impressive - the reception area reminded me of a grand train station from older days, and all the common areas are luxurious as well. Service was fine; we had to wait in line a few minutes but the front desk staff was friendly. Our room was large and very clean, the bed was comfortable with a firm mattress and the nicest sheets I've ever slept on in a hotel. Bathroom was fine; not the largest but sparkling clean and recently renovated. Our room on a lower floor in the Seaport Tower had a nice view of the small park in front of the hotel and the harbor. We especially enjoyed using the pool on the large fourth floor deck, which had a great view, two whirlpools, and plenty of comfortable lounge chairs. The only complaints are minor - it's a big, busy hotel, with lots of people buzzing around the common areas (lots of convention attendees when we were there), and a semi-confusing layout. We got on the wrong elevator at first, and I did a fair amount of wandering around trying to find the pool, coffee shop, etc. Hardly a big deal, though. Also, the parking fee seemed ridiculous - $21/night - and they don't offer a free shuttle from the airport (it cost $7 per person for a shuttle one-way, BTW). All in all, we had a wonderful stay and would recommend the hotel for anyone wanting a luxurious stay at a convenient spot to see the sights in San Diego.

<Title>“Not as nice as the name suggests”
<Content>If you book directly through the hotel, this review may not be applicable... hopefully. I stayed at Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego for one night, and I'm just glad my stay wasn't for longer duration as originally planned. The reception staff at check in was very cold and unreceptive. Unexplained long wait and no response when I asked what the problem was. Also the room rate included complimentary breakfast, but he said he didn't know anything about it and told us to come back later for vouchers. The vouchers we eventually got ended up being pretty much useless anyways because the lines at the restaurant were over an hour long. The real problem started when I asked Housekeeping to bring me a set of towels and other customary hospitality items for an extra (paid) guest. What I received were two tightly stacked water glasses that could not be separated and two bath towels in one of which I later found a stranger's p*b*c hair. When I called Housekeeping to complain about the hair in the towel, the operator hung up on me mid-sentence and didn't pick up the phone on my second attempt. I was able to reach Housekeeping a few minutes later. Shortly thereafter, there was a loud knock on the door- it was a maid asking what time we'll be checking out. It was barely 10AM at this time, and the stated check-out time was 12 Noon (we had already had another maid knocking only an hour earlier at which time we discovered the room didn't have a do-not-disturb sign). We figured things could go only worse and decided to leave the premises immediately, especially because my brother, who had just come back after having tried to get some breakfast and getting tired of endless waiting, just wanted to go somewhere to eat in peace. On the way out, a hotel personnel who showed me the location of express check-out asked me how my stay was. So prompted, I briefly mentioned the hair in the towel and being driven out by the hourly visits by the maids. He was horrified by these events that "should never have happened" and insisted that I wait to speak with a manager. However, when an assistant manager saw me, the tune changed immediately. The assistant manager said, although Hyatt guests would normally be compensated for the type of experience we were subjected to, there was really nothing he could do and advised me to speak with Expedia- "people who book through third parties are not Hyatt guests," according to him. No, sympathy, no apologies, and no assurances of following up with housekeeping! Only after I became loud and belligerent upon being incited by his comment, did this assistant manager remember to apologize for my experience. So although the location was convenient, guest room was nicely furnished, and the beds and bedding were the best, I probably would never go back to this place. The Marriott next door actually has better access to Seaport Village.

<Title>“great experience”
<Content>We stayed at the Hyatt on Sept.15,2007 for one night. We had a great experience. Since the moment we registered, we were treated very well. We were given vouchers for breakfast at the Lael's restaurant. The price for the buffet would have been 22.00 per person. The food at the buffet was great. They had all the basics plus lots of healthy alternatives such as cereals, oatmeal, and assorted nuts and fruits. The service was excellent. The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable. We were upgraded to a room with view of the marina and the city, including Petco Park. My daughter and I swam in the pool at 9:00 pm and the water was still warm. It's shallow and clean. The pool area is huge and comfortable. We walked out of the hotel from the back door and entered the marina shopping area. There are several restaurants and shops to spend all day walking around. The gaslamp district is within walking distance (a few blocks north of the hotel). This hotel is probably within 15 minutes by car of all major attractions. As mentioned before, I have stayed here before and enjoyed it every time. I got a great deal through priceline.com p.s. be ready to pay 20.00 for parking per day. It seems high but it's standard price for any decent hotel in San Diego. Stay here, you will not disappointed. If you are have never been to S.D., make sure you visit old town and try their homemade tortillas. The food in most restaurants is decent.

<Title>“Good Deal at the Hyatt”
<Content>The Grand Hyatt is a great option near the pier in San Diego. It is within walking distance to the Gaslamp, as well as to the waterfront. The rooms were fine - nothing special, but the mattresses were comfortable and everything was clean. One negative was we asked for an ocean view, and had to pay $20/night extra. When we got to the room, however, it was more of a pool view. We shouldn't have spent the extra money, because if we stayed in our original room, we probably would have ended up with the same view anyway. I would definitely not pay full price for this hotel, but there are great deals on Hotwire and Priceline that make a stay here very reasonable.

<Title>“Superb customer service in an intelligent setting”
<Content>Our daughter was married in San Diego, though not at the Hyatt .But, we had 175 guests stay at the Grand Hyatt. We also had a welcome dinner and a farewell brunch, as well as a hospitality suite there. From the moment we walked into the hotel until the day we checked-out, we were treated like royalty. The catering and reservations people were fabulous to work with, and even endeared themselves to us to the extent that we feel as though we made good friends! Every hotel employee seems trainmed to give their guests First Class service. All of our out-of-towners commented on this. Not only is the hotel beautiful, but the place truely exudes friendliness We will try to stay there every time we visit San Diego. It's a five star place in our book !.

<Title>“Great hotel and city”
<Content>I stayed at the Manchester Grand the week before Labor Day. The hotel is huge and is in a great spot. It's on the bay across from Coronado Island. The rooms were very comfortable and big enough for 3 people to move around in. The bathroom also was a bit bigger, with a separate cupboard to put your toiletries in (rather than bunching them up near the sink). The bedding was wonderful! It was a down comforter and pillows so soft that I'm going to order some for my home. the staff here was extremely nice and helpful in giving you directions, helping you get a cab, etc. the poolside area on the 4th floor was huge, with a lot of lawn furniture, cabanas, a bar, restaurant, children's area where they could get toys, fire pits and foosball and ping pong tables. given that it was a huge hotel, the pool area was always crowded. a nice size margarita by the pool was $9 -- about what i expected. the workout room, which overlooks the ocean, is also on the 4th floor near the pool. the equipment was a bit older but it did the trick. they provided dry towels and cold wet towels for guests and a water cooler. they were supposed to charge for using the fitness room, but no one was ever there to take my name, so i didn't pay. out behind the hotel is Seaport Village, which is a bunch of restaurants and shops along the boardwalk and next to the park. it's a nice place to shop and eat. plenty of variety. the park and boardwalk are also nice to walk and run in in the mornings. In the summer, they have orchestra concerts by the water. it's only $12 for lawn seats. That's also where you'll find a lot of the tours of the city to sign up for. we went into the Maritime Museum on the aircraft carrier. I'm not a big military buff, but I thought it was pretty cool and worth the $15 entry fee. The Gaslamp district of shops, bars and restaurants is a short walk. that's a pretty cool place to go too. It's also by the regular mall, which wasn't all that impressive. it looks a lot bigger than it actually is. There's a place in there (Rocco's maybe?) where you can get a manicure and pedicure for $30 total! granted it's not the luxurious spa experience but, if you're looking just to pamper your feet and hands for a while, it's not bad. that service is $95 at the Hyatt's spa. I would skip Old Town unless you're looking to kill some time. It was just a bunch of the same shops you can see in Seaport Village but in an old town setting. One of the locals told us Old Town is under new management who isn't taking care of it and it might shut down anyway. We also took a trip to Ensenada, Mexico. It was ok. Our tour guide/bus driver wasn't that good, so we didn't learn much about the areas we went through. However, my aunt took the same trip 2 years ago and loved it. She said her tour guide was great that time. So I guess it's a coin toss. We took the pedicabs a few times too. Those are fun but they're looking to rip off tourists. Don't pay more than $10 for a ride. We found that when one person told us it was $20, another would come up and ask us what we wanted to pay. We never paid over $10. There are a lot of homeless people in San Diego and many line the boardwalk outside Seaport Village. They never said anything though and seemed harmless. In all, we loved San Diego and the Manchester Grand and would recommend it.

<Title>“4-star hotel with 1-star guest rooms”
<Content>I spent a week here in Aug 2007 for a conference. The hotel is great, 4-stars everywhere except the guest rooms. The guest rooms are strictly 1 or 2 stars. First big complaint, they use double beds. That's right, the domain of Motel 6 in a $200-300 room. I had a reservation for a king non-smoking. Even though I arrive a day before most of the convention goers, they told me sorry, but we have no king beds available. Second big complaint, very noisy AC unit in the window. Once again, it reminds me of a cheap motel. Third, small complaint, sub-standard bathroom. Tile, not marble. Plain basic shower and enameled tub. Small, rough and coarse towels. Outside the guest rooms this place is great. But the rooms were so unpleasant that I don't intend to return. Next time they hold a conference here, I'll stay next door at Embassy Suites or the Marriott. The guest rooms can't be worse. Especially for this kind of money. I gave this place a rating of 2 because of the hotel outside the guest rooms.

<Title>“Another Great Experience + Travel Duck Tips”
<Content>We recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Diego for the second time and had a great experience. Let's get right to the Travel Duck tips: 1. There are two towers - the Seaport Tower (built 2004) and Harbor Tower (built 1992). I have stayed in both towers and highly recommend the newer Seaport Tower. The front desk person was very helpful in finding us a room with a great view in the Seaport Tower. 2. The hotel charges $20/day for self park and $28/day for valet. Self Park is a pain as you have to go to at least the third level to find a spot. I would choose valet next time for the extra few bucks a day. 3. In San Diego, you must have a "fish taco." I recommend Baja Rockin Lobster in the GasLamp district on 5th Street. 4. For the best breakfast in San Diego, try Kona's on Pacific Beach at the Pier. The line is long but moves quick. and you will be full all morning. 5. There are often long lines at the hotel upon check in. However, if you are a Gold Passport member you can go to a special line - saves precious beach time. 6. You can walk from the hotel to Gas Lamp district (10 minutes); Petco Park (15 minutes); or Seaport Village (2 minutes). You can also take a bicycle cab - no need to call one since 20 of them will harass you when you leave the front door. 7. The hotel pool is very nice but it was tough to find a chair. Get there early. And, to the nice gentleman smoking a cigar which blew all over the pool area - I suggest the Cigar Bar in Gas Lamp Quarter. 8. I found the bellman from Baltimore (forgot his name) very helpful - he even printed me out directions to In and Out Burger. All the staff were very pleasant. 9. Are you still reading? Aren't you bored yet? If you want more San Diego tips feel free to ask. TD

<Title>“Great location by the water. Can walk to Gaslamp!”
<Content>The location for the Grand Hyatt was great. We had a room overlooking the marina and spa pool. Seaport Village is right outside the hotel, so there are no worries about parking if you park at the hotel garage (expensive, but in/out privileges handy). The regular room we were in looked to be recently remodeled, at least where bedding and furniture was. The bathroom needed some help, especially the toilet, as the one in there was way beyond its useful life. It looked ok, but flushed horribly and it took over a half hour for the tank to fill. The people that worked there were very friendly, especially at the concierge desk. There was always a line but they pushed it through quickly so the wait was not long. The cleaning people mostly kept to themselves and were slow. We came back to our room at 4 pm and it still was not made up. I saw one of the ladies who cleans rooms on that floor and just asked her for more towels and shampoo because I ended making the bed myself. She did not speak English so I just pointed to what I wanted on her cart. She was nice and smiled a lot. Her smile was catchy! She was probably happy that she didn't need to do our room, but at least she understood English. When we got back each evening from the Gaslamp District, we had "movie night" in our room through the hotel's television. Movies are cheap - cheaper than going to a theater. Room service is excellent (as I've found typical in Hyatts) and we watched movies at night to wind down from our busy day. I love how you can pause a movie in case you need to answer the door (when midnight snacks are delivered). It rewinds about the last 10 seconds so you do not miss anything. Hyatt's movies are latest releases too, some not yet available on DVD. Gaslamp District is within walking distance, maybe a 15 minute walk. The Gaslamp website includes this Hyatt in their list of hotels, which is a bit deceiving for someone not used to walking. The concierge suggested cabbing it instead of walking it. We cabbed it there to meet our reservation times one day, but walked back. The great thing is the safety factor. The area is well lit and feels very safe. Certain streets are very crowded and you can tell that food is the main reason people go there. So many restaurants and bars compared to shopping places. We spent many hours walking around at night. Overall a pleasant experience at the Hyatt. Not the best, but good nonetheless. I would have no problems staying here again.

<Title>“Average Hotel, Great Location”
<Content>Stayed here for a convention March 2007. Check in was late and didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped, indeed, they didn't have a room for me one night even though I had confirmation, eventually sorted. Great location on the waterfront, easy to walk to downtown attractions and great views particularly if you have a sea view room. The Seaport village is literally right at the back of the hotel with plenty of options for casual eating. Had a business plan room, other than inclusive breakfast appeared pretty standard compared to other rooms, very functional, no complaints. The hotel is very large so if you are after an initimate experience find somewhere else, it does feel a bit impersonnal. Very large lobby with a few shops and bars. Breakfast could take some time with everyone attending conferences all turning up at same time. Gym is small but has most amenities although extra cost. Two pools areas, one included and one part of spa experience that has additional cost. The pool are is large with plenty of seating although when I stayed the wind did seem to cut right across the pool area everyday making it quite chilly. The hotel is decidely average but the location and views are great.

<Title>“So, So experience”
<Content>I guess I was expecting more from the Grand Hyatt name. We arrived at the hotel at 1145pm due to a delayed flight. There were 3 reps checking in guests with 3 guests in line. 20 minutes later we checked in got our keys and went up to the room. The keys failed to work. I tried calling from the white phone near the elevator but the phone just kept ringing. I went back down to the front desk and was told I had to wait in line to get a new key. 30 minutes later with new keys in hand I went back to the 31rst floor room - the keys failed to work again. I went down to the front desk once more only to be told I had to wait in line....15 minutes later the fellow who checked me in stated they had trouble with the keys all day - some computer glitch....they gave me a new room between two elevators... the noise was loud but bearable - I was tired and hungry...Room service would be better I thought...wrong...I kid you not but it took a full 10 minutes of ringing to get room service on the line. They stated it would take 30 minutes - I was starving so relented. An hour later they called and said they were running late and would be up in five minutes. 2 cans of room temp. Sprite with no glasses or ice, 2 decent club sandwiches, and 2 inedible salads later we went to bed. This is a large convention type hotel. Expect long lines waiting for the breakfast buffet at "Laels" which turned out to be very good. The hotel concierge's were very helpful and getting taxis was a cinch. Seaport Village is behind the hotel with good places to eat and downtown is a short walk. A must see is the Maritime Museum a 10 minute walk from the hotel.

<Title>“Great stay”
<Content>The way to judge great service is when things go wrong. We arrived late on a busy Saturday night and they had no non-smoking rooms available. They offered to bazooka a smoking room but it would take an hour to do. I asked if they could do anything else for us. They offered a room that was part of a suite. It had a Murphy bed and they brought a rollaway in for my son. The next day they would move our luggage into a non-smoking room. When I asked if there was anything they could do to make up for the inconvenience they offered us breakfast at the hotel buffet. We accepted and the room was very nice if not the normal hotel room. The hotel is in a great location with many of the downtown attractions a short walk away. I would highly recommend this hotel to any traveler, business or pleasure.

<Title>“stay somewhere else”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatta over the weekend for a conference. On Friday night we wanted to go to the Top of the Hyatt lounge on the 40th floor, which supposedly had great views. We were asked to show ID, although the greeter did not ask ID for the couple who entered just before us. I had a Massachsuetts driver's license, and my husband had a French passport. This is where it got interesting. The greeter said that he could let me in but could not accept the foreign passport because it did not include weight, a required a physical descriptive according to California law. We responded that the Massachusetts license didn't list weight either and that didn't seem to be a problem for him, and he basically said "well, I've seen those licenses before and I know where that's coming from." There were a number of things that disturbed us about this experience. It seemed ridiculous that a French passport is valid to get past customs and into the country but apparently not into the Top of the Hyatt lounge. The provincial attitude of the greeter was insulting and in striking contrast to the Hyatt's self-promoted image as a world-class hotel. It also was evident that the policy was being applied unfairly and arbitrarily -- we wouldn't have had a problem if the greeter checked ID on everyone, but he clearly was picking and choosing to be difficult with us. We did complain to the manager who apologized for the experience. We later found 2 small bottles of Evian and 3 chocolate-covered strawberries delivered to our room. On Saturday, we stopped briefly at our room at 6pm to find that it had not been cleaned. We went out for dinner, and upon our return at 10:30 pm found it still had not been cleaned. We could not wait to leave on Sunday. The Hyatt has a nice pool, good location, and great view, but so do many of the hotels nearby. Why stay at a place where you obviously are just a means to make a buck?

<Title>“Great Views - Pricey Hotel”
<Content>We stayed at the Hyatt for a weekend in early August. We did not have a car and found the hotel's downtowns location to be good for walking to all downtown attractions. However, if you needed a vehicle for other San Diego attractions (zoo, Sea World etc) the parking rates at the hotel are high. In general, all of the hotel's amenities (food, drinks, parking, exercise room) are expensive. We stayed in the new tower in one of the smaller suites on the 30th floor. The room was a little larger than an average hotel room but was very clean and had floor-to-ceiling windows with a view of downtown and a slight bay view. The view at night was quite impressive. The overall size of the hotel (two towers that are both 30-plus floors) will make for a busy stay (pool was packed, bar was full etc) but we didn't feel that the crowds actually detracted from our stay. We were able to walk to the San Diego Padres Petco Park and to all of our meals downtown. Cabs were staged right outside for additional transportation needs. The hotel did not have an airport shuttle (a bit of a surprise) and the cab fare is about $10 to the airport.

<Title>“Beware of Bedbugs”
<Content>In attending a recent conference, I had to stay at the Manchester Grand Hyatt. Overall, despite being an enormous cavernous hotel with multiple convenstions going at any time, the hotel was not bad. However, after 3 nights' stay, I checked out with multiple bug bites on my extremities - hands, arms, legs, etc. Yes, bed bugs...I had a bad feeling when I checked in and saw the exposed mattress (topsheet was not fitted nor big enough to cover the mattress) and didn't even unpack my clothes. And at night, I felt I was itchy but tried to dismiss that as part of my imagination/paranoia. Well, turns out nothing was a figment of my imagination. It's really quite disgusting at a hotel that charges $200.00+ a night, so I have written to them in the hopes that they will do something about the room I stayed in (603). So in the meantime, at least avoid that room if not the entire establishment.

<Title>“Very nice! Great location!”
<Content>I think this tends to be a business travelor hotel, but it was perfect for our trip to San Diego. It has a great location right downtown. We booked out hotel on Priceline for $100, so I figured our room would be small and have a horrible view, but I was completely wrong. We had a large room with a view of the city and the pier. The room/bathroom were both extremely clean. Also -- we got there around 1PM and they let us check in -- no questions asked!

<Title>“Top notch hotel!”
<Content>We were on the 11'th floor of the Harbor tower and had a tastefully decorated room with a stunning view of the harbor. At an average room rate of about 40% of retail (won through Priceline) I could not have been happier. There was absolutely no "Priceline" stigma; everyone treated us as if we had booked the presidential suite direct from the hotel. The lobby is as nice as we've seen. The location is perfect (a few blocks from the gaslamp district, adjacent to Seaport village, and across the street from the trolley). Had I paid full price I would have been a little put off by the fact that they do seem to try to "nickel and dime" you a bit (charge $4 for a bottle of water in the room, $5 for 30 minutes on the hotel computer to check personal e-mail, etc.). We also had a little confusion on the parking as we paid for 3 nights but only got credit for 2 nights... they did drop that charge upon me producing the hotel check out receipt though. Overall the location, views, and friendly staff won me over on this one.

<Title>“Great Location, nice view, big hotel, good value”
<Content>Booked this room through a travelzoo special and got a great deal, so I am not unhappy with the value we received. It is a big hotel 1600 rooms, and we normally stay at smaller hotels, however, it was fun to stay here, lots of people, and a great central location to explore San Diego. The good: free breakfast buffet, yummy but lots of calories, oh well that is what vacation is for. The view out the window was excellent, great location, yes we paid $20 for parking and the parking spots were tight, but this is a big city so not unexpected. The front desk was extremely courteous and all requests and check-in was rapid. The pool towels were big and thick, the gas fire in the evening was nice. The seaport shops were right at the base of the hotel and the gaslamp district was walkable so there were many, many dining options nearby. The less than perfect follows: The beds were doubles rather than queens and were comfortable, but unfortunately my 2 children both fell out of bed during the night, one hit his head on the nightstand (they do not normally have this problem), why not just offer some rooms with queen beds? I did not enjoy getting an extra $16.50 charge after we arrived back home, I am not even sure what it was for -> This is very dishonest in my opinion, they could at least e-mail a new billing. The pool was nice, but frigid, I heard many people complaining, what can they not afford to heat it? I will say the hot tubs were also nice and hot, so I could get out and warm up occasionally. The bathrooms were clean and in good repair, but certainly not high end that you should be able to expect at the Hyatt. I did not mind the flower bedspreads but they must be reading these reports because they replaced mine with a solid red one during our stay! The train noise woke us up a few times, but really not too bad and all the other hotels in the area will have this problem anyway. All in all we enjoyed our stay and would return.

<Title>“Breathtaking views”
<Content>Yes, the Grand Hyatt Manchester impresses with its truly grand lobby and location but its the views from the room that took my breath away. Our room, located on the 30th floor of the Harbor tower was tastefully decorated (no awful floral bedspreads as shown in some recent traveler photos!) with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the Coronado bridge, harbor and parts of downtown. We utilized the pool (packed with kids on a Friday afternoon) as well as the well-equipped workout facilities. Self-parking was $20/night but we were not able to find any more affordable options. Ralphs grocery store was just a few blocks away and a great place to stock up on goodies for the room. We left the windows open the first night which made the room a bit noisy as the trains whistled by so the second night we closed the windows and draperies for a much quieter sleep. We didn't hear a peep from the adjoining rooms which also contributed to a most satisfying stay.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>Stayed here for one night. Very impressive facade and lobby, but unfortunately the rooms were only so so. There was warning on the mini bar that if you put personal items in there they would charge you a hefty fee. If you wanted the items removed they woul charge you a fee etc. Water bottles was 4 Dollars. This is usually free at hotels costing 300 Dollars pluss. Rather unusual and not very customer friendly with this minibar warning either. PS Pool is only 3 feet so only suitable for kids. Otherwise OK

<Title>“Great Location!”
<Content>We stayed at the Hyatt over the July 4th weekend... we arrived that day, had a little trouble checking in as they had overbooked for the busy weekend, but got it straightened out.. We went up to the top of the Hyatt to see the fireworks that night which you could see all along the bay, it was a spectacular scene.. we had breakfast the next morning at Lael's downstairs, it was real good, they even have an omlette bar.. after that we walked out the back of the hotel right in to Seaport village.. lots of shops and restaurants.. We ate that night at the Harbor House, the food was less than desirable, but the view was great... next day we walked to Horton Plaza and then had dinner at the gas lamp district.. Le Menarie?? cant recall the name but the concierge at the Hyatt recommended it, and it was the best steak and pasta we have had in a long time! Like I said everything is within walking distance, we took our car, but only used it once to go to mission beach.. there is a train right across the street that takes you all the way to Mexico etc, a ferry out back that takes you across to Coronado island.. The only draw back was those trains at night, but by the third night we got used to them..everyone at the Hyatt was VERY friendly!

<Title>“Wonderful hotel- would definately go back”
<Content>My husband had business on the West Coast in the Los Angeles area - so myself and our two children decided at the last minute to tag along. After 5 days in L.A., we decided to drive down to San Diego for a 3 day getaway. We are from the East Coast and this was our first time in California. I researched a lot of hotels before deciding on this one. I did read reviews about the train noise, so when booking I brought this to the customer service rep and she immediately put me on hold to verify this with the Hotel. She came back on the line and I was told honestly that the train noise can be heard on the lower floors but faintly on the higher floors. My request was made and noted that we would like a room on as high as floor as possible. I recieved an email confirmation stating this - also stating the room would be $299 night. I forgot to state that I am a government employee and would like the government rate. Within 24 hours I got an updated corrected price of $180/night - quite a difference. I would need to bring proof of my govt. employment, etc.. which I did at sign in with no problems. Once there we were impressed with the huge lobby area and great location and views from our window. We were given the 24th floor and did not hear any train sounds at all - and I am a light sleeper. Views of water, boats, etc... were wonderful. I read a review about Lael's buffet - which was fantastic for breakfast and one night for the Italian buffet - yes, it was pricey - but my two children were told they would be given the half price discount without my even asking about it. They are ages 11 and 16 - so not terribly young. Waitors, and the hotel staff in general were very happy to assist and were very friendly. There were always taxi's waiting if you needed one. Rooms were spacious enough and clean. One thing I did not like was that you had to pay to use the work-out room. It was extremely beautiful and had great machines - but I always feel it should be included. I think it was $10 for 2/3 days - not a lot - but should be free !! Other than that - hotel was what we thought it would be and had a great trip !! Vickie

<Title>“Would never go back”
<Content>Was booked for the 4th of July week for 4 nights we ended up staying only 2 nights because the rooms were so old so ugly. My bathroom in my 1 bedroom apartment in Burbank is nicer than the Hyatts. I could not believe my eyes when I saw a plastic Rubbermaid trash can in the bathroom. They put all there money in their lobby and not into there rooms. The only thing I liked was the location and the pool

<Title>“Convenient Location”
<Content>This hotel is very centrally located near the convention center, Petco Park, and the airport. The hotel service and amenities are very good, but are what you'd expect in a large American hotel that caters to convention goers and tourists. The lobby is impressive, but the hotel as a whole doesn't have a lot of character. The rooms in the south tower where I stayed were need of an update so I recommend requesting a room in the more recently renovated north tower.

<Title>“A dreadful stay, uncaring and unresponsive management”
<Content>I normally love Hyatt properties but this one is to be avoided at all costs. Terribly overpriced, located on trolley station which is convenient but don't plan on sleeping. The hotel lobby is beautiful but it is all artiface once you enter the rooms. My "harborview" room overlooked a dumpy horse carriage building with a filthy roof. I was moved to another room which had a better view BUT it was simply ordinary. The window opens about 4 inches and you have to crane your neck to see the view. Styrofoam cups for coffee, no wine glasses in case you wanted to have a bottle from the mini bar and the interior was shabby and run down. THE worst of all is that the general manager did not respond to my complaint during and after my stay. Hyatt Consumer Affairs gave me a boiler plate response, offering me a free night if I return after trying to contact them numerous times.The Friday Night Seafood Buffett at $29.00 a person was a waste of money. I loved San Diego and will return again and again but never to this supposed luxury resort. After this experience I am going to rethink Hyatt after the lack of response and follow through.

<Title>“Very nice stay at the Hyatt”
<Content>The Manchester Hyatt is a huge hotel -- very Vegas-style, with an oversized lobby, two towers, multiple restaurants, etc... Although it clearly caters to the convention crowd, we thought that it was great for our quick family getaway as well. Excellent location in the city -- close to the Gaslamp Quarter, right next to Seaport Village. Room was very nice, although nothing spectacular. Service was very good. Overall a very enjoyable stay.

<Title>“Excellent Property”
<Content>I have to give the hotel a lot of credit, I was expecting a dour corporate hotel, and got the opposite. The staff could not have been friendlier. Everyone always had a smile, and asked if we needed anything. We decided to go to San Diego for my 40th birthday, and booked at the last minute. The location of the hotel could not be better (we were not looking for a beach property, but a fun weekend). The hotel is next to Seaport Village, which is quant; and within walking distance to the gas lamp, and the Coronado Ferry. The views from the rooms were outstanding. The spa is nice and friendly. I need to give special notice to the room service, the food was great. The egg sandwich for breakfast is wonderful. The hotel was immaculate, and large. The atmosphere in the hotel seemed to me a lot like a Las Vegas mega resort (everybody happy, and a lot of activity). It should be noted, we were there on a weekend ony, and the Red Sox were in town, so the hotel was filled with chowder heads. I will definately stay here again.

<Title>“Loved this Hotel!”
<Content>I would highly recommend this hotel in San Diego. The location is perfect for walking around downtown, the Gaslamp Quarter, and Seaport Village. Easy access to trolleys and buses. The hotel is beautiful, with 5-star service. The breakfast buffet is great with lots of options. Our room was large with a very comfortable bed and a quiet air conditioner. There is nothing I would change.

<Title>“Watch out for overbilling!”
<Content>Spent 6 nights at the Manchester Grand Hyatt with my wife and daughter. The Good: Excellent location - close to Seaport Village, Gaslamp Quarter, convention center, PETCO Park, USS Midway, public transportation, etc. - gorgeous lobby - fast elevators, attractive, resort-like outdoor pool area, decent restaurants (recommend Anne-Marie's for Starbucks coffee, light snacks. Seafood at Sally's was also very good, though on the pricey side) - generally good service The Not-so-Good: - very average, smallish room, poor soundproofing (could hear neighbors talking, showering), running toilet (leaked on last day), spotty housekeeping, had to ask twice for cot, pricey breakfast buffet ($22 p.p.) with no children's discount, only a la carte kids menu. The Bad: - overbilled for breakfast at Lael's Restaurant. Bill for just the three of us came out to $149!!! Hotel is investigating, though more than a week has passed and still haven't heard anything. - also charged $7.50 for mini-bar even though declined at check-in. At least this was quickly reversed. All in all, I might have given the Manchester Grand Hyatt a qualified 4-star rating were it not for the breakfast billing issue. As it is, I strongly advice anyone considering staying there to keep/request copies of all receipts charged to their room.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>This is a very large property that caters to a lot of conventions and business travelers, so your experience likely will vary depending on how many guests are staying there and how many people are in front of you in the registration/checkout lines. The property consists of two large hotel towers, connected by a huge lobby and registration area that reminds one of a large railroad station from years gone by. First, you have the location: Right on the harbor, overlooking the water. Great views, probably from pretty much every room, but you may want to ask when booking. Seaport Village, a shopping area in the style of a New England fishing village, is next door. The rooms are gorgeous. They have great views and are well appointed. They are not particularly large, but their sizes are comparable to most city convention and business hotels today. For business and convention travelers, the setup is perfect. The hotel has multiple bars and restaurants and a complete business center. There is shopping if that is your avocation. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful on two separate stays. As you might expect, there is a price for all of this. Nothing is cheap, and (almost) nothing is free. That doesn't make this hotel different from others in its class, however. If you stay here, you won't do so on a small budget, but you also won't forget it.

<Title>“Best if you are a business traveler”
<Content>My husband and i just returned from a vacation in san diego. we stayed two weekend nights at the hyatt. This is in a great location, however it is geared more towards the business traveler. Obviously it's a convention hotel. we got a great rate of 156.00 for two nights. the hotel also charges $20 a night for parking. So for $176 plus tax you get a nice room. not spectactular but clean and spacious, most with nice views. i found the staff to be very offish and borderline unfriendly. not rude but not friendly. we were celebrating a belated honeymoon trip and although it was clearly on the reservation we made online there was no mention of it at check in. nothing. i used to work at a hotel front desk and we always were trained to make it special for the couple with acknowledgment and upgrades if possible. it appeared to us that the woman who checked us in was bitter. So all in all i think it was great for a few nights, clean, and in a great location for walking downtown. i found the charges for everything too much for the average "tourist". Not a problem if your company is picking up the bill but you get nickled and dimed to death otherwise. Ten dollars a day for internet access as well. most hotels these days offer this complimentary. The rate of $156 was adequate but i wouldn't pay a dime more to stay at this hotel. We moved to the hampton inn downtown for a few days and it was GREAT. Friendly as can be, parking $12, free breakfast, and bright spacious rooms. only drawback of that one was the train noise but we didn't minde it at all. i'd rather stay in a clean, friendly hotel and hear a train than stay in an unfriendly four star.

<Title>“A very enjoyable stay”
<Content>This hotel is a great place for a convention which i just returned from (IBM's CTRE) last week. The lobby is beautiful and the meeting rooms and food served during the event were great. Check-in was quick and painless and my wife and I were given a room on the 24th floor with a great view. It was obvious the hotel has the capability to accomodate and check-in a huge number of guests at once. There was occasional train noise as others have stated but it did not bother me. Probably the higher up you are the least annoying that will be. The guest rooms were very nice and the only complaint really is the beds were too hard for my liking. The 1st night i slept very little but the 2nd and 3rd nights i slept OK but not great. There were at least 3 other smaller conventions going on at the same time we were there so it was very busy. This hotel is probably not a good choice if you just want to go somewhere and relax for a few days.

<Title>“Perfect!!”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at this hotel in July 2004, shortly after we got married in Vegas, the hotel was fantastic, we had a corner room with floor to ceiling windows. The room had all the usual mod cons, including a sofa and table and a large bathroom the view from the room was just fantastic. Whether we were upgraded because of our wedding I am not sure. The hotel is located in the Seaport Village, there are some great little eateries there, including a great pizza place where you can get a pitcher of beer and a great pizza while watching the sun set just perfect. We visited San Diego Zoo while we were there, which I can highly recommend and we also took a cruise around San Diego harbour. Also worth a visit is the grand hotel, the hotel del coronado. San Diego is definitely a city I would like to return to in the future.

<Title>“I Expected Worse”
<Content>We stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt for four nights for a convention, starting April 29, 2007. I was worried because of the previous poor reviews, however the hotel was not too bad. It's in a beautiful setting and is a beautiful facility. I agree that the rooms are probably overpriced, but our room was very clean and comfortable. We had no problems and no complaints. The same cannot be said for the rest of the convention guests. Many arrived to find out that the hotel was overbooked by 120 rooms and had to stay elsewhere. The convention was booked four years in advance! How could Hyatt screw something up so bad? Anyway, the hotel was adequate, but I would not stay there again due to the overpriced rooms. It was not a very good value for the money.

<Title>“Subpar hotel for the price, horrible service”
<Content>I stayed there for a conference at the convention center. The room that they put me in was a smoking room with a bed that folds into the wall. and a huge conference table. Actually, I can't call it a bed since it was more like a cott. I could hear the springs with every twist and turn during the night. The worst part was that it was as small as my bed when I lived in a dorm room. I complained to management since I requested a king bed and non-smoking. For $250 a night, you should at least get a non-smoking room. The only response was that they were sold out and they were sorry. No sympathy was given. The staff did not try to accomodate my requested room. I'm glad that they gave me a huge table so I could try to invite some random people over and throw a poker tournament. Ridiculously bad service and not worth the month. Go to one of the boutique Kimpton hotels downtown instead for the same price.

<Title>“Nice hotel”
<Content>My wife, 14 year old son, and I stayed two nights (4/6 and 4/7/07) in the "older" tower on the 21st floor. Nice clean room and bathroom, great beds, and a window that opens a few inches..enough to let in the nice sea air. The staff was extremely friendly and didn't mention the deep discounted internet P-line price. Our room overlooked the large, and busy pool and jacuzzi area. There were quite a few families with small children using the pool, which was warm. The exercise room is above average and you can avoid the $5.00 use fee by flashing your Hyatt card. The internet charge is a gouge and it's impossible to find out how much it costs unless you ask the front desk. There is no free internet in the lobby either. The parking of $20.00 per night in a covered building also seems extravagant in light of the amount people normally pay just to stay in the hotel. I thought the location was very convenient. Petco Park (home of the Padres) is an easy 13 minute walk. The Gaslamp District is only three or so blocks away. There is a great place to jog in the nearby park and cement trail along the edge of the marina. We didn't use the restaurant, but had a drink in the downstairs bar. I think we paid about $7.75 for an old fashioned and $7.50 for a glass (not a pint) of draft Pilsner Urquel. Considering a whole six pack is usually less than that, it's steep. One downside is the train tracks that are across the street. On Friday night two trains rambled very slowly through town and blew their horn at each and every intersection. With the window open, I thought the train was coming into the room. It woke me, my wife and probably half of downtown. My son, however, slept through it. The trains came by at 12:30 am and 2:30 am. Overall, I was glad we got this hotel and if I bid again for a 4* in the downtown area, I'd be happy to get it.

<Title>“Beautiful but......”
<Content>The hotel lobby was absolutely gorgeous but the room was average and the bathroom was filthy. The shower had hair (the unpleasant kind) all over it and the bathroom floor needed to be cleaned. To make matters worse, I found the maid reading a magazine right next to our room door. We were the last room on the left, a great place for a worker to hide if they’re feeling lazy. If you want a nice "quiet" hotel this is NOT the place for you. The noise from the bay area, the ships and the helicopters flying over can a bit overwhelming. Don’t even think about taking a nap with your window open if you're on the lower levels (we were on 18 and still heard everything). Last but not least, the garage overcharged us. The conference rate was 8.00 a day, not 20.00.

<Title>“Very Nice!”
<Content>After reading all the reviews I was not looking forward to staying here, but our convention was at the hotel and we had an evening banquet and a morning meeting to attend. First, I new self-parking was $19-20.00 a night ,but we went valet for $26.00 a night, just a splurge for no hassle carrying through parking garage and lobby. I requested the newer Seaport Tower, the clerk offered a higher room in the older tower but I wanted the newer tower hoping for the best. Plus, that weekend was forcasted for grey weather anyway. We were on the 7 th floor and the room looked hardly used. The furniture was new, beds were great, lots of fluffy pillows, nice sheets, new carpet and most important, very clean! Bathroom has granite sink tops, new fixtures and somebody mentioned about he plain floor tile from Home Depot, big deal, at least its new and very clean! Amenties included a blowdryer and Portico ginger shampoos and lotion. Something else that you don't often have is a separate vanity cabinet to place extras on, that was nice. I have to say it is true about the windows being dirty, but you can still see through them and they open. I read that they don't have a coffee maker, so I asked the bell hop and he had one sent up with in 5 min. no charge! The staff was excellant, no complaints. All and all it was way better than I expected and I will come back for following conventions.

<Content>We stayed at the Manchester Hyatt for 6 days. The location was great and so was the view. Really nice pool area had a great view of the harbor. Right next to Seaport Village. As far as the hotel goes, I would most likely look for another place to stay for my next trip. For the amount it cost per night, I would have expected to have fresh towels everyday, without having to request them. Had to ask for a fresh bar of soap after the 4th day. There was hair on the floor when we checked in and there was still hair on the floor when we checked out. A coffee maker in the room would have been a nice touch too. I booked this room 6 months in advance asking for a King bed in a view room. We ended up with 2 double beds. It's not like we didn't give them enough notice. For the most part, the staff was friendly and helpful. Overall, it was an 'OK' place to stay, but there are lots of other options in that same area.

<Title>“Clueless staff, awful service for top$$$”
<Content>Came to San Diego for a medical conference and some rest and relaxation from the daily grind. I checked into the "Grand" Hyatt on a Saturday afternoon with other conference goers and was shuttled efficiently to the front desk. Once I got there, I simply asked to check into my room with two queen beds and a rollaway bed since there would be a total of 3 guests. Instead, I was offered a conference suite, which I was told, was MUCH larger and contained 3 full size beds. I ascended to my floor and rushed to open the door after going through a long cross-country flight and surprise........the security latch was fastened!?! Easy to fix, right? Well, not exactly after talking to the front desk staff for 10 minutes and security for 15 minutes, I was still not in my room yet. Should've stayed out on second thought for once the door opened, I found a large conference table, a TV area/sitting room, and a barren kitchenette and.....1 FOLD UP FULL BED. After two calls downstairs to the juvenille staff, two rollaway TWIN beds were brought up for me and my fellow tall colleagues. Next was the unsatisfying and overpriced "meal" I had in one of the restaurant bars. After paying nearly $30 for a glorified sandwich, a piece of pie, and 2 beers, I was told that the bill could not be split unless we called a manager....and stay there any longer....nope. The end all was the half hour me and my 2 colleagues spent trying to obtain 3 receipts for our share of the room costs. Instead of simply dividing the total into three, the 20-something year old clerk chose to turn it into a college calculus problem and proceeded to take over 25 minutes to solve it while other guests in line sneered. All of this is not even mentioning the broken jacuzzi, the guacamole smeared on the pool patio that was fodder for dive-bombing seagulls, and "bargain" $6 bottle of Evian water in our room. Oh, and if this wasn't enough, the underpaid workers at the hotel appear to be semi-on strike with large signs petitioning the hotel's "blue blood" owner to pay up. My advice is avoid this place like the plague despite its convenience to the Convention Center and the Gaslamp area.

<Title>“Never Judge A Book By Its Cover”
<Content>This hotel looks really great on the outside and in the public halls, but the rooms are NOT worth the price. I gave this hotel a terrible rating due to the staff. Otherwise, I would have given it an okay, but problems rating. Rooms: Very EARLY 1990s, floral bed spread, old looking bathrooms, worn carpet, low ceilings, bad furniture... a $99 room rate is more like it.. not $250 as we paid. Gym: GREAT gym. Loved it... full small sized gym... free weights, cardio machines, weight machines... its really great. Hotel Staff: I had a problem with the front desk. One woman, Suzette, was VERY rude. I asked her for my boxes.... on a Saturday night, my arrival, and she said no one in the hotel could get them to me as the business center was closed. I asked again... no one can get them to me? And she again said no. I then said, there has to be someone in the hotel who can get them to me... you are charging me to hold them are you not? She said yes and I said to her... well then I should be able to get them whenever I need them. (I needed them that night) She said she would try to get them to me. I had told her I needed a book and some papers that were in one of the boxes. She was able to get the boxes with the help of security and when they delivered them to me she said... "these boxes sure look like paper to me" as she rolled her eyes and gave me this ugly stare. I told her that I understood she was having to go out of her way to get these boxes for me and that I appreciated her efforts, but she had no right to talk to me like that. I told her I was paying for the boxes and that I should be able to get them anytime I wanted them. I asked her if she wanted me to open them up for her so she could see the papers I needed and she just remained silent. I called down to the manager on duty and he said she must have not meant what she said! Nice apology huh? This hotel needs a lesson on service! Would I stay here again... NEVER!

<Title>“room for improvement”
<Content>We stayed at the manchester grand hyatt for a conference, and while it was adequate, there was considerable room for improvement. Small touches, such as turn-down service, robes, or plenty of towels, were missing. The restaurants in the hotel were only fair in the quality of food - you are better off going to many of the excellent restaurants in the neighborhood. Trying to get a cup of coffee on Friday morning, I was met by a surly barman who was offended that I did not have change for a $20. His coffee was bad, too. Ever afterwards, I want across the street to Starbucks. The spa was quite nice, with a beautiful sauna and steam. The bellmen were all helpful. This is no luxury hotel, but it could be much better with small changes.

<Title>“Comfortable but not 4-star”
<Content>The Grand Hyatt has a really impressive lobby but the rooms should not be considered high-end. The staff was courteous and accommodating, and the location is great. I booked this through Priceline for $150 a night. I would have definitely been a little upset if I had paid full price. It's worth staying here when you get the rooms at a discount.

<Title>“Beautiful, expensive hotel with super-stinky tolietries”
<Content>My strongest impression of the hotel is how overpriced the rooms are. The special group rate for my conference was $235/night which was slightly cheaper than the $259/night listed on the website. After reading other reviews of the hotel, I used priceline to book the room and paid only $95/night! I am shocked at the price difference. The hotel is nice, but the rooms are way too small and plain to justify the steep price. I was impressed with the gym and pool area. The staff member in the gym was very polite. The concierge was also very nice and gave me a great recommendation for a casual lunch nearby. The bartenders at the Grand Lobby bar were sweet and attentive. The front desk staff were also great. I was disappointed there wasn't a coffee maker in the room which is always included at other hotels. Also, Hyatt has the WORST SMELLING tolietries in the entire industry. At least a dozen other people at my conference commented at how disgusting the smell was. I really hope they use something different in the future. Seriously, any drug store shampoo, conditioner, soap, and lotion that you bring with you will be much better than the horrible stuff in the room.

<Title>“Not a 4 star hotel at all!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed there for 2 nights 02/17/07, 02/18/07. We had a reservation for a Queen or King bed. As we arrived at the hotel at 11 PM we were told that they were really busy, but they still had non-smoking room for us. The girl at the counter told us that she was going to put us in a room twice the size of a normal room, with a really comfortable pull–up, good size bed. It was all just a lie as we realized later when we entered our room. Our room was actually not a room at all, but the living room of a suite. They had divided a suite, so that they can offer it as a separate room, when they run out of rooms. The room was smaller than normal. The bed was a double size, pull-up bed that had to fit 2 people. We were able to hear the conversation in the bedroom of the suite we were in. My overall impression of the hotel was that is that the staff was unfriendly and trained to mislead the customers instead of apologizing to them when necessary. What room you get is a matter of chance - they probably have some nicer rooms but also rooms like the one we stayed in. My personal opinion is that a 4 star hotel should not put their customers in a living room of a suite, with a pull up, double, uncomfortable bed. A 4 star hotel should never allow their staff to mislead their customers either, but this is just a personal opinion....

<Title>“Room with a view!”
<Content>My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the Manchester Hyatt. After entering through the gorgeous lobby, we were greeted by a very friendly staff person. Though we had booked through Priceline for $95, she offered us a non-smoking King overlooking the bay. We didn't even request it! We were not treated any differently as Priceline users. The room was very nice, with a lovely view of the bay. It wasn't huge, but it was just my husband and me, so there was plenty of space for two. The bed was very comfortable and we had an assortment of pillows to choose from. My only complaint was that the bathroom shower tile had some mildew on the grout that I was able to remove easily with one swipe of a washcloth (it wasn't permanently discolored). That bothered me because housekeeping should have taken care of it. Otherwise, everything else about our stay was perfect. Parking was $20 with in/out privileges, so we were able to come and go. Because of other plans, we didn't eat at the Hyatt or use any of the facilities.

<Title>“A step up from Motel 6”
<Content>My husband and I had reservations for a smoking/king room. We checked in 5 minutes after check-in time and the less-than-congenial girl at the counter advised us that they had already run out of those rooms. She put us in a non-smoking room with slightly-bigger-than-twin beds on the 23rd floor. We had to go down 23 floors via the nauseating elevator ride every time we wanted to smoke. VERY INCONVENIENT, and could have been avoided had they honored our reservation request. The beds, in and of themselves, weren't as uncomfortable as I had gathered from other reviews. The problem was the size - they are TINY (even for us, and we hardly take up much space)!!!! Good luck trying to fit 2 adults on one of those things!! I ended up moving to the other bed just so we could have more room. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but when I travel, I like to sleep in the same bed as my husband.... just another one of those conveniences you might expect when you stay at a 4-star hotel, but whatever. The floral bedspreads did remind me of Motel 6, but I think it's just part of the whole English countryside theme. The sheets were nice and the pillows were either down or down alternative and were pretty comfortable too. The ironing board was very dirty and actually really gross. There wasn't a coffee maker in the room, unless it was in the mini-bar that was locked (why lock up the coffee?). We were afraid they'd charge some outlandish fee for the key, so we didn't bother trying to get one. A lady comes around in the morning to ask you when you're leaving. It's like they can't wait to get you out of there!! Ironic, since they don't hold reservations anyway. The girl that checked us out was very friendly, however, and much nicer than the one that checked us in. The lobby is great but that's about it. This place really isn't worth the money, unless you're getting a REALLY great deal. My husband would definately recommend the Marriott over the Hyatt!

<Title>“Great location, lobby, but the rest if mediocre”
<Content>The location is fantastic. It is on the boardwalk, ten minute walk from the Gaslight, close to the airport, and in a safe neighborhood. There is a Ralph's, Office Depot, Starbucks, and Trolley stop within walking distance as well. Pros: Location Nice staff; everybody was helpful and cheerful Pretty lobby Mostly quiet (see below) in the rooms; you hear the usual doors slamming, hallway conversations and running water, but it's no worse than anywhere else Quick, plentiful elevators Rooms are decent size The brunch in the hotel restaurant was good, and expensive as expected, but a nice splurge. The waiter was incredibly solicitious and pleasant, and made the experience relaxing and enjoyable. Cons Expensive for what you get; the rooms are dated and a bit shabby. There is no indoor pool; although there is a lovely outdoor pool and sunning area, we couldn't use it and my bathing suit sat unused in my suitcase, Not so quiet at 6:00 am when the helicopters from the Naval Ships stationed nearby hover above the water and the tugboats blast their horns Does many functions at once; meetings, weddings, charity events, so you may come at a busy time and not get the room you requested. I almost didn't get a nonsmoking room; a tip from the check-in guy is call the day before and specifically request the room you want to be reserved for you. It also can get chaotic with all these events and get very loud and crowded in public areas. We couldn't get to the bar on the 40th floor at any time during our stay because it was so crowded we were turned away. Everything is expensive, a diet coke and lemonade were eight bucks. The water in the room is 6 bucks (walk to Starbucks across the street, it is 2.75 there for a bottle of water). My own personal gripes: The toiletries smell weird. I don't know what's in them, but they really stink. Bring your own stuff. On the day of checkout, the housekeeper tried to open the door while I was getting dressed, around 10am. Checkout is clearly stated on the back of the door as noon, yet somebody from the front desk came around 11:00 to ask when I might get around to checking out. If checkout is noon, don't bother me until after that. I have until noon, I've paid until noon, and unless you want to give me back some of my cash, the hotel can wait until I check out at noon. I thought that was really rude. The water pressure is low and the water is really soft (or is it hard? It is the one that makes you still feel soapy after you've rinsed off). I expected better. If you want to be close to the water and have lots within walking distance, it's a decent choice. I just didn't think for over two hundred a night it was spectacular.

<Title>“Beautiful View”
<Content>This hotel is in the perfect location -- right at the Seaport Village. It's not very far from the airport or the Zoo. We had a Bay view room with beautiful views. We saw the Reagan ship come in from Iraq. This was a thrill for my son. We were there 4th of July and they had a georgous fireworks display! The Manchester Hyatt lobby is beautiful. The rooms are average, but clean. The trains that go by in the middle of the night are very noisy. This must be so at all of the hotels in the area. The hotel does charge for parking. We had breakfast buffet included with our room which was delicious. The pool is very nice for children. We also used the spa pool when there was an event going on at the regular one -- very nice. I would definitely recommend the Manchester Hyatt. We are even thinking of going back again. San Diego's weather can't be beat! I

<Title>“Not Worth It!!!!”
<Content>If you want to sleep this isn't the place for you. We recently stayed at the Manchester Hyatt for a family reunion. The problem was the noise from the trains and the beds were so uncomfortable, no one could get a good nights sleep. Which ruined the day time activities because we were all tired. The only thing I really liked about this place is the location. Your close to the Gaslamp District and Seaport Village, which is nice, but there are other hotels in the same area. My firends stayed at a nearby hotel with better beds and they didn't hear the train. The price isn't right.

<Title>“Very disappointing”
<Content>Despite my status with the Hyatt. There were only 2 impressive things about this hotel. The outside and the lobby. The rest from staff (More trainees than I care to count), to the rooms (Old and significantly outdated - If you like the 70s look then this is a place for you) were terrible. The price is steep and parking is $19/day. I don't mind paying if we are getting 5 star service and quality. We stayed there for 2 nights and were asked to change room after the first because some one else had our room the following night. Checking in at Gold Passport was meaning less. It too us 45 min to check-in with the trainee. Overall, serverely disappointed. I would never stay here again.

<Title>“Its Big with Beautiful Lobby and...Thats about it.”
<Content>I got this hotel from the priceline for 100/night on a day before convention. It was a very busy weekend and seems like everyone was busy preparing for something big thats coming up. However, I was just there to have a relaxing weekend visiting San Diego For the first time. I did alot of the research online (including research here) and noticed there alot of the people refer to stay at a newer tower however people will charge you extra $ since its newer . In my case, I was pretty lucky that the check in guy offered me a complimentary upgrade to the new tower but did not offer me the regency club room since its all gone and he was saying there's not much difference besides the Flat screen TV. The Lobby is HUGE. One of the biggest hotel lobby I have ever seem. It IS pretty connecting 2 towers altogether. The Room we had was on the 24th floor, facing the ocean and the room size is OK, not big not small but the furniture is a bit WORN. The color of the room makes it seem really old and our biggest complain is the BED. Its to my understanding that Hyatt should be upgraded their mattress by now (as stated in their website). HOWEVER, the bed at this hotel was NOT upgraded. It is those mattress withOUT pillowtop, bad linen and the floral top bedspread (God I HATE this kind of bed, I have to give credits for Hilton Hotel for having such a wonderful bed which makes me doesn't want to wake up in the morning). And btw, their pillow is PRETTY flat too, like those u will get at the coach class flight. The shower room is just SO SO but I like their white ginger collection, they smells just right. The parking is easy with in&out previliages, the staffs are generally friendly but they certainly look understaffed and the staffs do complain about the lack of manpower in the hotel. The concerige recommended the "Fish Market" too. IT is a short walk from the hotel and it got a nice view of the bay, but the food is so so. I am from Orange County and for the price, I think u can find a better quality seafood (and more variety) at Market Broiler (in the Block of Orange), just to get u an idea how their seafood quality r like. However, the real Perk for this hotel is their buffet. They offered Friday night seafood and Sat BBQ and Sun Brunch. Whereas Sunday brunch is my favorite. They have the BEST oysters I had in buffets (Even better than those vegas buffet). They serve the TRUE restaurant quality seafood (go there if u eat tons of food and picky as I am). I think its better value to eat here than eating sunday brunch on the Hotel Del Mar on the Corona Island. THey aren't as all that as they seem. Being a historic hotel can not justify everything (esp the QUALITY, and their bathroom STINKS!!). Good Job for Hyatt for this part! They have a lovely jacuzzi and tennis court on 5th floor? Everyone should try that out. and I really, really hope that Hyatt would make an effort to listen to their customer's complain b/c my friend whom stayed at the Hyatt 2 wks ago (in vancouver) had problem with hsi rooms but management NEVER responded ever since. It seems like a common problem among the hyatt chain hotels. I was hoping to stay at Omnis but I had to stay where priceline would take me. I still had great experiences neverless, just that next time, I hope I can get to stay at other hotels but would come back for the great seafood buffet (and their desserts are GREAT too)!

<Title>“Grand to be sure...”
<Content>I stayed at the Manchester Grand Hyatt in early November. I went for a conference but I took my mom as well since she had never been to San Diego. The hotel was great. VERY centrally located and right on the water. There are two towers and we were able to see the bay and the mountains from our window. Our window opened which was great. The hotel also offers complimentary compact refrigerators so call the front desk and get one to keep all your bottled water cool or for snacks. The one thing I will say about our room is that it wasn't very soundproof. I could hear doors slamming at night (there were kids on our floor) and people talking. The fitness center was very nice but you had to be a member of the Hyatt Gold Passport Club if you wanted to workout for free so sign up (the membership is free and you can sign up online)! The pool was awesome although we didn't pack our suits and it was too cold two of the days we were there. The jacuzzis did seem very popular. The hotel was located behind Seaport Village which was rather touristy but had some unique little shops. The hotel is also close to the Gaslamp District which has many restaurants to choose from within a couple of blocks radius. I would never encourage anyone to walk around a strange city by themselves but I will say that I felt extremely safe in the area around our hotel. Across the street towards the downtown area was actually very residential (lots of condos and townhouses) and then a few blocks down more commercial (shopping, restaurants, etc). I would definitely consider staying there again for a vacation.

<Title>“Big but ok conference hotel”
<Content>Like almost everyone else, I suppose, I was there for a conference. This hotel has expanded significantly in the past few years, corresponding to growth in the San Diego convention business, and it is <BIG>. Public rooms and facilities are pretty nice -- well equipped and maintained. My sleeping room, in the original tower, was satisfactory, but hardly distinguished. Carpet was stained in a couple of places, towels seemed a bit worn, and the whole thing was just a little worn. It was what one would anticipate if the hotel were operating on a basis of not expecting to see the customer again anytime soon. That said, from a meeting perspective, it worked like a well-oiled machine. So, if a little soulless, at least, unlike others, the trains ran on time. Downside to restaurant was that breakfast appeared to be entirely self-service buffet, and there was a 20 minute wait for a table, even though many tables were seen open throughout the room. In that regard, it was not conducive to doing business. Those comments notwithstanding, cast your eye to the harbor and the water and just take in the view. It makes up for a lot! Would I stay there again? Probably. No better or worse than the neighboring Marriott. But they could do better.

<Title>“The Lobby, Restaurant, and Bar are Beautiful...but the ROOMS SUCK!”
<Content>Just wanted to give my $0.02. Not much different than the rest. I would not pay a dime over $100 for this hotel. The lobby is gorgeous, and restaurants and bars were great. But the rooms were a tad bit more spruced up than a cheap-o hotel. The only thing "Grand" about this Hyatt is it's size. The rooms are small and carpet/beds/restroom are seriously pathetic for a 4-star mind you. Oh....and Mr. Manchester (Manchester Grand Hyatt) has every hallway in the lobby covered with pictures of himself. That is just lame....obviously cares more about his self image than the numberous customer complaints about this hotel. I can't think of a single hotel I've ever stayed at when the owner had pictures of himself everywhere. LAME FYI: Self Parking $19 Night / Valet $20 Night

I had to pay to use the workout facilities, internet) but the hotel was beautiful, close to everything, had a great pool and the service was also very good. If you want to splurge, I would recommend it.

<Title>“Only a few disappointments”
<Content>I attended a business conference at the Manchester this past weekend, November 9-12. It was a very large convention, and the very large convention facilities had no difficulty in handling this large group. I had pre-booked a non-smoking king bed, but was told it was unavailable when I arrived. I could take two single beds or upgrade (for $40) to a "panoramic view" room with a king. I chose the upgrade. It was a corner room, with a view of the bay and of the front of the hotel. The lobby is very beautiful, and the staff handling check-in was wonderful. (Staff was wonderful throughout my stay.) The room was a bit of a disappointment, as the carpet is getting old and one of three big windows was blocked by a wall. I had visited the Hyatt website right before the trip and was anticipating the new bed, six pillows, and iPod-ready radio-alarm clock... perhaps a flat screen LCD TV. None of these were present in my room. I ordered room service a few times, which arrived in a timely manner and was appealing. I ordered sausage with my breakfast one morning but got bacon. I called to let Room Service know and they offered to reduce the charge on the tab. When I checked out they had not done that, and no one associated with Room Service has any recollection of that offer. To their credit, they immediately reduced that charge by 25%. In-room internet was wireless, but required a credit card and could not be billed to the room. I wish all hotels offered free internet connections in every room. Charge for this was $9.95 per day. The area surrounding the hotel is great, and fun for exploring. I enjoyed visiting the KC Barbeque restaurant and bar directly across from the hotel, the site of filming the "sleazy bar scene" in Top Gun. It's teeny-tiny. I was on the 17th floor and happy I was not a floor below that. The previous reviews mention noise from the trains and they are LOUD. The trolley trains make a little noise as they come by, but the AMTRAK trains blow their VERY loud horns at each intersection. Because of the convergence of streets right at the hotel, there's at least two intersections the train has to go through right there. Some trains just gave a little blast but some engineers must have enjoyed really leaning on the horn! I will say that I was not disturbed in my sleep, though. Thick curtains? I'd recommend as high a floor as you can get. And if you do, you'll find that the elevator service was spectacular. I never had to wait long for a ride, despite the large crowd in the hotel.

<Title>“Nice Business Hotel”
<Content>My company had a business conference at the Manchester and I stayed for two nights. About 250 people attended the conference, and the meeting rooms were nicely prepared, and the staff was helpfull. The room were nice, and my room had a nice view of the bay. I would stay here again. The food prices were high, but there are a lot of dining options in seaport village which is right next to the hotel.

<Title>“It's a big hotel, so . . .”
<Content>I usually don't like big convention hotels, but the Manchester Grand did a decent job. Nice corner room with water views. Loved that the window opened, hated that it was dirty. Really disliked those noisy middle-of-the-night trains. The coffee bar in the lobby was convenient, and had better food choices than many, but closed at 3 p.m. -- and no signs indicating that! A cup of tea was hard to find in the afternoon. The view from the 40th floor bar was lovely, but the service there was nonexistent: we ended up leaving our table and going to the bar to get a drink. Valets, housekeeping staff and concierges were personable and well informed.

<Title>“Good hotel, great location”
<Content>We had stayed, only recently, at the Radisson Bayview; for only a little more money, we got in this time into the Manchester Grand Hyatt for something like $250. What a difference! This was a luxurious hotel with brilliant views. The 40th floor bar was open until 2 a.m. The ambiance was wonderful, and the location terrific. It's close to downtown, close to the harbor, close to Seaport Village, and pretty easy to access from the freeway. (Straight down Front Street, right on Market.) Only irritants - a $10 charge for the internet. Started with DSL, then found I could no longer connect and switched to wireless. Had to get the charge adjusted to avoid being double-charged. Parking was $19. (Radisson was $12). Still, it was an easy carpark to access, not a tight squeeze as in the Radisson.

<Title>“Over priced.....”
<Content>My wife, daughter and I stayed at the Manchester Hyatt from Sept 23 to Sept 27. I’m going to include more than just the Hyatt in my report in the hope that you’ll find the information useful. ORBITZ: I booked a complete package deal that included flight, hotel and rental car through Orbitz. A day after I made my booking I realized I could have save a little over $100 if I had booked the pieces individually through Orbitz. I notified Orbitz (because they advertised that I would save money by booking a package), while they were sympathetic, they said, “thanks for letting us know, but we can’t verify your claim”, even though I could pull up put each piece (flight, car and room) add them together and show them they were less than the package I bought. They had no interest in verifying my claim, because they “had no way to see each component” from their computer. A manager finally did agree to either cancel my package so I could book the components individually, or send me a voucher for $100 off my next Orbits booking – like I’m going to use them again…. RENTAL CAR: Whatever you do not use Advantage Rental cars. They are a complete rip-off. It seems like they have only one bus that runs every hour, and the people are very unfriendly with long lines. I’ve had personal problems with them and many people I’ve spoken with have also had problems. I rented a car from Alamo. The people behind the desk were great, very friendly and helpful, but the car (Impala) was really dirty. I could barely see out of the windshield. HYATT: For the money (around $280+tax/night) for a standard room there are better hotels. The valets are very good, especially the guy in the suit – he’s excellent. We arrived at 11:00 AM, had not trouble checking-in, and getting a room. The room was very typical – nothing special. While they advertise having two pools, one of the pools is for spa users only, so in reality you only have free use of one pool. I think it’s absurd that they charge $10/24 hours for Internet service (wireless or hardwired). Especially when it’s 802.11b at 11 mbps and my card only picked it up at 54%. Numerous times during my stay their access points went down and I lost my connection and my work (I should know better). After some discussion with the manager, he agreed to waive my charge for a day because of crashes. Still, considering the price of the room – Internet should be free, and reliable. Room service was fast and friendly, the food good, but a bit over priced. The workout room is adequate, but crowed in the morning – as you would expect. The Hyatt is a next to the train tracks so every night you’ll hear a very loud train whistle at 3:00 AM – I’m sure you can hear it at other hotels as well, but the Hyatt is right next to it so it’s really loud. AREA RESTAURANTS: The concierge directed us to the Fish Market for dinner. (He claimed it was less expensive, less touristy and had a better menu than the restaurants in the Gaslamp district – he must get kick-backs, because it wasn’t so.) It was OK – crowed, a little expensive and noisy with indifferent service. We waited in line at 20 minutes just to make a reservation and to get one of those electronic gadgets that lights up when your table is ready. We waited another 20 minutes after checking in with the hostess before a table was available. As a hint; you may want to go upstairs to the “Top of the Market”. There wasn’t a line, and you can usually get seated immediately. The entrees are little more ($4-6 a plate), but the choices are greater and it’s quieter. We also ate at Fred’s Mexican Restaurant on Fifth Street; expensive and uninspired. Despite what they say on their menu, their meat is tough and unidentifiable. Their margaritas are very watered-down. Not worth the money.

<Title>“A Great Hotel”
<Content>The Manchester Grand Hyatt was a brilliant base for a fantastic holiday. The location & the standard of the hotel were first class and the rooms were very comfortable and very clean. I had a room in the southern most tower over-looking the pool deck, Seaport Village & USS Midway and would ask for this view again even though I have heard that the other tower is the newer of the two. I have seen reviews on this forum stating that Hotel Staff were too eager for tips but I never experienced this at all, staff were polite & ready to help but only when asked for. I had a slight problem with the plumbing in my room as the water never diverted fully to the shower head, instead it ran half from the bath taps & half from the shower - but this didn't bother me too much & I didn't want the hastle of complaining. I will return without question.

<Title>“Nicely Located Convention Hotel”
<Content>I had stayed at this hotel in 1996 and loved it---the light, modern decor that prevailed at that time seemed to blend perfectly with the colors of the San Diego Harbor., which the hotel overlooks (or used to). And the hotel was small enough to feel comfortable to me. My next visit to the hotel was in 2006 for a convention---which is the mainstay for this hotel. The hotel has grown enormously, and in my view, most of the character has been sucked out of it. A lot of the orientation of the original hotel toward the harbor has been replaced with an orientation toward a vast front lobby that would fit in well in Las Vegas. The light, contemporary style of the hotel (which seemed perfect for the setting, to me), has been replaced with a very commonplace pseudo-traditional look, that might be more appropriate in Kansas City or Columbus rather than in a waterfront hotel in San Diego. The hotel was overbooked the night I stayed there. Many people in our convention were "bumped" to stay at a nearby hotel---I'm glad I checked in early to avoid this fate (since the meetings were all at the Hyatt). Despite my complaints about the remodeling of the hotel, there are some positives. Its in a great location, and that won't change. Plus, many of the otherwise ordinary rooms do have great views. And the pricing generally seems in line with location and quality. In sum, I would go back to a business conference here, I just wouldn't go out of my way to stay here for pleasure (unless I got a really great weekend rate for a harborview room).

<Title>“Just an ordinary hotel”
<Content>We stayed at the hotel recently . Even though, we were given a room in of the top floors facing the bay, it was just a ok room. The room was not worth the $300 a night. The windows were dirty. We had drinks at the "Top of Hyatt" bar on the 40th floor. The service was bad and somehow I felt that the waitress was courteous towards fair guests. I felt the same behavior with the front desk at the Lael restaurant although, the waitress at this restaurant was extremely friendly. The parking elevators are dirty and the parking is expensive. Btw, we spent couple of weeks at a resort in Bali and were totally impressed with the service and friendliness of the hotel staff. Given that experience, we were totally disapponted with the overall experience at this hotel. I believe, the hotels in our country should learn from Asian counterparts regarding service. Overall, I am disappointed with the hotel except that the location is great. I will not stay at this hotel again!

<Title>“Great hotel for the Comic-Con!”
<Content>We had booked the room last year in sept, well before the event. I was happy to find out I received the exact room I asked for but unfortunately was not able to get my room until 2:30 pm. We stayed for 4 nights. We were given room 3739, which is a Regency Club room. We were on the 37th floor and at the very end of the hallway, nice and quiet. Plus the view of the convention center like I wanted. I think we only heard the train once, and even then we both asked eachother if we were sure we heard or just dreamed it. The room has lots of room and though the frig I requested, and never brought me, we managed to make room in the mini bar frig. The bed was somewhat comfy, but not what I was expecting from the pictures of a "feather bed". The sheets were nice. The bathroom had a nice shower head, but I must say that it definately shows it's age and resembles a bathroom in a Comfort Inn or Best Western. I can see how they added touches to try and avoid that appearence but they need to remodel all together. overall the room was comfortable with nice touches. The staff was very friendly and all very helpful and attentive. THe food was great! We ordered room service twice and while one night the guys ordered pizza from Domino's, I ordered a steak, with extra mashed potatos and creme brulee! We ate at the Buffet twice and enjoyed them both very much. We ate the breakfast buffet and I was very happy to see that they had the Dannon Lite-n-fit yogurt! (LA Weightloss friendly hotel!!). You get the usual options for the buffet and sweet fresh squeezed oj. We also ate at the Friday night seafood buffet. Pricy but worth it. The guys all had their fill of seafood and they mentioned that it tasted very fresh and good. I had my choice of salads and since I don't like fish, the chef at the buffet gladly tossed me up some pasta with a sauce minus the shrimp or lobster. I do like shrimp a little and I asked for a few shrimp just plained grilled. I got them just the way I asked. Since we had Regency Club (Concierge Level) we had our other breakfasts in there and it included everything except for the made to order omlettes. They always had cookies set out and for the night time they usually had cheeses and something hot like quesadilla rolls. Good stuff. We used them alot for the drinks. Saved alot of money! not having to buy them somewhere else and the goodies we took with us. Overall we had a good stay. Our room was reserved for us by my in-laws on points, but it can be pricey when reserving regular. Also It sells out quick for this time of year! It's just barely August and I already called to book next year and the Regency Club rooms are sold out!

<Title>“Hyatt high priced. Not so great for families”
<Content>My husband attended a conference at the Hyatt from 7/22-7/26. We brought the whole family along to spend some time together. We had requested a fridge for milk since we had preschoolers along. I had called a week in advance to double check this. If we could not, I would have booked at the Embassy suites across the street. They promised me that it would be ok. Well we never did get our fridge. They blamed it on the comic con that was going on. Comic Con ended our 2nd day but still not fridge. We were told to take things out of the mini bar with a note that we were not using these things and would put them back into the mini bar when we left. I hope now that we have checked out we are not charged for anything. Also the room was just a basic room but at Hyatt's high prices. Nothing special. The meals and room service was outrageous. $5 for a glass of OJ!!! We went to Ralph's and stocked up on water and snacks and never really ate anywhere down there except starbucks. The safe was not big enough to keep out lap tops in. The noise of the trains did not seem to bother us on the 20th floor. I was amazed that for the price of the rooms, the windows were soooooo dirty and I am not even a neat freak. All in all, with a family, I probably would not chose this hotel again. I would likely pick the marriott next door or the embassy suites across the street. They seem to be more accomodating to families and the marriott pool was beautiful. The hyatt pool was not kid friendly. Our kids were bored.

<Title>“Great View!!”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary and we loved it. I booked the corner King to guarantee we had a good view--and did we ever! We ended up staying in room 2851 of the Seaport Tower (northern tower, see photos for view), which provided breathtaking views of the bay, and on clear days you could see the ocean. The Hyatt website is not very helpful with respect to understanding where you want to be in the tower and which rooms are best so I called the reservation line. They requested that I be placed in the Seaport Tower, which is apparently newer than the Harbor tower (southern tower) and also requested a high floor. These requests seemed to work as I was granted both when I checked in. The rooms are about a C+ to B as Hyatt goes, and the bathrooms were nothing special, just your typical standard conference hotel bathroom. The room rate really only paid for the view not for a better room accommodation with respect to service, furnishings or fixtures. Housekeeping was OK as they did not put back the iron or ironing board, no big deal but for a high rate I would have expected better service. Self-Parking is $18 a day, but you can walk to Anthony's fish grotto, Seaport Village and Horton Plaza. The spa facilities are about B, and the massage I had was the same. The spa has a separate outdoor pool and hot tub, which I did not use. The "Top of the Hyatt bar" on the top floor of the Harbor Tower has good views and I would recommend it for a sunset drink if you have a clear day. Finally the hotel has two computers in the lobby where you can do online check-in for your airline and print boarding passes (a must these days). Overall I would recommend this hotel as it was clean, in a great location, the staff was above average and it has great views. I would not recommend this hotel for Kids as your better option in the Marriott next door, it has a great outdoor pool facility with waterfalls, slides and grottos.

<Title>“Loud train and very dated room”
<Content>Got to the hotel at midnight after a very long cab line at airport and no cabs. Hotel offered no assistance or advice whatsoever when I called from the airport wondering what to do. Was then awakened the next morning at 4:45 am by what sounded like a train literally coming through the hotel. Train's horn blew for over 20 minutes straight at nearly point blank range. As soon as the train sound stopped at 5:10 am, the phone rang with my wake-up call. Fine, they can't control the trains. Whatever. They can control the rooms, though. And this room in the Harbor Tower looked like any Best Western or La Quinta we have stayed in on the road through Wyoming and Nevada. Cheap polyester thin quilts on the bed. Late 70's early 80's dark wood decor. Worn sink and bathroom tile. Not worth 1/3 of the $349 my company was charged to put me here. If I had arrived earlier in the evening, I would have switched hotels. I called down to the front desk to ask if there were any more updated rooms - maybe in the newer tower - she said no they all look this way. Wow. This hotel has a beautiful lobby and wonderful bar area and great water location - rooms and train noise obviously make this a place to avoid for sleeping over. Avoid.

<Content>We were in San Diego for the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon and stayed at the Hyatt. Our initial impression was incredible. The entrance and lobby are amazingly swank. Very nice. But the rooms are much less impressive. For the price of $350, they're rather disappointing. Don't get me wrong, they're clean and nice, just not as luxurious as you'd expect for the money. But, knowing what I know, I'd stay again. Price being equal, I'd stay with them again, because I know it's clean, in a good location and has some great views.

<Title>“Great for a corporate traveler”
<Content>This Hyatt is a nice place if your in town for a convention or business. I was there with my family and although it is a VERY nice place it just had a corporate feel to it. Lots of business (convention) people milling around and the hotel charges for everything and I mean everything! The worst part of the hotel is the rock hard beds. It felt like we were sleeping on the floor. This was the third Hyatt we had stayed in on this trip and all the other beds were great! When I checked out and told the front desk person this they even said it is a complaint of many guests. The good news is the pool deck is great and the location is fantastic with a small villiage of shops right on the ocean just out the back of the hotel.

<Title>“Loved it!”
<Content>After reading some of the previous negative reviews, I was a bit hesitant to accompany my husband to a convention as I would be spending a good bit of time in the hotel room. I was more than pleasantly surprised. The room was larger than an average hotel room, with very nice traditional furniture and views toward the pool and the bay. I was pleased to find that, although I was in a tower (10th floor), the windows opened allowing sea breezes into the room. From the windows I could see the hills of Mexico, Catalina, Seaport Village, the bay with a constant parade of cruise ships and sailboats, as well as the swimming pool....lovely views. The room was immaculate. Room service was efficient and high quality and all of the employees were quite friendly and helpful. The bed was quite comfortable; the towels were not "threadbare". The previous complaints of lack of movie choices were unfounded as there were multiple new releases available with choices to suit varied tastes. The main lobby is absolutely beautiful. For those who complained that there were too many conventioners in the lobby, one must be mindful that the Hyatt is one block from the Convention Center and this is to be expected. It wasn't a problem for me. I also noted that, although this is a large hotel, there are enough elevators that one is not kept waiting and there is no feeling of being crowded. I have stayed at several hotels in San Diego over the years and I will definitely return to the Hyatt the next time we're in town.

<Title>“Very Nice 4 Star Hotel”
<Content>We stayed on the 18th floor in a King and loved it. It was a nice convention-oriented hotel. The location was wonderful, in the heart of all the action, the service was excellent and the rooms very nice. The rooms are four star quality- very comfortable beds, reasonable size rooms and nice bathfooms. Nothing was exceptional. It was no Ritz Carlton. I was with a group and several folks were disappointed in the rooms. I think they thought "Grand Hyatt" was going to be something special. It's not. "Grand" means its a big place, not opulent and fancy. If that's what you're looking for, you'll be disappointed. If you want very comfortable accomodations with plenty of amenities, the plac is fine. Parking is $24 valet, $20 self park. I used both and found self park easier and just as convenient. The spa was wonderful. Massages $125/hr with use of facilities for the day. The health club was $5 a day, and was without a doubt the finest health club of any hotel I have ever been to- as much equipmet as a real gym, even with yoga mats a pilates balls. All with a view of the city while working out. There are also excellent places to run in the area. My biggest gripe (and this is big) is that for some trason San Diego has freight trains gong through the area all night long with horns blowing. Woke us up 1-3 times every night. Other hotels in the area must have the same problem, but it was a bummer.

<Title>“Won't stay here again”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel for a convention. Was awakened at 2:15am by a knock and then a pounding on my door. I looked through peep hole and "security" man was there holding towels. I asked what he wanted and he replied that he was delivering the towels I ordered. I had been asleep and had to get up at 4:15am to catch a plane. I told him that I didn't order any towels and asked him to leave. He walked 10 feet from my door and stopped. I called the front desk to inquire why their employee disturbed me in the middle of the night and was scolded for not taking the towels I had requested. I called back and asked for the manager who told me that I had just been at the front desk asking for towels. When I informed the manager that I had been asleep, he said, "No, you just asked for towels 5 mintues ago here in the lobby." I suggested they improve their identification methods and try to match names with room numbers in the future. After several minutes he apologized for any "potential inconvenience". Room was "older" and not very clean. Filthy windows. Ice bucket liner never changed.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel, Nice Location!”
<Content>The hotel is beautiful inside and outside. The rooms are average...so I used my Hyatt Gold Passport membership and received an upgrade on our anniversary. The customer service agent was niec enough to give us an upgrade to a suite. The views are outstanding, as long as it's of the bay and not the other hotel or downtown. The price is a bit much for the area and what you get...but on an anniversary, it doesn't matter. I'd stay here again as long as they remember to tell me they don't serve breakfast on Sundays and instead serve brunch (we had to have continental).

<Title>“Great View if you request it”
<Content>I tried my luck on Priceline to get a better rate than I had reserved at a Holiday Inn (120) and got luck with the Hyatt Manchester at $130. I was very happy with the switch. This is a beautiful hotel. The lobby and the main lounge are very nice and the pool area has great views, although it was very windy up there. The room was very basic. Not as fancy as I thought it would be compared to the rest of the hotel, but the view of the bay was FANTASTIC. If you are a boat and water person, this hotel will not dissapoint. I actually am using my shot of the marina as my desktop now beacuse it was so nice. I would never spend rack rate at this hotel, but the Priceline rate was well worth it.

<Title>“BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE”
<Content>My niece drove 11 hours to meet me at the Grand Manchester. She arrived early & sat in the lounge area. She was soon surrounded by security guard and a Hyatt employee telling her she must not ever close her eyes in the lobby, it was not for vagrants. We had adjoining rooms reserved and she was waiting for the room to be available. She was soon told her room was ready. I arrived a few hours later. I was left waiting for 25 minutes while the desk clerk told me the adjoining room was inadvertently given to another guest. My niece then packed up and was moved to another tower of the hotel. The rooms were not clean. The amenities that were to have been in the room were not. I faxed a note to Ted Kanatas on 3/23/06 to inform him of his hotel employee problems. As of today, still no response. $1800 spent in 2 days and they simply....DONT CARE

<Title>“Nice, but could have been better”
<Content>As a Hyatt diamond member, I usually am given the best suite. Hyatt has put me in some of their finest suites. My reservation for the Manchester included using a suite upgrade certificate. Although there are almost 100 suites in this hotel, we were not in one of them. We did have an ordinary king room on the 32nd floor. It was on the regency floor, but it wasn't much different than the ordinary room.We did enjoy the regency amenities..breakfast, etc. We were originally assigned to a 5th floor shabby room behind the elevator overlooking a roof.. no view, noisy. We complained and were given the room with a nice view, but not anything special. We were promised a move to the finest suite the next day. It never happened. The hotel was quiet. It has a great location. Next to Seaport Village and close to the Gas Lamp district. Sally's restaurant is very good. I'd probably stay there again, if the price were good.

<Title>“Good Location, OK Hotel”
<Content>The Manchester Grand Hyatt, San Diego is a very large convention hotel with a great seaside location. The hotel has 1600+ rooms and all seem to have some view of the ocean. The rooms are surprisingly ordinary. The bed is not the "standard" Hyatt bed (all white bedding, feather top etc.). Instead it has a flower print polyester bedspread, and basic sheeting underneath. The bathroom is the standard tub/shower with marble sink. The hotel hallways were loud, and noise/doors closing could be heard while in the room. A couple of times, I was also able to hear the conversation of my next-door neighbor. Also, about every 5 -10 minutes there was this quiet, but noticeable pipe noise of some sort. The trains could also be heard from outside, but this was not so much a problem for me. The common spaces of the hotel are beautiful and staff was friendly and efficient. Aside from the common spaces and the wonderful location, however, the hotel is just ordinary. Not bad, but nothing too special. Location though, was a plus, especially if you are attending a convention or want to wander into the Gas Lamp Quarter. If I were to return to San Diego, however, I would likely go back to the W or Sheraton Suites (not as great a location though).

<Title>“Terrific if noisy”
<Content>First: beautiful hotel, gorgeous lobby (like Grand Central Station - impressive) central location and friendly staff. We were greeted and welcomed despite an early (11 am) arrival as we'd just gotten off a cruise ship. Our 24th floor room was spacious, spotless, and well-appointed. The beds are not quite up to Westin's "Heavenly Bed" level but very comfortable. We very much enjoyed this hotel EXCEPT - and this blows me away - there seems to be no soundproofing AT ALL. We could clearly hear phone conversations from other rooms and the sound of every door on the hall that opened and closed. Given all the other possible problems (the WBC was being played at Petco Park and the hotel was busy) we very much enjoyed the stay except for the noise.

<Title>“Pretty disappointed”
<Content>I stayed at the Hyatt Manchester in mid march for a conference. I was very surprised at how unimpressive the hotel is. Firstly, the rooms are extremely average, small and the bathrooms are old. The towels are very worn out and there is nothing special to the rooms. Though the hotel is large and appears nice from the outside, this is decieving. It is in a nice location along the water and adjacent to a seaport village with shops, that is about all it has to offer. The room rates are extraordinarily high and the gym is not free to use. Also myself and many others at the hotel had the same experience which is when we all checked in they told each of us that there were no king rooms left. However, if you insist, they go to a back room and return later to say that the manager gave permission to give out a king room. Basically, I think they are playing games with room assigments and they should not be doing this especially with the high room rates and the fact that if there are rooms available they should honor your original request. So i would strongly recommend staying elsewhere because this is not your typical hyatt experience for this room rate.

<Title>“Excellent Service at Grand Hyatt”
<Content>We had a very pleasant family vacation at the Grand Hyatt in San Diego. The rooms were nice; nothing extraordinary, but certainly adequate. And who goes to SD to stay in the hotel room?? Beyond the room, the service was excellent. We had our five-year old son with us and the staff could not have been more attentive to his and our needs. Check AAA and other sources for free breakfast packages--the breakfasts are great! Without the breakfast package, they would have been pricey, though. The breakfast staff, especially Surawit, treated us very well. If you don't have the free breakfast, there's a coffee shop across the trolley line with excellent coffee and pastries. One under-utilized secret: on chilly evenings, the fire pit on the far side of the pool was the place to be. We spent several evenings watching the evening harbor activities and sipping drinks (although we had to bring the drinks up from the lobby). The concierge desk was helpful to us. One negative was the lack of vending machines, an obvious attempt to capitalize on the mini-bar.

<Title>“Not for me”
<Content>I had to stay here for a convention in early March, 2006. When I checked in (I had requested a king size bed when I reserved) I was told there were no king size beds, and if I really wanted one, I'd have to pay to upgrade the room to a waterview. I did (my husband was with me) but it left a sour taste in my mouth- I hadn't checked in very late (5:30-6 PM) and it felt alot like the old 'bait & switch'. Next, the extra fees- from internet (when so many places provide it for free now) to parking that was way out of line with the area (our rental car was *less* expensive, per day, than the parking!) were pretty ridiculous. I will say, most of the staff was very nice (but you never saw anyone twice), the marble floor in the lobby was great, the bed (Westin's Heavenly bed has spoiled me!) and shower adequate (though the shampoo, which we just about used up that first morning, wasn't replaced, so the next day left us squeezing the empty little bottle, wishing for more), and, although I don't care much if they change the sheets every three days, I did have to call to get clean towels (which they change every 3 days, as well, unless you call) For an expensed convention, it was okay. For a family vacation, I'd find somewhere else.

<Title>“Overworked Housekeeping Staff”
<Content>Stayed for a quick overnight in-town getaway. The cleanliness of the rooms for the price is not worth it. Sheets are not changed everyday anymore. You have to request it. Towels not changed everyday either unless you request it. Hotel was over run by convention visitors. The Housekeeping Staff do the best they can, but they now have to clean 30 rooms a day (according to housekeeper that I talked to). Thats only 16 minutes a day. They used to clean 16 rooms a day. Which is the typical amount most hotels require their housekeepers. I worked for several years at a Marriott and that was they required from the housekeepers. 16 rooms equates to 30 minutes per room. This was confirmed recently by the local news. So, dont expect a very clean room if you stay here. For health reasons, I hope the Manchester Hyatt management staff realize that a room cannot be sufficiently cleaned and sanitized between guests. Do you want to stay in a hotel that only allows their cleaning staff 16 minutes to clean the mess of a previous guest? Otherwise, the views are outstanding. Convenient to the Gaslamp and Seaport Village Shopping/Dining area.

<Title>“Glorified Motel, Horrible!! Four Stars? Maybe in the galaxy of Yuck and muck.”
<Content>What a horrible hotel! After paying almost $200 per night to stay at this hotel through priceline we were extatic - this was, after all, supposed to be a four star hotel (300+ retail).. well.. Don't let the pretty high painted ceilings in the lobby fool you - you aren't staying in the lobby, after all. The moment we got to the room we realized the mistake we made - almost a week to spend in a small ugly dirty motel room. two tiny beds greeted us, covered in DIRTY old bedspreads. We asked that they be replaced.. only to be ignored. (the beds were so small, incidentally, that we sent our kids to sleep elsewhere in the city with their aunt every night. They liked it better there anyway...) The sheets on the beds - so thin... disgusting. The TV - small and very few channels. The amenities - thin bad shampoo and conditioner, thin and bad body cream, and soap I wouldn't want on any part of my body it is so drying. Yuck. The pool we saw from our window was ALWAYS empty. I wondered why until I sent my kids down to try it - it was COLD, they said. The sheets were not changed the whole time we were there... disgusting. The worst: The attitude of the front desk staff was HORRIBLE. They acted as if it was criminal of us to inquire, were not polite to us or our children, and generally couldn't care less if we were there or not. Just to be clear, we travel a lot on both business and pleasure.. see lots of hotels around the world and have never encountered a "four star" hotel with this level of dirt and mismanagement. Perhaps they have so much business from conferences they couldn't care less about other travelers. My recommendation: Don't go to this hotel.

<Title>“Food poisoning at its Grandest”
<Content>My husband and I decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt in downtown San Diego for my birthday weekend. We had stayed there for our anniversary and enjoyed that so we thought to try it again. Big mistake! After checking in we went to our unspectacular room--rust growing in the shower, uncomfortable bed, and worn carpet. We decided to go to the Top of the Hyatt for a drink and to catch the sun set. That was all right, if you like waiting for poor service. Once the waitress found out we were locals she was pretty nice. We paid the $90+ tab, 2 appitizers and 2 drinks apiece, we went back to our room. We decided to order in as we planned on getting up early and fishing the next morning. I ordered a hamburger (medium) and my husband ordered a chicken sandwitch. We were watching the olympics and had most of the light in the room off. The food came 35 minutes after we ordered it- frys were cold and our sandwitched seemed warm. Half way through my burger I realized that it was raw inside! We looked at it and it was fried on the outside and raw in the middle! Like a rush job was put on it. We never complain about food so we weren't gonig to start now. We should of! 3hours later in the middle of the night I was stricken with the worst food poisoning I've ever had! I won't go into details but it was not how you want to spend your birthday. The next day our plans blown I decided to make a complaint. I was given a free hamburger!! We'll never set foot in that place again...The Omni Hotel is just down the street and thats were we'll stay for now on. I have been trying to get in touch with anyone from the Hyatt and they won't repond. We spent alot of money with them to be brushed off!

<Title>“Convenient for a convention”
<Content>Very convenient for the convention center and Seaport Village, easy walk to the Gaslamp District. Hotel public areas are very nice but the rooms were nothing special, they were just your every day hotel room, Venetian and Treasure Island in Las Vegas were much nicer and much less expensive. For the money, I'd stay at the Omni or the marina Marriot next time we're in San Diego instead. Thought the $10/day for internet was nickel and diming since other hotels nearby supplied it for no cost. We had a great meal at The Fish Market nearby.

<Title>“Business hotel in great location”
<Content>A solid 4* hotel catering to conferences and meetings. The rooms are what you expect of a Hyatt, typical in size and amenities, very comfortable with decent views, but the bathrooms are dated. Closets were MUCH too small for even my limited needs for a 4 night stay. The safe took up about half, so long dresses and pants had very limited space in an already small space. The Club level was alright, but less than what I would expect for the upcharge. Fairly ordinary continental breakfast and just 1 hot dish at night. For a $50/nite premium, it wasn't worth it. The evening concierge gave us good restaurant recommendations and made the reservations cheerfully. Mostly the club staff ignored guests. Even on the Club floor there was a $10/day internet charge. I was with a meeting and got the discounted rate, but it still close to $300/nite+tax plus the internet and phone charges. The hotel has an excellent location. Walk out the back door of the Seaport tower and you're in Seaport Village with all sorts of things close at hand, mostly shops and restaurants and a nice walking path along the Marina and harbor. The Trolly stops here and a number of tours as well. The convention center is a long city block away. Sally's Restaurant had good seafood. Enjoyed the seared scallops. You can get sandwiches and cookies for lunch at one of the little shops. The meeting rooms are spread out over the two towers and you get your exercise! The main pool is much too small for a hotel with over 1,600 rooms, but it is a lovely spot. The food service for the meetings was excellent! Possibly some of the best I've had. The meeting layout didn't work well, but that may have been due to the fact that attendence was much higher than expected, so we ended up in a long narrow room. The lobby and lobby bar are good and there's shopping right in the hotel. But this is mainly a meeting hotel and it shows. About 1.5 miles to the restaurant area in the Gaslamp District. Try Greystone's for a good steak dinner - but bring your gold card! With no food or beverage charges, my 4 nite stay was over $1,300. Can't say it was worth it, but it had location!

<Title>“Great conference hotel”
<Content>The Manchester Grand Hyatt had all the things that a large conference hotel lacks: plenty of people to help, anticipation of crowded times or problems, available elevators, clean uncrowded restrooms, and defined spaces. Check-in and check-out were smooth and efficient. They knew a crowd was coming and had staff on hand to make it work. I was stopped several times by hotel personnel to ask if they could help me find something. They know how to identify lost participants just by their walk or facial expression. Despite a large crowds, I never had to wait more than a minute for an elevator. Rooms were expensive, but clean and spacious.

<Title>“Disappointing Stay at the Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego”
<Content>I wanted to give this hotel a stellar review and they definitely started out strong, but the level of service fell off so sharply and so quickly that I can't recommend the Manchester Grand Hyatt to anyone looking for a hotel in downtown San Diego. When we first checked in, my fiance and I were given a room on the 37th floor and four coupons for breakfast in Lael's, one of the hotel's restaurants. We were very pleased. We got up to our rooms and were a bit disappointed - it was a very generic hotel room, but it had a nice view and was very quiet. I had a a really unpleasant surprise when I went to take a shower, however. There were toenail clippings lining the edge of the bathtub. Gross. As our stay progressed, the service became very bad. We had to call and request toilet paper and Kleenex because we had run out after a few days. We also had to request the coffee packets, as they were never replenished. They never bothered to refill anything unless we specifically requested it. The concierge service is terrible. My fiance had a chipped tooth on his front tooth and the veneer fell off while staying at the hotel. We asked the concierge for her assistance, hoping that the hotel was affiliated with a dentist for emegencies. She handed us a list of pharmacies, hospitals etc., and at the bottom was a listing for 1 800 DENTIST! This was his front tooth and her only response was to recommend 1 800 DENTIST and tell him, "You'll have memorable photos!" Unfortunately, this is a direct quote. The physical space is very nice, but the shoddy service overrides everything else.

<Title>“OK, but not great”
<Content>We were hoping to stay in a really nice hotel....but this didn't quite meet our expectations. All of the public areas are in excellent condition and are very impressive (lobby, pool, entrance etc.). The downside for us is that it is a convention hotel full of people attending conventions so there were a lot of people milling around the lobby areas all of the time, many of whom appeared to have never stayed in a nice hotel before. This detracted from our experience as it no longer felt as if we were staying at a nice hotel. The rooms are decent but the bedding and decor is dated and could stand to be updated. The walk to the Gaslamp district is 10-15 mins, which is fine as long as you know that. Friends of ours on the same trip stayed at the Omni and it was much nicer as it was newer, smaller and closer to downtown. I'd stay at the Omni if I went back.

Checked in, no one knew of our requirements, first room was twin bed room, second room given was opposite elevator, finally when I said we were checking out they gave us a king room on the 22 floor. Not good to go though all of that, then the next two days we had no replacement towels or soap. All this from a $200 room.. not good. I contacted the manager but again he wasn’t interested..

<Title>“Great stay, great location!”
<Content>We stayed at the Manchester for my husband's business trip. I'm not sure what the cost was per night but probably more than we would normally pay. We were content with the room. The bed spread was ugly and not high quality. And the bed I slept on aggrevated my back problems. But since they gave us a room with two double beds, I switched to the one my husband was sleeping on and it was much better. The pool area was nice and we were in the hot tub every night, watching the sunset. The only other thing I didn't like was that the fitness room had a fee. Otherwise, the location was great! And the staff was very friendly. We didn't try any of the restaurants so can't give an opinion on those. I would certainly stay here again. Other things I would recommend while visiting San Diego are taking the Old Town Trolley tour (stop at the Seaport Village which is right by the hotel) and the Shout! House in the Gaslamp District.

The room was spacious with a comfortable bed and a nice big bathroom. It is within walking distance of everything you need - Gaslamp, ball park, shops, marinas. My only suggestion is try to get a room as far away from the trolley as possible - the constant dinging drove me up the wall.

<Content>My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt for our last night in San Diego after originally staying three nights in San Diego and one in Huntington Beach. It was the end of our first trip to San Diego while celebrating our first anniversary and we were looking for a hotel just to relax in. When we checked in, the very professional girl told us that we were on the 32nd floor in a corner room which afforded us views of downtown, the stadium and Coronado and for the price, the room could not be beat. I had read reviews of the rooms being a little tired and in need of a rennovation, but everything else made up for that. The room was also very clean. The food from room service and in Lael's restaurant was excellent. It is also next to Seaport village which has many shops and restaurants and makes for a nice walk in the evening. We would return to this hotel again.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel”
<Content>My Fiance and I stayed at the Manchester Grand over the weekend of Aug. 27 - 28. I would definately recommend this hotel for a couple that wants to go down to San Diego for a nice romantic getaway, or just a fun weekend trip. This was our first time actually visiting the city and staying over a couple of days, other than just driving down to Sea World for the day. I have to say that this hotel is perfectly placed between everthing you might want to get to: San Diego Zoo which we visited for the first time, is less than 10 minutes away. You have the Gaslamp District which I must say is definately a happenin' place for the 21+ crowd. We were amazed at the number of pubs, bars, clubs in the district and just how the street was filled of 20 something crowd well dressed and ready for a party in the whole district. Just for this alone we are going back. Definately an enjoyable nightlife and good time to be had by singles and couples alike. Gaslamp district is a 10-15min walk depending if your girl is wearing high heels, or you can hop on one of the waiting bicycle taxi ($20 for two people) and its 5 min away. Seaport village is directly outside of the hotel, with boat and jet ski rentals right outside of the hotel. Harbor cruise is a short walk away too. Soooo...We stayed in a corner room on the 17 floor of the Harbor Tower. Beautiful! Nice size room. We will definately stay here again next time we visit San Diego. And if your a govt employee the price can't be beat, but even if it wasnt at the govt rate I would definately stay here again.

<Title>“Very poor service, very little concern”
<Content>Having experienced several other downtown luxury hotels, I decided to stay at the Hyatt this trip. It was a disaster from the time I drove my car into the driveway! It was 15 minutes before a valet person came up to me as I waited by my car....I had already unloaded all of my luggage. I was in the old building...carpet was nasty. The next day they started contruction hammering tiles out in an ajoining room. When I called to complain, they said it could not be stopped. They did move me, which was EXTREMELY inconvenient since I had already unpacked for my 4 night stay. The blanket on the bed in both rooms was old and unattractive. The bathrooms in the newer wing are much nicer than the old section, but I would have expected down comforters in a 4 star hotel. I did ask for, and receive a down comforter, which I was told was for VIP's only. I was very disappointed. This hotel is further from the convention center than many others. They could have won me over with a simple apology and offer of a glass of wine, or a chocolate strawberry.Didn't happen.

<Content>I stayed for six nights while I was in town for a conference. This hotel was uniformly clean and pleasant. The location is truly excellent - steps from the Seaport Village and many shops/restaurants, about a ten-minute walk to the Gaslamp District. Transportation by taxi, pedicab, and trolley is easy. Many rooms also have a nice view of the bay and marina. (There is an Embassy Suites virtually across the street which shares many of these same positives. A friend stayed there during the conference and was very positive about the experience.) However, I did not feel that this is quite the luxury hotel that I was expecting or that the high price was really justified. The room, which had one king bed, was small and didn't offer any special amenities beyond those that can be found at any hotel. The bed and linens were comfortable, but not on par with beds found at the Sheraton or the Westin. The pool was also small, although it was generally not too crowded. All in all, I enjoyed my stay, but I would hesitate to pay such a high price again.

<Title>“Great hotel!!!!”
<Content>We stayed for a weekend at this hotel in July. The rooms are very clean and the best part is the view from the rooms. You can see the entire harbor from your own large room window. The view is spectacular both in the day and night. The service at the hotel is 5 star caliber. The restaurant at the hotel was also good. Nice buffet breakfast. The location of the hotel is also very ideal since it is right by the marina. As soon as you walk out the hotel you are right in the Seaport Village area with the nice shops and walking area along the marina. Lots to do there and see. Good places to eat along that area as well. The location is also great for zoo goers. The San Diego Zoo was only a 5 minute drive. The concierge can also arrange ticket purchase prior to going ot the zoo so you don't wait in any long lines. I would definitely stay there again. My only knock on the place is the thin walls. The previous reviewer also made a similar comment. I could definitely hear conversation from the adjacent room wbile trying to fall asleep. Also.... don't forget to stop by their cocktail lounge in the evening at the top floor. Great view from there as well.

<Title>“Great views, Best Location and Nice room”
<Content>We stayed here during the 4th of July holiday. The hotel consists of two 35+ floor buildings, side by side. Almost all rooms have partial or full view of the bay. You can open the window in the room to let the fresh air in giving you the oceanic feeling. However, it does not have a terrace. Room is well appointed. (Standard 4+ star hotel) If you are looking for a terrace, you may want to go to Marriott, located next door. This is a huge hotel with plenty of nice restaurants and a nice pool deck. Everything is nice and grand. Seaport Village is just behind the building and Gas Lamp Quarter is just a 10-minute walk. You can even ride a pedi-cab to down town.

<Title>“Excellent location”
<Content>The location of the hotel is excellent. Seaport village is literally right outside the door. You can walk to Little Italy, The Midway, The Gaslamp District and Horton Plaza. Service at the front desk is polite if not always completely competent. Check your folio using the t.v. daily. This will prevent problems when checking out. The lobby is very impressive. The rooms are typical Hyatt rooms - clean and comfortable- but nothing special. There is not enough draw space. Close your window at night if you don't want to hear the trolley. Overall quite satisfied and would return for the excellent location.

<Title>“Pleasantly Surprised!”
<Content>Overall I was pleasantly surprised with my stay at the Hyatt. I've stayed at many Hyatt's in the past, but this was by far the most impressive. I was attending a conference at the Convention Center (with 12,000 other people) and so the $229 per night initially seemed high, but ended up being justified. The hotel is right next to Seaport Village, and just a short walk to the Gaslamp District (10 mins). I was told the hotel was going to be completely full, so I expected a long wait at check-in. Not the case, the staff were courteous and efficient, as were the Concierge staff. The room was pretty average, nothing to write home about, however, the view of the ocean and the pool made up for the mediocrity. If I had to pick a flaw with the room, it would be that the decor was a little bland and could perhaps benefit from a minor face-lift. I visted one of the bars in the hotel (several times) and was surprised to find that the prices weren't outrageous. the bartenders were attentive and friendly. The bar is situated in a beautiful, comfortable and very spacious lobby. I also visited Lael's (one of the hotel's restaurants) for the breakfast buffet and for dinner. The food was above average, but it was the service that made my visit memorable. Both times I was blown away by the level of personal service that the staff offered. The hostess remembered my name, the bus-boy and server were extremely friendly and offered polite conversation (maybe because I was dining alone). All in all, it's the decadent look of the hotel and the customer service that I'll remember about my stay at the hotel, and will be the reason that I'll return next time I'm in San Diego.

<Title>“Nice downtown location, but noisy”
<Content>We recently stayed at this hotel during a conference. We brought our 2-year old and paid a little extra for a corner suite which gave us more room. It was a great set-up and our views of the harbor were spectacular. One thing we were not so happy about was the trolley and train noise about every three hours...until 2:00 am. If you're a light sleeper, this is not the best place to be. Although, I'm not sure if anywhere in downtown San Diego would be any more quiet. Staff is excellent, pool is great, and location to Maritime Museums, Seaport Village, and Gaslamp Quarter is perfect.

<Title>“Nice Hotel but to much for what you get”
<Content>We just returned from our trip to San Diego and figured I would write a review on the two hotels we stayed at while we was there. I used the TripAdvisor while planning our trip so I thought it was only fair to write a review for other travelers. We checked into the Manchester Grand Hyatt on June 3, 2005 and checked out on June 6 (Quick overview of this hotel) Pros: Clean, nice view from rooms, very quite (we didnt hear a single thing at night), friendly staff, sits right on the Seaport Village (shopping center), Near trolley stations and Petco Park Cons: $18 per night parking fee for self parking and $24 a night for Valet (where else are you gonna park) , rooms are small, beds are smaller, for the average traveler prices are way to high ($6 for a liter of water in the room, $9 for a Coffee and a muffin at their Starbucks in the hotel, too many examples to write them all) Overall a nice hotel. Perfect hotel for someone who has lots of money and doesnt care about some of the added cost. Not so perfect if your there for a family vacation and are trying to watch how much you spend.

<Title>“Loved it!”
<Content>After reading the other comments about the noise the trolley's made and how it disturbed their sleep... all I have to say is YOU'VE got to be kidding me. Yes, you may hear a train or two before falling into a deep sleep but its soooo faint there is no way it could disrupt sleep. Plus, I was grateful to have a trolley stop right in front of the hotel so that I could get around town easier. Overall, I found the hotel to be beautiful, clean and quiet. I would recommend it and I would go back and stay there again.

<Title>“Don't Judge a Room by the Hotel Lobby”
<Content>We stayed at the Manchester Hyatt for two nights. We had booked it through Hotwire so the price was average. First of all when you walk into the Hotel Lobby you are blown away. The grandeur and the size of the Lobby along with the amount of staff that works there, makes you think you are at one of the best hotels around. Well, when you get to the room, it's nothing at all like what the lobby looks like. The rooms are soo outdated and plain. I think there are more beautiful bathrooms at the Hampton Inn or Best Western. The hotel staff is very friendly. The hotel is humungous, however we would not stay there again. For the name Hyatt and the amount that we had paid, we were expecting more than what we got.

We were next to the Seaport Village, Convention Center, and all the nice restuarants on the fifth ave. The view from our room at night was spectacular. The people in the front desk were very helpful.

<Title>“Great Location and Views!”
<Content>I justed returned from 5 nights at this wonderful hotel. The location is perfect. Seaport Village is behind the hotel. We stayed in a sea view room in the Seaport Tower. The view of the bay and pier area was beautiful. It is within walking distance of many restaurants, the cruise ship pier, the Midway and harbor boat tours. I attended a large convention and found the service much better than I expected. My room was cleaned each morning, not at 3:30 like a lot of hotels. I enjoyed the breakfast buffet but allow plenty of time since so many guests want to eat right before their meetings. I would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Very nice...beautiful view”
<Content>All in all this is a very nice hotel. The rooms were comfortable but nothing special. I was most disappointed in the bathroom. It was small by luxury property standards and quite mundane in styling. However, great pressure in the shower. I always appreciate good water pressure at a hotel as it seems like it is a rarity these days. Our view from our window was spectacular. The lobby is very large and well decorated. The pool is only so so. They could use a lot more loungers. The pool bar was very small and always crowded. An outdoor bar/grill area would be appreciated. The spa and workout facilities are nice. The bar at the top of the hotel is really awesome at night but the prices are exorbitant! The staff was always very friendly at the property...well managed. The location is good. Seaport Village is adjacent and the gas lamp district is a $5 taxi ride or a 10 minute walk away. If you can get a rate around $200-250 a night it is well worth it but don't pay more than that.

<Title>“Classy hotel while maintaining convenience”
<Content>My fiance and I stayed here, on a whim, for the weekend of April 23rd, and it basically ended up feeling like we were on a honeymoon. I'm not a connoisseur of fancy hotels, but I thought this place was very nice and luxurious. The elevators were fast and convenient; the room was good sized and had a very nice view of the harbor and city. It had a desk with a wired high-speed connection (not free), and the bathroom had a decent sized tub. The air conditioning worked well, and the window cracked open so you could hear the ambience of downtown (basically the trolley crossing every 20 minutes). With the window closed, it was comfortably quiet at night. There were tons of facilities including pool/jacuzzi deck, spa, tennis courts, gym, top floor restaurant, and a LOT more. The look and feel of this hotel seemed to reflect a classic or old fashioned nature- polished stone floor lobby, lots of fine woods, brass, and complimentary tones. I usually don't like staying at higher end hotels because I hate dealing with all the extra steps, tips etc. However, this hotel offered self parking, and overall, everything was really straightforward. On a minor note, the proliferation of the Manchester family photos throughout the hotel was a little awkward. I'm not sure what they were trying to achieve with this, but it could be perceived as self-aggrandizement. We took advantage of the Grand Getaway package, which for $209/night, included free self parking, free breakfast buffet, discounts around town, and (apparently) a room with a nice view. To our pleasant surprise, our room was on the 28th floor of the harbor tower, even though we didn't spend the extra money for the "really nice view" upgrades (I forget what they were really called). The only snafu we hit was that we didn't get breakfast vouchers when we checked in, so they were going to charge us $72 for our breakfasts when we were checking out. When I tried to resolve it with one of the ladies at the desk (Rosie), she told us that the reason we were charged was because we ate from the wrong buffet. She even "double-checked" with someone (or pretended to) and confirmed that this was probably the case. This didn't make sense to us, because there were no other breakfast buffets in the hotel, so we asked to speak to someone else. The person we then spoke to was much nicer. She explained that we should have received vouchers (when we checked in) that we could use at the buffet. She apologized for this not happening, and said that sometimes it's difficult to keep track of all the details of the packages and offers. She credited the charges and we were on our way.

<Title>“Beautiful public space + below average sleeping rooms = 3 out of 5 stars.”
<Content>I’m seasoned business traveler so expectations are high when rooms are $200+ a night. Our stay was in early March for 4 nights for a mini-vacation. Hotel is centrally located, 10 minutes from airport. Lobby magnificent, front desk staff a little confused as to how to book 2 nights using points and 2 nights paying. Hotel public space and sleeping rooms are very clean, loads of meeting space, numerous onsite restaurants. I agree COMPLETELY with previous listing, **While the exterior and public areas were quite 'grand' we found the room to be somewhat disappointing. The room was 'tired' and in need of updating. The bathroom fixtures were older, the sink and taps worn, and the wallpaper peeling and poorly patched. We found the bed to be of mediocre comfort. It was overly firm and the sheets did not stay on particularly well. The pillows were small and not very fluffy.** I expect luxury linens at a Grand Hyatt rather than icky old-fashioned polyester bedspreads and scratchy sheets. Unfortunately the Regency Level was full, so we had a regular room with two double beds. The bathroom had zero ventilation. We couldn’t dry our hair in the bathroom as it was too stuffy! This place is super-busy with business and leisure travelers - each time we went to the front desk, concierge or valet there was a line. Very diverse gift shop, nice spa (ask for Victoria – she gave me a fantastic haircut/style and discount coupons for the following day’s facials). On the downside: I treated my friend to her first facial, I was disappointed that the facial attendant did not do a consultation on my friend’s skin – my friend didn’t know any better but for $100 I expected more. Spa overlooks lovely pool and Jacuzzi that overlooks the bay. We did not eat in any of the hotel restaurants as the hotel is walking distance to the Gaslamp district of hot restaurants, bars and boutiques. Next door to the Seaport is filled with souvenir shops, overpriced restaurants, and ice cream/fudge shops. Skip the Seaport. Hotel is next to trolley that heads to Tijuana, concierge has map and recommended restaurants if you head over the border.

<Title>“large with attitude”
<Content>I am a travel agent and was recently a guest at this hotel when I travelled with my husband, who was attending a convention. The hotel is on a grand scale, with all of the opulence in the lobby. The bar off of the lobby is loud (ceilings are very high, marble floors, etc) when there is a crowd occupying it, so much so that it seems like a roar upon entering the hotel. There are beautiful murals, vast check in desk, efficient bellstand personnel. The negative aspects are these: For such a grand hotel, every morning, we had no hot water. This seemed to happen to a lot of people! The business center was very small, and located in one of the towers (there wasn't one for each tower-how inconvenient for guests!), which is not close, if you're in the other tower. The rooms are relatively small, in comparison to what you think you'd be getting from viewing the lobby. The bathrooms are standard boring. Nothing redeeming here-not even the toiletries. The bedding is actually that fabric where you could slide off the bed if you're not careful, because its polyester, or some combination that makes it really slick! The mattresses were even a disappointment. Hallways were narrow, and not very bright. There was definitely no money spent on lobbies on each floor, with, for example two wing- backed chairs, a console table, lamp and flower arrangement would have been nice. Nope, nothing-only the bank of elevators in a smallish area, not enough room for embellishment. The restaurant (and I say one-not more than one in this hotel, believe it or not) was great, however, the service came with great attitude, and I ate there twice (dinner, and breakfast). I must say, however, that room service was very efficient, and everything ordered from them was even more than expected. The bar on the 40th floor had a fantastic view, with mediocre service, and a sad appetizer list...probably because its too far from the kitchen to have anything presentable, so, it has to be something that can be microwaved by the waitstaff. I called the hotel manager the morning I had no hot water, and immediately had three "engineers" in my room, however, according to the bell staff, this hot water thing is an ongoing problem, and not the "mixing valve" as I was fed by the manager. My husband and I attended functions at the convention center, which sometimes necessitated that we rode the bus provided. The buses would not come up the drive to pick us up (which was troublesome in the rain), and it may have been because they were asked not to. We couldn't figure it out. In regard to location, there were some other hotels within closer proximity to the convention center (Marriott and Hilton), and others closer to shopping and Gaslight district.

<Title>“Near the pier”
<Content>We (I and my wife) stayed at the Grand Hyatt on March 11, 2005. We were going out of San Diego on a cruise and wanted a hotel which was close to the cruise port. The Hyatt turned out to be just what we wanted. It is relatively close to the airport and within easy walking distance of the cruise terminal. It is also close to the Gaslight district and adjacent to Seaport Village. We had the morning to explore, so we walked to the Gaslight district and through the Seaport Village to the cruise terminal. It was a Saturday morning, so not too much was happening. The area seemed nice and we had no problems. We had booked a Regency Club room and were not disappointed. The room was very comfortable and adequately large for our needs. We did hear the train once but otherwise it was quiet. The breakfast in the Club lounge was excellent, with very good croissants, coffee, and smoked salmon. There were other choices as well--that's just what we tried. We've had mixed experiences at Hyatts in the past few years, but I can recommend the Manchester Grand Hyatt. Check-in and Check-out were quick and easy. All of the staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful. The hotel itself is very pretty and is in a nice area. Of course, your experience may vary from ours, but we would stay here again.

<Title>“Nice hotel, great location.”
<Content>I stayed at the Manchester Hyatt at the beginning of February. The hotel is nice and has a great location. You are right at Seaport Village and within walking distance of the Gaslamp district. There are plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. The hotel is also only a few miles from the airport. If you like to run, the hotel has a great location. I am a runner and you were right along a waterfront path that stretched for miles. The rooms were nice, but nothing special. The staff was friendly and helpful. My only complaint about the Hyatt, and it has nothing to do with the hotel, is that fact that freight trains pass by across the street from the hotel. These trains pass by throughout the night and blow their whistles as they pass. You can hear the whistles for about 10 minutes as the train approaches the hotel and then as it moves further away. Each night I was awakened several times as these trains passed. Again, it is not the hotel's fault, but be aware, especially if you are a light sleeper.

<Title>“Facility was great, but service questionable”
<Content>This hotel was wonderfully magnificent from the huge driveway to the large and lavish lobby. We stayed in the new tower and were very pleased with the decor in the room. The bathroom was very well appointed, furniture more than sufficient, and carpet nice and plush. The size of the room was a bit on the small side, but given the enormity of the hotel, it wasn't too bad. We had a nice view of the pool, the Coronado bridge, and Seaport Village. We even caught a glimpse of the fireworks displayed at night. I fell in love with the hotel from the time I walked through the doors. But the only thing I really loved was the aesthetics. Service: C'mon Hyatt... you can do much much better. I have stayed at many Hyatt properties from Grands to Resorts (I have yet to stay at a Park) and I was highly disappointed with the service I received at this particular hotel. The front desk agent was nothing more than polite when I checked in- adequate service, nothing specatcular. However, throughout the course of my three day stay, I encountered very arrogant agents at the desk. Perhaps its the fact that they are quite busy almost every time I passed, but there was a lack of interest showed when I made certain requests (like adding my frequent airline points). I barely was able to say "thank you" when I was rudely dismissed when the agent called for the next guest and looked at me as if to get out the way. Another gripe is that the self parking line was always long! It took us about fifteen minutes in line to finally get to a parking attendant. If you happen to stay here on a seemingly busy weekend like I had, allow ample time for the parking garage. The garage not only caters to hotel guests but to the general public as well, which is probably why parking was the way it was. I didn't get a chance to utilize a lot of the other amenities like room service, restaurants, or pool since I was only in town for a wedding. All in all, the hotel itself was gorgeous and definitely worth the amount they charge. But if you're expecting to be wowed off your feet like at other Hyatts, you might not get the best treatment. But the convenient location to the bustling San Diego atmosphere can't be beat.

Bottom line: The room was very clean, bathroom was very clean, beds were very comfortable. In short, everything I could ask for. Decent views depending on the location & level of your room. We happened to be in the upper floors & our view was obstructed by the building next door. Was able to access the internet downstairs using the hotel's computer/service but it is somewhat pricey. Very nice shops below and was treated with kindness by all employees. Parking garage was convenient and easily accessible If you have the cash, I would highly recommend the Manchester. Someday I will make it back

<Title>“Highly recommended!”
<Content>Our trip to San Diego was enhanced by staying at the Manchester Grand Hyatt. Our vacation was from December 28, 2004 - January 1, 2005. We paid a rate of $199.00 per night on Hyatt. Our room, which was located on the 28th floor of the Seaside Tower, was clean, quiet, spacious, and comfortable. Each day, my husband and I were pleased with the housekeeping and the concierge services. The hotel staff were consistently friendly and polite. This hotel is best for travelers who appreciate an urban location close to fine dining and shopping. Our view was fantastic! From our room, we had a perfect view of downtown San Diego's skyscrapers, hills in the distance, the San Diego Bay, US Midway, and Coronado Island. The hotel cafe/deli was great for tastey semi-affordable breakfast and lunch items. Try Ralph's grocery store, which is within walking distance, for afforable meals. Also nearby is a great coffee shop, "It's a Grind". The hotel common areas do become busy and crowded with conference guests. Our stay coincided with the Holiday Bowl (Cal vs. Texas Tech) and a related Cal Alumni conference (we are not Cal alumni.) Still, the excellent service, views, and location make up for the busy atmosphere.

<Title>“Opulent lobby, ordinary rooms”
<Content>The first impression of the Hyatt is quite breathtaking. Both the porch and the lobby are among the grandest I have seen in the US, with loads of wood, huge rennaissance-style paintings and acres of marble. The rooms, however, were very ordinary. I had a room in the harbor tower, and it bordered, dare I say, on the quality of a motel. A good motel, no doubt, very clean and spacious, but with nothing of the luxury touches you expect at the Hyatt. I had just stayed two weeks at the Westin down the road, and this room was quite a contrast. Unattractive bathrooms, very ordinary beds, flannel throws instead of comforters and an irritating shortage of powerpoints (I had to disconnect the table lamp to plug in my laptop). Also, TVs that neither pull out nor swivel, so the only place you can see them is in bed. The chairs at the desk were the regular dinner-table kinds that don't swivel or lean or cna be adjusted for height. All in all, very unfriendly to the business traveller. The views, however, were quite nice. All in all, nothing wrong with the hotel - just nothing to be ecstatic about. Acceptable for the $99 I got it for in Priceline, but the Westin, the Omni and the Hilton - all within walking distance of the hotel - are substantially better. They are also closer to the Gaslamp than the Hyatt, which is the main dining area of downtown.

<Title>“Beautiful views from Harbor Tower”
<Content>I stayed here two nights while attending a very large seminar. I agree with the prior comments that this hotel frequently features large crowds of conference-goers, but it seemed to me that the hotel staff is completely capable of handling these crowds. The staff was consistently very pleasant, attentive, and helpful. I was on the 20th floor of the Harbor Tower and the views were just stunning. I could have just stayed in my room, ordered room service, and enjoyed the views of Navy vessels and sail boats in the bay. The outdoor pool is smallish, but the entire patio area is quite large, and, again, has a great view of the San Diego Bay. The hotel is very nicely located between the Seaport Village (which has good, if not great, restaurants) and the Gaslight District (which has great restaurants). The Embarcadero Marina park (just out the hotel's back doors) is beautiful, with great running/walking paths. The hotel is also quite close (by bus or car) to Balboa Park. Overall, I would certainly stay here again, and I think it would be a good hotel for a family's vacation.

<Title>“Five Nights is enough”
<Content>Too large all round, a convention/conference venue, facilities very good but restaurant areas and cosy nooks tend to be cordoned off for this group or that, room in the Sea Port tower fine and clean etc, nice furnishings and a comfy bed, just a little soulless but I would guess most of the hotels at the Harbor are basically for groups, saw the Omni, nice rooms and very modern, more on a human scale than the Hyatt but more groups, went to the Del Coronado and that was swarming with business groups who I presume pay well but do nothing for the atmosphere........so think about your purpose carefully, too cool weatherwise at this time, layers and /or sweaters a must ,go to La Jolla for an intimate time

<Title>“Nice Hotel, central San Diego”
<Content>Stayed here for 3 nights as aprt of a business conference, discounted room rate but it was still fairly steep, the additional $16 a night self parking and $10 a night Internet charges were not too welcome. The foyer is probably the most impressive part of the hotel. The hotel has 2 towers Harbour and Seaport views, no real preference for either, I was in seaport and had a view of a aircraft carrier which I believe is a tourist attraction, windows could do with a clean, but getting outside on a tower this tall is not too easy. Air Con was very noisy and I had to turn it off to be able to get to sleep. Room quality as good and well maintained by hotel staff. Food and bar was good. Easy 10 minute walk to gaslamp district or local mall in central of town. Friendly reception staff.

<Title>“Very Nice Stay at Hyatt”
<Content>My husband and I just returned from a long weekend over the Columbus Holiday. The hotel is very nice. There were several parties and convention events going on Friday night, since this is a large convention style hotel. However, it didn't affect our stay. We tend to prefer the smaller boutique style hotels, but we got a great rate, and read the good reviews on Tripadvisor so we gave it a try. The concierge and front desk staff were pleasant, helpful and very efficient. The location is great, right on the marina/bay area at Seaport Village which has lots of shops and restaurants right outside of the hotel. We has a rental car, but didn't need it. The trolley stop is right across the street and the Gaslamp District is in walking distance. Rooms were OK, nothing special, but clean and bathrooms were nice and spacious. Overall, a very nice stay and would recommend if you get a good rate.

<Title>“Great hotel”
<Content>Great location on the water. Lobby is beautiful, staff were helpful. Self parking was $16 per day, little steep but there is no where else to park. Hotel is next to seaport village, and the Seaport tower overlooks the Midway aircraft carrier which is open to the public . Rooms are average size, bathrooms have been updated with all modern amenities. Would recommend.

<Title>“Nice hotel, friendly staff, average rooms”
<Content>Stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Sept. 18 for 4 nights in the Seaport Tower on the 17th Floor. The room was very clean. Nothing fancy, a typical Hyatt room. I had reserved a king non-smoking, but at check-in they let me know there was a room with two double beds which had a view of the water. I took the room with the view which was nice since you could see the fireworks from PETCO Park. I heard a train a couple of times but it was not loud enough to bother me. The staff at the front desk was very friendly. Room service was good, the wait staff was also friendly. The location is good because it is less than a 10 minute drive to the airport, a five minute drive to the Gaslamp District, and easy to access the expressways. If I came back to the area, I would stay here again.

<Title>“Beautiful lobby and property, average rooms”
<Content>I stayed in the Manchester Grand Hyatt for a weekend in September. The hotel is incredible. Enormous lobby, beautiful pools, great facilities. However, the rooms are very blah, although the harbor tower has goregous views from the top floors.

<Title>“ok but...”
<Content>The hotel is very nice, but try not to be put in the seaport tower. We were on the 11th floor and could hear the trolly, the train and a tugboat at 2:30 in the morning. Try to stay in the harbor tower...we had colleagues stay there and they did not hear any of these noises. The rooms are nice, but lack drawer space and we had to constantly ask for more towels and soap and lotion were not replaced regularly. It is centrally located...good but not my favorite place I have stayed.

<Title>“Excellent hotel”
<Content>A lot of times I book 4 star hotels and discover I was mislead and that the hotel is a 3 star. My experience at the Manchester Grand Hyatt was just the opposite. This is a 5 star hotel that is advertised as a 4 star. The lobby is incredible. The staff is outstanding. They do need to wash the windows but that is aminor complaint. Within a five minute walk of Petco Park and the Gaslamp Quarter.

<Title>“Nice but a little cheesy!”
<Content>The hotel is nice, in a great location. The pool and location are is top selling points. I had heard great things about the rooms in the "new tower" but was a little disappointed. The decor is very cheesy. A little underwhelmed. Service was consistently average.

<Title>“looks like 4 star, acts like 3”
<Content>When you first enter this hotel, prepared to be amazed by the grandeur of the lobby area. This has to be the hotel's best feature. This hotel is so big, too big to be personal. It was quite an adjustment coming from Hilton La Jolla, just 20 min. up the road, in which we had a very pleasant stay the night before. The room that was given to us was on the 27th floor and admittedly was very good size with plenty of space, however, the decor seemed very outdated and ugly (dark green flower beddings, the kind you would find in your grandma's house). We had a partial (like 10 %) water view and the rest was overlooking the city, but windows were dirty which kind of reduced the impact of the view. By the way, there is no balcony. The bathroom floor had hairs and we had to call to request some bath robes as there were none present in the room. They took forever to bring them and we found stains on them when they finally arrived. The major disappointment was the swimming pool/spa area. Too small for a hotel this size (it was like my friend's apartment swimming pool) and we were packed like sardines in the jaccuzi. If you fancy a peaceful swim, you need to get up early). We had a AAA deal which included free breakfast buffet. When you enter the restaurant the first thing you see is an amazing gourmet brunch buffet. But don't be fooled, we discovered that this was not part of the AAA deal, and we were shown to a smaller lesser value breakfast selection. It was still nice, but it was like dangling candy in front of a child and then taking it away. Parking is expensive, $16 overnight. The checking staff and concierge were very helpful, but restaurant hostess came across very rude. We liked our waitress though. The hotel is only a few blocks from the gaslamp district and 5 min. walk from the marina. We don't think we would stay again, not for the price we paid.

<Title>“Loved the Manchester!!!”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel last July and didn't have all that great of an experience, but I was anxious to get back and see the latest renovations. We arrived early to the hotel and decided to see if we could check-in early. We asked if it was too early to check-in and he said, 'absolutely not.' We were in the Seaport tower with a king, non-smoking room, on the 27th floor. We booked our room through Priceline for a very discounted price. After check-in, we gazed at the amazing new lobby. Beautiful floors, murals, lighting, and furniture decorate the gigantic space. Our room was tastefully decorated and had a wonderful partial view of Seaport Village and then of the harbor. We had a nice armoire with the TV, in room safe, and refrigerator fully stocked with munchies and drinks. Our king sized bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. There was an over sized desk and a chair and ottoman conveniently placed right near the window. The bathroom was very elegant. However, our only complaint, the water pressure was a little weak, nothing too major, however. The hotel work-out facilities are very impressive. Each treadmill had its own flat screen TV. There were also steppers, ellipticals, free weights, and bicycles. There was a charge for using the facilities, $5.00/day, but being a Hyatt Gold Passport member, it's free. The main pool area is very nice and a great size. We had lunch up at the grill one day and were very impressed with the service and value. I also had a massage at the hotel which was unbelievably relaxing! I enjoyed the steam spa and sauna for total relaxation. With any spa services, one can use the spa pool for the day, otherwise, it would be $5.00/day. We had delicious breakfast items at the Redfield Deli and also enjoyed having drinks at the Top of the Hyatt bar one evening. (Prices are a bit spending, but definitely go and check out the view!) Location wise, this was perfect. We were very close to the Gaslamp district, along with Seaport Village, and a quick trolley ride or taxi can take you to Old Town or the zoo in about 10 minutes. We were 100% satisfied with our room, the concierge/hotel staff, location, and best of all price.

<Title>“Great hotel, locations, and very clean......!”
<Content>We stayed at this Hotel on August 1, 2004, the day on my son's birthday after a long day at Legoland. The hotel is very nice, inside and the room is very clean. The staff were very nice and gave us the high floor room so we can see the nice overlooking view of San Diego. I was very surprised with the room, because is pretty big and clean, especially the bathroom. The self parking fee is now $16.00. This hotel has a great location, very close from the Gaslamp district. You can find a lot of nice restaurants at the Gaslamp district, from American to Italian restaurants (even live music Jazz club!). I would definitely stay in this hotel again, because it's the PERFECT 4* hotel!

<Title>“Great location, typical hyatt room.”
<Content>We stayed at the manchester grand hyatt. truly this is a grand hotel and the art within the hotel is amazing. the staff at the hyatt for cordial and very accomodating. the location is unbeatable... although you may want to check out the Marriott hotel right next to the Hyatt... that hotel is pretty nice on the outside. the hyatt is right near seaport village which is a main attraction, you can always hop on a ferry by seaport village and go over to coronado. the rooms were kinda boring. they were very typical... hyatt looking. they all look the same when you walk in. other than that it was great location and decent room.

<Title>“Very Nice hotel...Great Location”
<Content>Our stay was August 6-7, 2004. The Hyatt is very striking on the San Diego skyline with its two 29-story towers. The location is great, right on the harbor with views in all directions. The back doors of the hotel put you in Seaport Village with many quaint shops and a variety of eating options. There are walking paths and grassy areas to lounge. Both pools were open the weekend we stayed and there was no extra charge. That may have been an exception, I'm not sure. The pool area is very nice and the water actually warm. Our room was not especially large, but the size was adequate and it was very clean. We booked on Priceline and feel we got a great deal. We were not treated any differently than anyone else as far as I could see. We requested a king non-smoking room and that's what we got along with a view of the harbor and pool area. The $16 parking charge is steep, but not out of line with other downtown prices. We plan on going again--hopefully soon!

<Title>“loved the Manchester”
<Content>We stayed here on July 11-14, 2004. The hotel was beautiful. They put us in the Seaport Tower on the 14th floor. We needed two full size beds and they accomodated us even though we booked through priceline. The room was quiet, though you could hear the train whistling in the distance, not too bad. The room wasn't large, but it was adequate. The bathroom was nice and large. We ate some meals at Seaport Village, it was convenient, directly behind the hotel, the Village had a food court, which the food was inexpensive and decent. The self parking garage was $16 per day. The pool was nice, with two hot tubs, lounge chairs with cushions and thick towels. It was definately a four star experience in my opinion.

<Title>“Great visit”
<Content>We just returned from a 4 night stay at the Grand Hyatt. We got our rooms (2) through priceline for a rate of $80 each and were very pleased with everything. Since we arrived on July 3rd and they were sold out we were not able to get a king non-smoking room, but on Sunday, they were able to accommodate us, and moved our luggage for us while we were gone. They moved us across the hall so we were still able to be close to my mom who was in the other room. Would definitely stay here again.
